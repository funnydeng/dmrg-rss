      <title>The surface code beyond Pauli channels: Logical noise coherence, information-theoretic measures, and errorfield-double phenomenology</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21055</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Jan Behrends, Benjamin Béri&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We consider the surface code under errors featuring both coherent and incoherent components and study the coherence of the corresponding logical noise channel and how this impacts information-theoretic measures of code performance, namely coherent information and quantum relative entropy. Using numerical simulations and a phenomenological field theory, focusing on the most general single-qubit X-error channel, we show that, for any nonzero incoherent noise component, the coherence of the logical noise is exponentially suppressed with the code distance. We also find that the information-theoretic measures require this suppression to detect optimal thresholds for Pauli recovery; they thus require increasingly large distances for increasing error coherence and ultimately break down for fully coherent errors. To obtain our results, we develop a statistical mechanics mapping and a corresponding matrix-product-state algorithm for approximate syndrome sampling. These methods enable the large-scale simulation of these non-Pauli errors, including their maximum-likelihood thresholds, away from the limits captured by previous approaches.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21055'&gt;arXiv:2412.21055&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 30 Dec 2024 16:14:55 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Evidence for a $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ Dirac spin liquid in the generalized Shastry-Sutherland model</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00096</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Atanu Maity, Francesco Ferrari, Jong Yeon Lee, Janik Potten, Tobias Müller, Ronny Thomale, Rhine Samajdar, Yasir Iqbal&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We present a multimethod investigation into the nature of the recently reported quantum spin liquid (QSL) phase in the spin-$1/2$ Heisenberg antiferromagnet on the Shastry-Sutherland lattice. A comprehensive projective symmetry group classification of fermionic mean-field Ans\"atze on this lattice yields 46 U(1) and 80 $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ states. Motivated by density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) calculations suggesting that the Shastry-Sutherland model and the square-lattice $J_{1}$-$J_{2}$ Heisenberg antiferromagnet putatively share the same QSL phase, we establish a mapping of our Ans\"atze to those of the square lattice. This enables us to identify the equivalent of the square-lattice QSL (Z2A$zz$13) in the Shastry-Sutherland system. Employing state-of-the-art variational Monte Carlo calculations with Gutzwiller-projected wavefunctions improved upon by Lanczos steps, we demonstrate the excellent agreement of energies and correlators between a gapless (Dirac) $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ spin liquid -- characterized by only few parameters -- and approaches based on neural quantum states and DMRG. Furthermore, the real-space spin-spin correlations are shown to decay with the same power law as in the $J_{1}$-$J_{2}$ square lattice model, which also hosts a $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ Dirac spin liquid. Finally, we apply the recently developed Keldysh formulation of the pseudo-fermion functional renormalization group to compute the dynamical spin structure factor; these correlations exhibit the features expected due to Dirac cones in the excitation spectrum, thus providing strong independent evidence for a Dirac QSL ground state. Our finding of a $d$-wave pairing $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ Dirac QSL is consistent with the recently observed signatures of QSL behavior in Pr$_2$Ga$_2$BeO$_7$ and outlines predictions for future experiments.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00096'&gt;arXiv:2501.00096&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 30 Dec 2024 19:00:00 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Tensor network method for solving the Ising model with a magnetic field</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01098</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Myung-Hoon Chung&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We study the two-dimensional square lattice Ising ferromagnet and antiferromagnet with a magnetic field by using tensor network method. Focusing on the role of guage fixing, we present the partition function in terms of a tensor network. The tensor has a different symmetry property for ferromagnets and antiferromagnets. The tensor network of the partition function is interpreted as a multiple product of the one-dimensional quantum Hamiltonian. We perform infinite density matrix renormalization group to contract the two-dimensional tensor network. We present the numerical result of magnetization and entanglement entropy for the Ising ferromagnet and antiferromagnet side by side. In order to determine the critical line in the parameter space of temperature and magnetic field, we use the half-chain entanglement entropy of the one-dimensional quantum state. The entanglement entropy precisely indicates the critical line forming the parabolic shape for the antiferromagnetic case, but shows the critical point for the ferromagnetic case.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01098'&gt;arXiv:2501.01098&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 02 Jan 2025 06:46:29 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Xuanzhao Gao, Xiaofeng Li, Jinguo Liu&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs) are a class of problems that are ubiquitous in science and engineering. It features a collection of constraints specified over subsets of variables. A CSP can be solved either directly or by reducing it to other problems. This paper introduces the Julia ecosystem for solving and analyzing CSPs, focusing on the programming practices. We introduce some of the important CSPs and show how these problems are reduced to each other. We also show how to transform CSPs into tensor networks, how to optimize the tensor network contraction orders, and how to extract the solution space properties by contracting the tensor networks with generic element types. Examples are given, which include computing the entropy constant, analyzing the overlap gap property, and the reduction between CSPs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00227'&gt;arXiv:2501.00227&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 31 Dec 2024 02:30:34 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Clifford circuits Augmented Matrix Product States for fermion systems</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00413</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Jiale Huang, Xiangjian Qian, Mingpu Qin&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Clifford circuits Augmented Matrix Product States (CAMPS) was recently proposed to leverage the advantages of both Clifford circuits and Matrix Product States (MPS). Clifford circuits can support large entanglement and can be efficiently simulated classically according to the Gottesman-Knill theorem. So in CAMPS, MPS needs only to handle the so-called Non-stabilizerness Entanglement Entropy which significantly improves the simulation accuracy for a given bond dimension. In this work, we generalize CAMPS to study the Fermion system by taking advantage of the Jordan-Wigner transformation which can map the studied Fermion system to a spin system. We benchmark the method on both the spinless $t-V$ model and the spinful Hubbard model. Our test results show significant improvement of the accuracy of CAMPS over MPS, especially when the interactions are strong. Fermionic CAMPS provides a useful tool for the accurate study of many-body fermion systems in the future and has the potential to help resolve long-standing issues.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00413'&gt;arXiv:2501.00413&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 31 Dec 2024 12:31:22 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Quantum many-body dynamics for fermionic t-J model simulated with atom arrays</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00552</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Ye-Bing Zhang, Xin-Chi Zhou, Bao-Zong Wang, Xiong-Jun Liu&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The fermionic t-J model has been widely recognized as a canonical model for broad range of strongly correlated phases, particularly the high-Tc superconductor. Simulating this model with controllable quantum platforms offers new possibilities to probe high-Tc physics, yet suffering challenges. Here we propose a novel scheme to realize a highly-tunable extended t-J model in a programmable Rydberg-dressed tweezer array. Through engineering the Rydberg-dressed dipole-dipole interaction and inter-tweezer couplings, the fermionic t-J model with independently tunable exchange and hopping couplings is achieved. With the high tunability, we explore quantum many-body dynamics in the large J/t limit, a regime well beyond the conventional optical lattices and cuprates, and predict an unprecedented many-body self-pinning effect enforced by local quantum entanglement with emergent conserved quantities. The self-pinning effect leads to novel nonthermal quantum many-body dynamics, which violates eigenstate thermalization hypothesis in Krylov subspace. Our prediction opens a new horizon in exploring exotic quantum many-body physics with t-J model, and shall also make a step towards simulating the high-Tc physics in neutral atom systems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00552'&gt;arXiv:2501.00552&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 31 Dec 2024 17:28:40 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Noise-Mitigated Variational Quantum Eigensolver with Pre-training and Zero-Noise Extrapolation</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01646</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Wanqi Sun, Jungang Xu, Chenghua Duan&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; As a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm, the variational quantum eigensolver is widely applied in quantum chemistry simulations, especially in computing the electronic structure of complex molecular systems. However, on existing noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices, some factors such as quantum decoherence, measurement errors, and gate operation imprecisions are unavoidable. To overcome these challenges, this study proposes an efficient noise-mitigating variational quantum eigensolver for accurate computation of molecular ground state energies in noisy environments. We design the quantum circuit with reference to the structure of matrix product states and utilize it to pre-train the circuit parameters, which ensures circuit stability and mitigates fluctuations caused by initialization. We also employ zero-noise extrapolation to mitigate quantum noise and combine it with neural networks to improve the accuracy of the noise-fitting function, which significantly eliminates noise interference. Furthermore, we implement an intelligent grouping strategy for measuring Hamiltonian Pauli strings, which not only reduces measurement errors but also improves sampling efficiency. We perform numerical simulations to solve the ground state energy of the $H_4$ molecule by using MindSpore Quantum framework, and the results demonstrate that our algorithm can constrain noise errors within the range of $\mathcal{O}(10^{-2}) \sim \mathcal{O}(10^{-1})$, outperforming mainstream variational quantum eigensolvers. This work provides a new strategy for high-precision quantum chemistry calculations on near-term noisy quantum hardware.

      <title>Responses for one-dimensional quantum spin systems via tensor networks</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Jiayin Gu&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Tensor networks are adopted to calculate the responses for one-dimensional quantum spin systems that are initially in thermal equilibrium. The Ising chain in mixed transverse and longitudinal fields is used as the benchmarking system. The linear and second-order responses of the magnetization in $z$-direction induced by the time-dependent force conjugated with the magnetization in $x$-direction are calculated. In addition, the magnetization in $z$-direction is also exactly calculated in response to this excitation. As expected, the first two responses are shown to be excellent corrections to the equilibrium magnetization in $z$-direction when the excitation is weak. This result represents an illustrative example of the response theory for nontrivial quantum many-body systems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01920'&gt;arXiv:2501.01920&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 03 Jan 2025 17:42:33 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Stable excitations and holographic transportation in tensor networks of critical spin chains</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03084</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Zuo Wang, Liang He&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The AdS/CFT correspondence conjectures a duality between quantum gravity theories in anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetime and conformal field theories (CFTs) on the boundary. One intriguing aspect of this correspondence is that it offers a pathway to explore quantum gravity through tabletop experiments. Recently, a multi-scale entanglement renormalization ansatz (MERA) model of AdS/CFT that can be implemented using contemporary quantum simulators has been proposed [R. Sahay, M. D. Lukin, and J. Cotler, arXiv:2401.13595 (2024)]. Particularly, local bulk excitations (entitled "hologrons") manifesting attractive interactions given by AdS gravity were found. However, the fundamental question concerning the stability of these identified hologrons is still left open. Here, we address this question and find that hologrons are unstable during dynamic evolution. In searching for stable bulk excitations with attractive interactions, we find they can be constructed by the local primary operators in the boundary CFT. Furthermore, we identify a class of boundary excitations that exhibit the bizarre behavior of "holographic transportation", which can be directly observed on the boundary system implemented in experiments.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03084'&gt;arXiv:2501.03084&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 06 Jan 2025 15:27:19 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Enhancing Quantum State Reconstruction with Structured Classical Shadows</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03144</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Zhen Qin, Joseph M. Lukens, Brian T. Kirby, Zhihui Zhu&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Quantum state tomography (QST) remains the prevailing method for benchmarking and verifying quantum devices; however, its application to large quantum systems is rendered impractical due to the exponential growth in both the required number of total state copies and classical computational resources. Recently, the classical shadow (CS) method has been introduced as a more computationally efficient alternative, capable of accurately predicting key quantum state properties. Despite its advantages, a critical question remains as to whether the CS method can be extended to perform QST with guaranteed performance. In this paper, we address this challenge by introducing a projected classical shadow (PCS) method with guaranteed performance for QST based on Haar-random projective measurements. PCS extends the standard CS method by incorporating a projection step onto the target subspace. For a general quantum state consisting of $n$ qubits, our method requires a minimum of $O(4^n)$ total state copies to achieve a bounded recovery error in the Frobenius norm between the reconstructed and true density matrices, reducing to $O(2^n r)$ for states of rank $r&lt;2^n$ -- meeting information-theoretic optimal bounds in both cases. For matrix product operator states, we demonstrate that the PCS method can recover the ground-truth state with $O(n^2)$ total state copies, improving upon the previously established Haar-random bound of $O(n^3)$. Simulation results further validate the effectiveness of the proposed PCS method.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03144'&gt;arXiv:2501.03144&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 06 Jan 2025 17:09:38 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Field-Induced Ordered Phases in Anisotropic Spin-1/2 Kitaev Chains</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03329</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Mandev Bhullar, Haoting Xu, Hae-Young Kee&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Motivated by intense research on two-dimensional spin-1/2 Kitaev materials, Kitaev spin chains and ladders, though geometrically limited, have been studied for their numerical simplicity and insights into extended Kitaev models. The phase diagrams under the magnetic field were also explored for these quasi-one dimensional models. For an isotropic Kitaev chain, it was found that a magnetic field polarizes the ground state except along the symmetric field angle, where the chain is found to remain gapless up to a critical field strength where it enters an intriguing soliton phase before reaching the polarized state at higher field strengths. Here we study an anisotropic Kitaev chain under a magnetic field using the density matrix renormalization group technique, where the ground state has a macroscopic degeneracy with a finite gap in the absence of the magnetic field. When the field is mainly aligned parallel to the strong bond, four-site and large unit-cell ordered phases arise. In a certain angle of the field, another ordered phase characterized by a uniform chirality with six-site periodicity emerges. We employ a perturbation theory to understand such field-induced ordered phases. The effective model uncovers the presence of transverse Ising and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions between unit cells, as well as further-neighbor Ising interaction induced by the magnetic field, which collectively explain the mechanisms behind these ordered states. Open questions and challenges are also discussed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03329'&gt;arXiv:2501.03329&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 06 Jan 2025 19:00:21 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Automatic partitioning for the low-rank integration of stochastic Boolean reaction networks</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04157</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Lukas Einkemmer, Julian Mangott, Martina Prugger&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Boolean reaction networks are an important tool in biochemistry for studying mechanisms in the biological cell. However, the stochastic formulation of such networks requires the solution of a master equation which inherently suffers from the curse of dimensionality. In the past, the dynamical low-rank (DLR) approximation has been repeatedly used to solve high-dimensional reaction networks by separating the network into smaller partitions. However, the partitioning of these networks was so far only done by hand. In this paper, we present a heuristic, automatic partitioning scheme based on two ingredients: the Kernighan-Lin algorithm and information entropy. Our approach is computationally inexpensive and can be easily incorporated as a preprocessing step into the existing simulation workflow. We test our scheme by partitioning Boolean reaction networks on a single level and also in a hierarchical fashion with tree tensor networks. The resulting accuracy of the scheme is superior to both partitionings chosen by human experts and those found by simply minimizing the number of reaction pathways between partitions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04157'&gt;arXiv:2501.04157&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 07 Jan 2025 22:09:30 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

Hotta&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We performed high-resolution powder neutron diffraction experiments and discovered an elliptic helical incommensurate magnetic structure in the semiconducting rare-earth magnet YbCuS2, featuring effective spin-1/2 Yb$^{3+}$ ions that form a zigzag chain. Upon cooling the sample to 0.2 K, we observed very weak magnetic peaks indexed with an incommensurate propagation vector k = [0, 0.305, 0] along the zigzag chain. The magnitude of the magnetic moment is at least one-third smaller than the expected value for the Yb$^{3+}$ Kramers doublet ground state. In an applied magnetic field, up-up-down magnetic order was observed at 7.5 T, characterized by diffraction peaks indexed with k = [0, 1/3, 0] and substantial uniform magnetic components. These observations agree well with theoretical calculations based on the density matrix renormalization group for a zigzag spin-1/2 model with isotropic Heisenberg interactions and off-diagonal symmetric $\Gamma$-type exchange interactions derived from material parameters. The theory elucidates the quantum mechanical nature of the incommensurate magnetism as remnant off-diagonal spin correlations in a nematic dimer-singlet state.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04533'&gt;arXiv:2501.04533&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 08 Jan 2025 14:29:36 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

Wang, Hai-Qing Lin, Fei Wu&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The discovery of nontrivial topology in quantum critical states has introduced a new paradigm for classifying quantum phase transitions and challenges the conventional belief that topological phases are typically associated with a bulk energy gap. However, realizing and characterizing such topologically nontrivial quantum critical states with large particle numbers remains an outstanding experimental challenge in statistical and condensed matter physics. Programmable quantum processors can directly prepare and manipulate exotic quantum many-body states, offering a powerful path for exploring the physics behind these states. Here, we present an experimental exploration of the critical cluster Ising model by preparing its low-lying critical states on a superconducting processor with up to $100$ qubits. We develop an efficient method to probe the boundary $g$-function based on prepared low-energy states, which allows us to uniquely identify the nontrivial topology of the critical systems under study. Furthermore, by adapting the entanglement Hamiltonian tomography technique, we recognize two-fold topological degeneracy in the entanglement spectrum under periodic boundary condition, experimentally verifying the universal bulk-boundary correspondence in topological critical systems. Our results demonstrate the low-lying critical states as useful quantum resources for investigating the interplay between topology and quantum criticality.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04679'&gt;arXiv:2501.04679&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 08 Jan 2025 18:39:44 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Non-Markovian dynamics of BIC generation via single-photon scattering</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Giuseppe Magnifico, Maria Maffei, Domenico Pomarico, Debmalya Das, Paolo Facchi, Saverio Pascazio, Francesco V. Pepe&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The excitation of bound states in the continuum (BICs) in two- or multi-qubit systems lies at the heart of entanglement generation and harnessing in waveguide quantum electrodynamics platforms. However, the generation of qubit pair BICs through single-photon scattering is hindered by the fact that these states are effectively decoupled from propagating photons. We prove that scattering of a parity-invariant single photon on a qubit pair, combined with a properly engineered time variation of the qubit detuning, is not only feasible, but also more effective than strategies based on the relaxation of the excited states of the qubits. The use of tensor network methods to simulate the proposed scheme enables to include photon delays in collision models, thus opening the possibility to follow the time evolution of the full quantum system, including qubits and field, and to efficiently implement and characterize the dynamics in non-ideal cases, which turn out to be optimal for the BIC generation strategy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04691'&gt;arXiv:2501.04691&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 08 Jan 2025 18:56:22 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Chongyuan Xu&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Quantum compilation is the process of decomposing high-level quantum algorithms or arbitrary unitary operations into quantum circuits composed of a specific set of quantum gates. Neutral atom quantum computing platform is a quantum computing implementation method with high controllability and scalability, but its quantum compilation method is not mature. We systematically review the quantum compilation methods based on matrix decomposition, and propose a compilation algorithm suitable for neutral atom quantum computing, which can effectively decompose any unitary operation into a series of quantum gates suitable for the neutral atom platform, and ensure that the generated quantum circuits can run directly on the platform.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05266'&gt;arXiv:2501.05266&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 09 Jan 2025 14:20:32 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

Fermionic automata have been classified in terms of an index modulo circuits and the addition of ancillary systems. We strengthen this result removing the ancilla degrees of freedom in defining the equivalence classes. A complete characterization of nearest-neighbours automata is given. A class of Fermionic automata is found which cannot be expressed in terms of single mode and controlled-phase gates composed with shifts, as is the case for qubit cellular automata.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05349'&gt;arXiv:2501.05349&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 09 Jan 2025 16:22:15 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>The application of annealing in quantum cooling protocols</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05268</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Chongyuan Xu&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Inspired by simulated annealing algorithm, we propose a quantum cooling protocol which includes an annealing process. This protocol can be universally and efficiently applied to various quantum simulators, driving the system from an arbitrary initial state to the ground state with high fidelity. We have described the cooling process based on perturbation theory, validated the advantages of bath under time-modulated Zeeman field compared to bath under static one, and provided a justification for the necessity of an annealing process when the system to be cooled is unknown. We applied tensor network methods to numerically simulate our cooling protocol, using the transverse field Ising model (TFIM) as an example to verify the effectiveness of the protocol in cooling one-dimensional systems, two-dimensional systems, and systems with quantum noise. We compared the overall performance of cooling protocols with and without the annealing process on a test set generated with random parameters $g_P$. The results indicate that the cooling protocol with annealing process can achieve both accuracy and efficiency. Our results also show that the cooling protocol's resistance to noise depends on the type of quantum noise.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05268'&gt;arXiv:2501.05268&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 09 Jan 2025 14:24:07 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Kondo impurity in an attractive Fermi-Hubbard bath: Equilibrium and dynamics</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05562</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Zhi-Yuan Wei, Tao Shi, J. Ignacio Cirac, Eugene A. Demler&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We investigate theoretically equilibrium and dynamical properties of a Kondo impurity coupled to either 1D or 2D superconductors, modeled by the attractive Fermi-Hubbard model. By employing a non-Gaussian variational approach, we go beyond the approximation of a constant superconducting (SC) gap. We show that dynamical properties of the system can be modified qualitatively, when space and time dependent renormalization of the SC gap and electron-impurity hybridization are included. For the ground state, we find the singlet-doublet phase transition and $\pi$-phase shifts of the SC order parameter. For dynamics, first we consider spin dynamics following an abrupt connection of the polarized impurity to the 2D bath. We find rapid relaxation of impurity polarization and directional emission of a magnetization pulse, which becomes damped as it propagates into the bulk. Then we analyze transport between two SC leads coupled through the impurity at finite bias voltage. Here we go beyond analysis of the steady state to investigate full-time dynamics following an abrupt application of the bias voltage. We uncover four distinct regimes in the transient dynamics and transport properties: (I) the AC Josephson effect regime; (II) dynamical competition between charge-density-wave (CDW) and SC orders with transient Kondo correlations; (III) the coexistence of AC and DC currents facilitated by partial Kondo screening and dynamical stabilization of the SC order; (IV) DC Kondo transport regime modified by the SC order. Regime II exhibits a dynamical transition from SC to CDW order that locally restores the U(1) symmetry. We argue that our findings for regime IV provide a theoretical explanation for the experimentally observed anomalous enhancement of DC conductance and suppression of the AC Josephson current. Finally, we discuss the potential experimental realization with ultracold atoms.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05562'&gt;arXiv:2501.05562&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 09 Jan 2025 20:17:30 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Diabatic error and propagation of Majorana zero modes in interacting quantum dots systems</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06288</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Bradraj Pandey, Gaurav Kumar Gupta, Gonzalo Alvarez, Satoshi Okamoto, Elbio Dagotto&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Motivated by recent experimental progress in realizing Majorana zero modes (MZMs) using quantum dot systems, we investigate the diabatic errors associated with the movement of those MZMs. The movement is achieved by tuning time-dependent gate potentials applied to individual quantum dots, effectively creating a moving potential wall. To probe the optimized movement of MZMs, we calculate the experimentally accessible local density-of-states and time-dependent fidelity using many-body time-dependent numerical methods. Our analysis reveals that an optimal potential wall height is crucial to preserve the well-localized nature of the MZM during its movement. Moreover, for the first time, we analyze diabatic errors in realistic quantum-dot systems, incorporating the effects of repulsive Coulomb interactions and disorder in both hopping and pairing terms. Additionally, we provide a comparative study of diabatic errors arising from the simultaneous versus sequential tuning of multiple gates during the MZMs movement. Finally, we estimate the time scale required for MZM transfer in a six-quantum-dot system, demonstrating that MZM movement is feasible and can be completed well within the qubit's operational lifetime in practical quantum-dot setups.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06288'&gt;arXiv:2501.06288&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 10 Jan 2025 19:00:00 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Tensorization of neural networks for improved privacy and interpretability</title>

The method only requires black-box access to the target function and a small set of sample points defining the domain of interest. Thus, it is particularly well-suited for machine learning models, where the domain of interest is naturally defined by the training dataset. We show that this approach can be used to enhance the privacy and interpretability of neural network models. Specifically, we apply our decomposition to (i) obfuscate neural networks whose parameters encode patterns tied to the training data distribution, and (ii) estimate topological phases of matter that are easily accessible from the tensor train representation. Additionally, we show that this tensorization can serve as an efficient initialization method for optimizing tensor trains in general settings, and that, for model compression, our algorithm achieves a superior trade-off between memory and time complexity compared to conventional tensorization methods of neural networks.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06300'&gt;arXiv:2501.06300&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 10 Jan 2025 19:00:06 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Provable Low-Rank Tensor-Train Approximations in the Inverse of Large-Scale Structured Matrices</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07210</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Chuanfu Xiao, Kejun Tang, Zhitao Zhu&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; This paper studies the low-rank property of the inverse of a class of large-scale structured matrices in the tensor-train (TT) format, which is typically discretized from differential operators. An interesting question that we are concerned with is: Does the inverse of the large-scale structured matrix still admit the low-rank TT representation with guaranteed accuracy? In this paper, we provide a computationally verifiable sufficient condition such that the inverse matrix can be well approximated in a low-rank TT format. It not only answers what kind of structured matrix whose inverse has the low-rank TT representation but also motivates us to develop an efficient TT-based method to compute the inverse matrix. Furthermore, we prove that the inverse matrix indeed has the low-rank tensor format for a class of large-scale structured matrices induced by differential operators involved in several PDEs, such as the Poisson, Boltzmann, and Fokker-Planck equations. Thus, the proposed algorithm is suitable for solving these PDEs with massive degrees of freedom. Numerical results on the Poisson, Boltzmann, and Fokker-Planck equations validate the correctness of our theory and the advantages of our methodology.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07210'&gt;arXiv:2501.07210&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 13 Jan 2025 11:07:36 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

Employing the infinite projected entangled-pair states (iPEPS) technique, we can determine the magnetic ground states accurately and compare them to mean-field predictions to highlight the effects of quantum fluctuations. At half-filling, we analyze the transition between the antiferromagnetic and paramagnetic (Kondo singlet) phases as a function of hybridization and $f$-level energy, finding excellent agreement with existing quantum Monte Carlo studies in the case of hybridization. For $n = 1.5$ electrons per site, we identify a novel correlated antiferromagnetic diagonal stripe phase as the ground state, which competes with its ferromagnetic partner state.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07541'&gt;arXiv:2501.07541&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 13 Jan 2025 18:22:35 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Eiji Konishi&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; In this article, based on a recent formularization of the holographic principle proposed and investigated by the present author, we show that the weak equivalence principle in general relativity is equivalent to the equivalence between two forms of the Dirac constant, that is, the action of the spin degree of freedom in the two-dimensional Hilbert space and the lower bound in the quantum mechanical uncertainty relations. This result follows from an equation between the Euclidean and Lorentzian world-line actions of a massive particle divided by the Dirac constant, via the Wick rotation, by using the Euclidean and Lorentzian actions of a holographic tensor network, whose quantum state is classicalized by introducing the superselection rule.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07594'&gt;arXiv:2501.07594&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 09 Jan 2025 22:11:11 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

The tensor networks, particularly Tensor Product States (TPS) and Projected Entangled Pair States (PEPS), effectively represent these systems on two-dimensional lattices. However, the technical complexity of TPS/PEPS-based coding is often too much for researchers to handle. To reduce this problem, we developed TeNeS (Tensor Network Solver). This paper introduces TeNeS-v2, which extends TeNeS with real-time and finite temperature simulations, providing deeper insights into quantum many-body systems. We detail the new algorithms, input/output design, and application examples, demonstrating TeNeS-v2's applicability to various quantum spin and Bose models on two-dimensional lattices.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07777'&gt;arXiv:2501.07777&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 14 Jan 2025 01:21:07 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>A Low-Rank QTT-based Finite Element Method for Elasticity Problems</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Elena Benvenuti, Gianmarco Manzini, Marco Nale, Simone Pizzolato&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We present an efficient and robust numerical algorithm for solving the two-dimensional linear elasticity problem that combines the Quantized Tensor Train format and a domain partitioning strategy. This approach makes it possible to solve the linear elasticity problem on a computational domain that is more general than a square. Our method substantially decreases memory usage and achieves a notable reduction in rank compared to established Finite Element implementations like the FEniCS platform. This performance gain, however, requires a fundamental rethinking of how core finite element operations are implemented, which includes changes to mesh discretization, node and degree of freedom ordering, stiffness matrix and internal nodal force assembly, and the execution of algebraic matrix-vector operations. In this work, we discuss all these aspects in detail and assess the method's performance in the numerical approximation of three representative test cases.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07778'&gt;arXiv:2501.07778&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 14 Jan 2025 01:26:56 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Effective algorithms for tensor train decomposition via the UTV framework</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Yuchao Wang, Maolin Che, Yimin Wei&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The tensor train (TT) decomposition is used to compress large tensors into a more compact form by exploiting their inherent data structures. A fundamental approach for constructing the TT format is the TT-SVD, which extracts the TT-cores by the singular value decompositions (SVDs) sequentially. But in practical applications, it is often not necessary to compute full SVDs. In this article, we therefore propose a new method called the TT-UTV. It utilizes the virtues of rank-revealing UTV decomposition to compute the TT format for a large-scale tensor, hence requires less computational cost. We analyze the error bounds on the accuracy of these algorithms both in the URV and ULV cases, then recommend different sweep patterns for these two cases.

      <title>Intricately Entangled Spin and Charge Diffusion and the Coherence-Incoherence Crossover in the High-Dimensional Hubbard Model</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08121</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Gopal Prakash, S. R. Hassan, M. S. Laad, N. S. Vidhyadhiraja, T. V. Ramakrishnan&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Correlation-driven metal-insulator transitions and temperature-driven quantum-coherent-to-incoherent crossovers in correlated electron systems underpin the doping, temperature and frequency-resolved evolution of physical responses. Motivated by recent experimental studies that investigate the evolution of dynamical spin and charge responses, we analyze the spin and charge diffusion spectra in both half-filled and doped one-band Hubbard model using Dynamical Mean Field Theory (DMFT) combined with the Numerical Renormalization Group (NRG). We compare the relative strengths and limitations of Density Matrix NRG (DMNRG) and Full Density Matrix NRG (FDM-NRG) in capturing low-frequency spectral features and their evolution with temperature, interaction strength and band-filling. Key measures, including characteristic frequency scales, Kullback-Leibler divergence, diffusion constants, and kurtosis provide complementary but internally consistent picture for the evolution of spin and charge excitations across bandwidth as well as the band-filling driven Mott transitions and the coherent-incoherent crossover. We find that spin and charge fluctuations cross over from quantum-coherent-to-quantum-incoherent at distinct temperatures, providing a microscopic insight into the complex, two-stage, Fermi-to-non-Fermi liquid-to-bad metal crossovers seen in transport data, in particular in the $dc$ resistivity.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08121'&gt;arXiv:2501.08121&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 14 Jan 2025 13:56:46 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

Using a Rydberg quantum simulator, we study how TLL physics manifests in the low-energy properties of a spin chain, interacting under either the ferromagnetic or the antiferromagnetic dipolar XY Hamiltonian. Following quasi-adiabatic preparation, we directly observe the power-law decay of spin-spin correlations in real-space, allowing us to extract the Luttinger parameter. In the presence of an impurity, the chain exhibits tunable Friedel oscillations of the local magnetization. Moreover, by utilizing a quantum quench, we directly probe the propagation of correlations, which exhibit a light-cone structure related to the linear sound mode of the underlying TLL. Our measurements demonstrate the influence of the long-range dipolar interactions, renormalizing the parameters of TLL with respect to the case of nearest-neighbor interactions. Finally, comparison to numerical simulations exposes the high sensitivity of TLLs to doping and finite-size effects.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08179'&gt;arXiv:2501.08179&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 14 Jan 2025 15:03:51 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Denise Cocchiarella, Mari Carmen Bañuls&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We introduce a tensor network method for approximating thermal equilibrium states of quantum many-body systems at low temperatures. Whereas the usual approach starts from infinite temperature and evolves the state in imaginary time (towards lower temperature), our ansatz is constructed from the zero-temperature limit, the ground state, which can be found with a standard tensor network approach. Motivated by properties of the ground state for conformal field theories, our ansatz is especially well-suited near criticality. Moreover, it allows an efficient computation of thermodynamic quantities and entanglement properties. We demonstrate the performance of our approach with a tree tensor network ansatz, although it can be extended to other tensor networks, and present results illustrating its effectiveness in capturing the finite-temperature properties in one- and two-dimensional scenarios. In particular, in the critical 1D case we show how the ansatz reproduces the finite temperature scaling of entanglement in a CFT.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08300'&gt;arXiv:2501.08300&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 14 Jan 2025 18:29:20 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

We establish non-perturbatively that the nodal structure of the interactions gives rise to long-lived quasiparticle excitations that result in a diverging diffusion constant, even though the system is fully chaotic. Using a Boltzmann equation approach, we find that the charge mode acquires an anomalous dispersion relation at long wavelength $\omega(q) \sim q^{z} $ with dynamical exponent $z={\rm min}[(2n+d)/2n,2]$, where $n$ is the order of the nodal point in momentum space. We verify our predictions in one dimensional systems using tensor-network techniques.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08381'&gt;arXiv:2501.08381&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 14 Jan 2025 19:00:04 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Transformed Low-rank Adaptation via Tensor Decomposition and Its Applications to Text-to-image Models</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08727</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Zerui Tao, Yuhta Takida, Naoki Murata, Qibin Zhao, Yuki Mitsufuji&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) of text-to-image models has become an increasingly popular technique with many applications. Among the various PEFT methods, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and its variants have gained significant attention due to their effectiveness, enabling users to fine-tune models with limited computational resources. However, the approximation gap between the low-rank assumption and desired fine-tuning weights prevents the simultaneous acquisition of ultra-parameter-efficiency and better performance. To reduce this gap and further improve the power of LoRA, we propose a new PEFT method that combines two classes of adaptations, namely, transform and residual adaptations. In specific, we first apply a full-rank and dense transform to the pre-trained weight. This learnable transform is expected to align the pre-trained weight as closely as possible to the desired weight, thereby reducing the rank of the residual weight. Then, the residual part can be effectively approximated by more compact and parameter-efficient structures, with a smaller approximation error. To achieve ultra-parameter-efficiency in practice, we design highly flexible and effective tensor decompositions for both the transform and residual adaptations. Additionally, popular PEFT methods such as DoRA can be summarized under this transform plus residual adaptation scheme. Experiments are conducted on fine-tuning Stable Diffusion models in subject-driven and controllable generation. The results manifest that our method can achieve better performances and parameter efficiency compared to LoRA and several baselines.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08727'&gt;arXiv:2501.08727&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 15 Jan 2025 11:10:37 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

Here we develop a method based on path-integral molecular dynamics to solve this problem. Its accuracy is verified in a double-well chain model and it is applied to a real material from first principles. A quantum order-disorder-order phase transition sequence is demonstrated when varying the strength of quantum fluctuations using the lattice constants as the tuning factor. Combining the excitation spectra and R\'enyi entanglement entropy, we pinpoint the QD region. This picture may be general in lattice systems having soft phonon modes, not limited to quantum paraelectricity, in which novel entangled lattice motion and its coupling with other DoFs can be expected.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08801'&gt;arXiv:2501.08801&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 15 Jan 2025 13:50:11 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Breakdown of superdiffusion in perturbed quantum integrable spin chains and ladders</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08866</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Kevin Wang, Joel E. Moore&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Superdiffusive transport with dynamical exponent $z=3/2$ has been firmly established at finite temperature for a class of integrable systems with a non-abelian global symmetry $G$. On the inclusion of integrability-breaking perturbations, diffusive transport with $z=2$ is generically expected to hold in the limit of late time. Recent studies of the classical Haldane-Ishimori-Skylanin model have found that perturbations that preserve the global symmetry lead to a much slower timescale for the onset of diffusion, albeit with uncertainty over the exact scaling exponent. That is, for perturbations of strength $\lambda$, the characteristic timescale for diffusion goes as $t_*\sim \lambda^{-\alpha}$ for some $\alpha$. Using large-scale matrix product state simulations, we investigate this behavior for perturbations to the canonical quantum model showing superdiffusion: the $S=1/2$ quantum Heisenberg chain. We consider a ladder configuration and look at various perturbations that either break or preserve the $SU(2)$ symmetry, leading to scaling exponents consistent with those observed in one classical study arXiv:2402.18661: $\alpha=2$ for symmetry-breaking terms and $\alpha=6$ for symmetry-preserving terms. We also consider perturbations from another integrable point of the ladder model with $G=SU(4)$ and find consistent results. Finally, we consider a generalization to an $SU(3)$ ladder and find that the $\alpha=6$ scaling appears to be universal across superdiffusive systems when the perturbations preserve the non-abelian symmetry $G$.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08866'&gt;arXiv:2501.08866&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 15 Jan 2025 15:33:33 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Riemannian quantum circuit optimization based on matrix product operators</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Isabel Nha Minh Le, Shuo Sun, Christian B. Mendl&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We significantly enhance the simulation accuracy of initial Trotter circuits for Hamiltonian simulation of quantum systems by integrating first-order Riemannian optimization with tensor network methods. Unlike previous approaches, our method imposes no symmetry assumptions, such as translational invariance, on the quantum systems. This technique is scalable to large systems through the use of a matrix product operator representation of the reference time evolution propagator. Our optimization routine is applied to various spin chains and fermionic systems described by the transverse-field Ising Hamiltonian, the Heisenberg Hamiltonian, and the spinful Fermi-Hubbard Hamiltonian. In these cases, our approach achieves a relative error improvement of up to four orders of magnitude for systems of 50 qubits, although our method is also applicable to larger systems. Furthermore, we demonstrate the versatility of our method by applying it to molecular systems, specifically lithium hydride, achieving an error improvement of up to eight orders of magnitude. This proof of concept highlights the potential of our approach for broader applications in quantum simulations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08872'&gt;arXiv:2501.08872&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 15 Jan 2025 15:42:34 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

Exploiting Euclidean invariance, we use a quantization scheme where (imaginary) time runs perpendicularly to the defect. With this choice, correlation functions of local operators in the presence of the defect can be computed as expectation values of extended operators in the no-defect vacuum, which can be approximated by a homogeneous RCMPS. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this machinery by computing correlation functions of local bulk and defect operators in $\phi^4$ theory with a magnetic line defect, in perturbative, strong coupling, critical, and symmetry-broken regimes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09797'&gt;arXiv:2501.09797&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 16 Jan 2025 19:00:23 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Chung Po Ching&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Stark Many-Body Localization (MBL) is a phenomenon observed in quantum systems in the absence of disorder, where the presence of a linear potential, known as the Stark field, causes the localization. Our study aims to provide novel insight into the properties of Stark MBL and to discover unique entanglement characteristics specific to this phenomenon. The phase diagram analysis reveals different behavior with varying interaction strengths. Furthermore, we highlight the influence of domain wall structures on the breakdown of the entanglement entropy of the system. Moreover, the investigation of Out-of-Time-Ordered Correlator (OTOC) behavior demonstrates distinct responses to interactions based on domain wall configurations. Our findings contribute to a better understanding of Stark MBL and offer valuable insights into the entanglement properties of systems subjected to Stark potentials.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10211'&gt;arXiv:2501.10211&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 17 Jan 2025 14:11:02 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

M. Dean, Steven Johnston, Matteo Mitrano&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The Hubbard model is believed to capture the essential physics of cuprate superconductors. However, recent theoretical studies suggest that it fails to reproduce a robust and homogeneous superconducting ground state. Here, using resonant inelastic x-ray scattering and density matrix renormalization group calculations, we show that magnetic excitations in the prototypical cuprate ladder Sr$_{14}$Cu$_{24}$O$_{41}$ are inconsistent with those of a simple Hubbard model. The magnetic response of hole carriers, contributing to an emergent branch of spin excitations, is strongly suppressed. This effect is the consequence of d-wave-like pairing, enhanced by nearly an order of magnitude through a large nearest-neighbor attractive interaction. The similarity between cuprate ladders and the two-dimensional compounds suggests that such an enhanced hole pairing may be a universal feature of superconducting cuprates.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10287'&gt;arXiv:2501.10287&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 17 Jan 2025 16:31:05 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

Combining high-resolution neutron spectroscopy and density matrix renormalization group calculations enables a comprehensive analysis of the collective magnetic dynamics. We find a general absence of magnetic signatures from unpaired charges, indicating holes within the system form strongly bound localized Cooper pairs. A one-band Hubbard model fails to match the spectral features but a straightforward extension to a large attractive nearest-neighbor interaction quantitatively explains our results. Our finding shows the significance of additional interactions beyond the long-predicted quantum spin pairing in the ($d$-wave) charge pairing process. Considering the parallels between ladders and two-dimensional cuprates, these results are potentially relevant for square lattices as well.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10296'&gt;arXiv:2501.10296&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 17 Jan 2025 16:42:21 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Parent Lindbladians for Matrix Product Density Operators</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Yuhan Liu, Alberto Ruiz-de-Alarcón, Georgios Styliaris, Xiao-Qi Sun, David Pérez-García, J. Ignacio Cirac&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Understanding quantum phases of matter is a fundamental goal in physics. For pure states, the representatives of phases are the ground states of locally interacting Hamiltonians, which are also renormalization fixed points (RFPs). These RFP states are exactly described by tensor networks. Extending this framework to mixed states, matrix product density operators (MPDOs) which are RFPs are believed to encapsulate mixed-state phases of matter in one dimension. However, it remains an open question whether, by analogy, such MPDO RFPs can be realized as steady states of local Lindbladians. In this work, we resolve this question by analytically constructing parent Lindbladians for MPDO RFPs. These Lindbladians are local, frustration-free, and exhibit minimal steady-state degeneracy. Interestingly, we find that parent Lindbladians possess a rich structure, including non-commutativity for certain classes of RFPs, distinguishing them from their Hamiltonian counterparts.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10552'&gt;arXiv:2501.10552&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 17 Jan 2025 20:56:06 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Unraveling screening mechanisms in Kondo impurities using an NRG-MPS-based method</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10746</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Lidia Stocker, Oded Zilberberg&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The Kondo effect is a hallmark of strongly-correlated systems, where an impurity's local degrees of freedom are screened by conduction electrons, forming a many-body singlet. With increasing degrees of freedom in the impurity, theoretical studies face significant challenges in accurately identifying and characterizing the underlying mechanisms that screen the impurity. In this work, we introduce a straightforward yet powerful methodology for identifying the formation of Kondo singlets and their screening mechanisms, by utilizing the numerical renormalization group (NRG) combined with the matrix product states (MPS) technique. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on the single and two-level Anderson impurity models (AIM). Furthermore, we discuss potential generalizations of the method to multichannel and multiorbital Kondo impurities. Harnessing advanced tensor network techniques, our approach extends to complex impurity systems, offering a robust and versatile framework for studying Kondo physics.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10746'&gt;arXiv:2501.10746&lt;/a&gt;] Published Sat, 18 Jan 2025 12:13:25 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Rényi Entanglement of Purification and Half Rényi Reflected Entropy in Free Scalar Theory</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10944</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Liangyu Chen&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; In the AdS/CFT context, the entanglement of purification (EoP, denoted as $E_{P}$) of CFT is conjectured to be dual to the entanglement wedge cross section (EWCS) in bulk. However, another quantity called reflected entropy $S_{R}$ is also supposed to be dual to two times the EWCS. A natural question is whether they are the same in holographic CFTs even though they are different in general. Previous studies have shown $E_{P} \ge \frac{1}{2} S_{R}^{(n)}, n \ge2$ for random tensor networks. In this paper, we study this inequality beyond $n \ge 2$, and we focus on the range $0 &lt; n &lt; 2$. However, the calculations of EoP are notoriously difficult in general. Thus, our calculations mainly focus on the free scalar theory which is close to the holographic CFTs. We generalized the previous strategy for EoP in \cite{Takayanagi:2018sbw} to the R\'enyi case. And we have also presented two methods for R\'enyi reflected entropy, one is using correlators, the other one is Gaussian wavefunction ansatz. Our calculations show that the inequality still holds for $0 &lt; n &lt; 2$, and it may give us some insights into the equivalence of EoP and half reflected entropy in holographic CFTs. As byproducts of our research, we have also demonstrated the positivity of the R\'enyi Markov gap and the monotonicity of the R\'enyi reflected entropy in the free scalar theory.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10944'&gt;arXiv:2501.10944&lt;/a&gt;] Published Sun, 19 Jan 2025 04:56:13 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>On the correlation between entanglement and the negative sign problem</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11022</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Ping Xu, Yang Shen, Yuan-Yao He, Mingpu Qin&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; In this work, we study the correlation between entanglement and the negative sign problem in quantum Monte Carlo for the simulation of low-dimensional strongly correlated quantum many body systems. Entanglement entropy characterizes the difficulty of many-body simulation with tensor network state related methods, while the average sign measures the difficulty in many-body simulation for a variety of quantum Monte Carlo methods. Although there exist cases where one type of method works better than the other, it is desirable to find the possible correlation between entanglement and average sign for general hard strongly correlated systems regarding computational complexity. We take the doped two-dimensional Hubbard model as an example and numerically calculate the doping evolution of both the entanglement in the ground state with Density Matrix Renormalization Group and the average sign in the Auxiliary Field Quantum Monte Carlo simulation at low temperature. The results show that they are indeed correlated. The entanglement entropy (average sign) shows a peak (dip) around 20% doping, indicating that it is the difficult region for both methods. The vicinity of 20% doping is also the most intriguing region in both the Hubbard model and cuprate high-Tc superconductors where competing states with close energy intertwine with each other. Recognizing the correlation between entanglement and average sign provides new insight into our understanding of the difficulty in the simulation of strongly correlated quantum many-body systems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11022'&gt;arXiv:2501.11022&lt;/a&gt;] Published Sun, 19 Jan 2025 11:50:34 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian Lattice Gauge Theories: emergent properties from Tensor Network methods</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11115</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Giovanni Cataldi&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; This thesis develops advanced Tensor Network (TN) methods to address Hamiltonian Lattice Gauge Theories (LGTs), overcoming limitations in real-time dynamics and finite-density regimes. A novel dressed-site formalism is introduced, enabling efficient truncation of gauge fields while preserving gauge invariance for both Abelian and non-Abelian theories. This formalism is successfully applied to SU(2) Yang-Mills LGTs in two dimensions, providing the first TN simulations of this system and revealing critical aspects of its phase diagram and non-equilibrium behavior, such as a Quantum Many-Body (QMB) scarring dynamics. A generalization of the dressed-site formalism is proposed through a new fermion-to-qubit mapping for general lattice fermion theories, revealing powerful for classical and quantum simulations. Numerical innovations, including the use of optimal space-filling curves such as the Hilbert curve to preserve locality in high-dimensional simulations, further enhance the efficiency of these methods. Together with high-performance computing techniques, these advances open current and future development pathways toward optimized, efficient, and faster simulations on scales comparable to Monte Carlo state-of-the-art.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11115'&gt;arXiv:2501.11115&lt;/a&gt;] Published Sun, 19 Jan 2025 17:09:57 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Almost Strong Zero Modes at Finite Temperature</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11121</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Niklas Tausendpfund, Aditi Mitra, Matteo Rizzi&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Interacting fermionic chains exhibit extended regions of topological degeneracy of their ground states as a result of the presence of Majorana or parafermionic zero modes localized at the edges. In the opposite limit of infinite temperature, the corresponding non-integrable spin chains, obtained via generalized Jordan-Wigner mapping, are known to host so-called Almost Strong Zero Modes, which are long-lived with respect to any bulk excitations. Here, we study the fairly unexplored territory that bridges these two extreme cases of zero and infinite temperature. We blend two established techniques for states, the Lanczos series expansion and a tensor network ansatz, uplifting them to the level of operator algebra. This allows us to efficiently simulate large system sizes for arbitrarily long timescales and to extract the temperature-dependent decay rates. We observe that for the Kitaev-Hubbard model, the decay rate of the edge mode depends exponentially on the inverse temperature $\beta$, and on an effective energy scale $\Delta_{\rm eff}$ that is greater than the thermodynamic gap of the system $\Delta$.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11121'&gt;arXiv:2501.11121&lt;/a&gt;] Published Sun, 19 Jan 2025 17:30:10 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Katsumasa Nakayama, Manuel Schneider&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We propose a method to construct the initial tensor representation of partition functions and observables for the tensor renormalization group (TRG). The TRG is a numerical calculation technique that utilizes a tensor network representations of physical quantities to investigate physical properties without encountering the sign problem. To apply the TRG, it is essential to construct a locally connected tensor network suitable for recursive coarse-graining. We present a systematic approach for translating a general tensor representation of the partition function to this form. Furthermore, we show the dependence of TRG algorithms on the choice of the initial tensor network representation and propose an improvement of TRG algorithms in this respect&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11810'&gt;arXiv:2501.11810&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 21 Jan 2025 01:16:06 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Regularized dynamical parametric approximation of stiff evolution problems</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12118</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Christian Lubich, Jörg Nick&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Evolutionary deep neural networks have emerged as a rapidly growing field of research. This paper studies numerical integrators for such and other classes of nonlinear parametrizations $ u(t) = \Phi(\theta(t)) $, where the evolving parameters $\theta(t)$ are to be computed. The primary focus is on tackling the challenges posed by the combination of stiff evolution problems and irregular parametrizations, which typically arise with neural networks, tensor networks, flocks of evolving Gaussians, and in further cases of overparametrization. We propose and analyse regularized parametric versions of the implicit Euler method and higher-order implicit Runge--Kutta methods for the time integration of the parameters in nonlinear approximations to evolutionary partial differential equations and large systems of stiff ordinary differential equations. At each time step, an ill-conditioned nonlinear optimization problem is solved approximately with a few regularized Gauss--Newton iterations. Error bounds for the resulting parametric integrator are derived by relating the computationally accessible Gauss--Newton iteration for the parameters to the computationally inaccessible Newton iteration for the underlying non-parametric time integration scheme. The theoretical findings are supported by numerical experiments that are designed to show key properties of the proposed parametric integrators.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12118'&gt;arXiv:2501.12118&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 21 Jan 2025 13:29:36 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

Material simulations are essential computational tools extensively used in both academic research and industrial applications. TNs, originally developed in quantum mechanics, have recently shown promise in solving partial differential equations (PDEs) due to their potential for exponential speedups over classical algorithms. Our study successfully employs TNs to solve linear elasticity equations with billions of degrees of freedom, achieving exponential reductions in both memory usage and computational time. These results demonstrate the practical viability of TNs as a powerful classical backend for executing quantum-inspired algorithms with significant efficiency gains. This work is based on our research conducted with IKERLAN.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12151'&gt;arXiv:2501.12151&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 21 Jan 2025 14:01:39 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Reply to comment on "Controlled bond expansion for Density Matrix Renormalization Group ground state search at single-site costs"</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12291</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Andreas Gleis, Jheng-Wei Li, Jan von Delft&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We reply to McCulloch and Osborne's recent comment on our manuscript (Phys. Rev. Lett. 130, 246402 (2023)) on controlled bond expansion (CBE) for density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) ground state search. We appreciate their suggestion to consider randomized SVD and address their constructive critique on the variational properties of CBE-DMRG. However, we strongly disagree with their proposal to omit the projection to the 2-site tangent space and explain its importance for efficient bond expansion. In particular, in the context of CBE applied to the time-dependent variational principle (TDVP), we show that omitting this projection can lead to avoidable errors. Lastly, we emphasize the complementary roles of 3S mixing and CBE, reiterating our recommendation from Phys. Rev. Lett. 130, 246402 (2023) to combine both methods (CBE+$\alpha$). We provide examples to demonstrate the superior efficiency and robustness of CBE+$\alpha$.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12291'&gt;arXiv:2501.12291&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 21 Jan 2025 17:00:15 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Quantum Compressive Sensing Meets Quantum Noise: A Practical Exploration</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12335</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Naveed Naimipour, Collin Frink, Harry Shaw, Haleh Safavi, Mojtaba Soltanalian&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Compressive sensing is a signal processing technique that enables the reconstruction of sparse signals from a limited number of measurements, leveraging the signal's inherent sparsity to facilitate efficient recovery. Recent works on the Quantum Compressive Sensing (QCS) architecture, a quantum data-driven approach to compressive sensing where the state of the tensor network is represented by a quantum state over a set of entangled qubits, have shown promise in advancing quantum data-driven methods for compressive sensing. However, the QCS framework has remained largely untested on quantum computing resources or in the presence of quantum noise. In this work, we present a practical implementation of QCS on Amazon Braket, utilizing the Quantum Imaginary Time Evolution (QITE) projection technique to assess the framework's capabilities under quantum noise. We outline the necessary modifications to the QCS framework for deployment on Amazon Braket, followed by results under four types of quantum noise. Finally, we discuss potential long-term directions aimed at unlocking the full potential of quantum compressive sensing for applications such as signal recovery and image processing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12335'&gt;arXiv:2501.12335&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 21 Jan 2025 18:10:03 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>A Faster Quantum Fourier Transform</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Ronit Shah&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We present an asymptotically improved algorithm for implementing the Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) in both the exact and approximate settings. Historically, the approximate QFT has been implemented in $\Theta(n \log n)$ gates, and the exact in $\Theta(n^2)$ gates. In this work, we show that these costs can be reduced by leveraging a novel formulation of the QFT that recurses on two partitions of the qubits. Specifically, our approach yields an $\Theta(n(\log \log n)^2)$ algorithm for the approximate QFT using $\Theta(\log n)$ ancillas, and an $\Theta(n(\log n)^2)$ algorithm for the exact QFT requiring $\Theta(n)$ ancillas.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12414'&gt;arXiv:2501.12414&lt;/a&gt;] Published Sun, 19 Jan 2025 06:18:52 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Entanglement asymmetry dynamics in random quantum circuits</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12459</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Filiberto Ares, Sara Murciano, Pasquale Calabrese, Lorenzo Piroli&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We study the dynamics of entanglement asymmetry in random unitary circuits (RUCs). Focusing on a local $U(1)$ charge, we consider symmetric initial states evolved by both local one-dimensional circuits and geometrically non-local RUCs made of two-qudit gates. We compute the entanglement asymmetry of subsystems of arbitrary size, analyzing the relaxation time scales. We show that the entanglement asymmetry of the whole system approaches its stationary value in a time independent of the system size for both local and non-local circuits. For subsystems, we find qualitative differences depending on their size. When the subsystem is larger than half of the full system, the equilibration time scales are again independent of the system size for both local and non-local circuits and the entanglement asymmetry grows monotonically in time. Conversely, when the subsystems are smaller than half of the full system, we show that the entanglement asymmetry is non-monotonic in time and that it equilibrates in a time proportional to the quantum-information scrambling time, providing a physical intuition. As a consequence, the subsystem-equilibration time depends on the locality of interactions, scaling linearly and logarithmically in the system size, respectively, for local and non-local RUCs. Our work confirms the entanglement asymmetry as a versatile and computable probe of symmetry in many-body physics and yields a phenomenological overview of entanglement-asymmetry evolution in typical non-integrable dynamics.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12459'&gt;arXiv:2501.12459&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 21 Jan 2025 19:06:43 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Classical and quantum algorithms for characters of the symmetric group</title>

However, computing characters of some groups such as the symmetric group $S_n$ is a challenging problem known to be $\#P$-hard in the worst case. Here we describe a Matrix Product State (MPS) algorithm for characters of $S_n$. The algorithm computes an MPS encoding all irreducible characters of a given permutation. It relies on a mapping from characters of $S_n$ to quantum spin chains proposed by Crichigno and Prakash. We also provide a simpler derivation of this mapping. We complement this result by presenting a $poly(n)$ size quantum circuit that prepares the corresponding MPS, obtaining an efficient quantum algorithm for certain sampling problems based on characters of $S_n$. To assess classical hardness of these problems we present a general reduction from strong simulation (computing a given probability) to weak simulation (sampling with a small error). This reduction applies to any sampling problem with a certain granularity structure and may be of independent interest.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12579'&gt;arXiv:2501.12579&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 22 Jan 2025 01:55:28 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Tensor cross interpolation approach for quantum impurity problems based on the weak-coupling expansion</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12643</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Shuta Matsuura, Hiroshi Shinaoka, Philipp Werner, Naoto Tsuji&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We apply the tensor cross interpolation (TCI) algorithm to solve equilibrium quantum impurity problems with high precision based on the weak-coupling expansion. The TCI algorithm, a kind of active learning method, factorizes high-dimensional integrals that appear in the perturbative expansion into a product of low-dimensional ones, enabling us to evaluate higher-order terms efficiently. This method is free from the sign problem which quantum Monte Carlo methods sometimes suffer from, and allows one to directly calculate the free energy. We benchmark the TCI impurity solver on an exactly solvable impurity model, and find good agreement with the exact solutions. We also incorporate the TCI impurity solver into the dynamical mean-field theory to solve the Hubbard model, and show that the metal-to-Mott insulator transition is correctly described with comparable accuracy to the Monte Carlo methods. Behind the effectiveness of the TCI approach for quantum impurity problems lies the fact that the integrands in the weak-coupling expansion naturally have a low-rank structure in the tensor-train representation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12643'&gt;arXiv:2501.12643&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 22 Jan 2025 05:07:08 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Bound states and deconfined spinons in the dynamical structure factor of the $J_1 - J_2$ spin-1 chain</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13059</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Aman Sharma, Mithilesh Nayak, Henrik M. Rønnow, Frédéric Mila&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Using a time-dependent density matrix renormalization group approach, we study the dynamical structure factor of the $J_1 - J_2$ spin-1 chain. As $J_2$ increases, the magnon mode develops incommensurability. The system undergoes a first-order transition at $J_2 = 0.76 J_1$, and at that point, domain walls lead to a continuum of fractional quasi-particles or spinons. By studying small variations in $J_2$ around the transition point, we observe the confinement of spinons into bound states in the spectral function and find a smooth evolution of the spectrum into magnon modes away from the phase transition. We employ the single-mode approximation to accurately account for the dispersion of the magnon mode away from the phase transition and describe the associated continua and bound states. We extend the single-mode approximation to describe the dispersion of a spinon at the phase transition point and obtain its dispersion throughout the Brillouin zone. This allows us to relate the incommensurability at and around the transition point to the competition between a negative nearest-neighbour hopping amplitude and a positive next-nearest-neighbour one for the domain wall.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13059'&gt;arXiv:2501.13059&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 22 Jan 2025 18:11:32 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Random Quantum Circuits with Time-Reversal Symmetry</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13161</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Kabir Khanna, Abhishek Kumar, Romain Vasseur, Andreas W. W. Ludwig&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Time-reversal (TR) symmetry is crucial for understanding a wide range of physical phenomena, and plays a key role in constraining fundamental particle interactions and in classifying phases of quantum matter. In this work, we introduce an ensemble of random quantum circuits that are representative of the dynamics of generic TR-invariant many-body quantum systems. We derive a general statistical mechanics model describing entanglement, many-body quantum chaos and quantum information dynamics in such TR-invariant circuits. As an example of application of our formalism, we study the universal properties of measurement-induced phase transitions (MIPT) in monitored TR-invariant systems, with measurements performed in a TR-invariant basis. We find that TR-invariance of the unitary part of the dynamics does not affect the universality class, unless measurement outcomes are post-selected to satisfy the global TR-invariance of each quantum trajectory. We confirm these predictions numerically, and find, for both generic and Clifford-based evolutions, novel critical exponents in the case of ``strong'', i.e. global TR-invariance where each quantum trajectory is TR-invariant.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13161'&gt;arXiv:2501.13161&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 22 Jan 2025 19:00:07 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Non-zero noise extrapolation: accurately simulating noisy quantum circuits with tensor networks</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13237</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Anthony P. Thompson, Arie Soeteman, Chris Cade, Ido Niesen&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Understanding the effects of noise on quantum computations is fundamental to the development of quantum hardware and quantum algorithms. Simulation tools are essential for quantitatively modelling these effects, yet unless artificial restrictions are placed on the circuit or noise model, accurately modelling noisy quantum computations is an extremely challenging task due to unfavourable scaling of required computational resources. Tensor network methods offer a viable solution for simulating computations that generate limited entanglement or that have noise models which yield low gate fidelities. However, in the most interesting regime of entangling circuits (with high gate fidelities) relevant for error correction and mitigation tensor network simulations often achieve poor accuracy. In this work we develop and numerically test a method for significantly improving the accuracy of tensor network simulations of noisy quantum circuits in the low-noise (i.e. high gate-fidelity) regime. Our method comes with the advantages that it (i) allows for the simulation of quantum circuits under generic types of noise model, (ii) is especially tailored to the low-noise regime, and (iii) retains the benefits of tensor network scaling, enabling efficient simulations of large numbers of qubits. We build upon the observations that adding extra noise to a quantum circuit makes it easier to simulate with tensor networks, and that the results can later be reliably extrapolated back to the low-noise regime of interest. These observations form the basis for a novel emulation technique that we call non-zero noise extrapolation, in analogy to the quantum error mitigation technique of zero-noise extrapolation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13237'&gt;arXiv:2501.13237&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 22 Jan 2025 21:42:24 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Fast and Provable Tensor-Train Format Tensor Completion via Precondtioned Riemannian Gradient Descent</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13385</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Fengmiao Bian, Jian-Feng Cai, Xiaoqun Zhang, Yuanwei Zhang&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Low-rank tensor completion aims to recover a tensor from partially observed entries, and it is widely applicable in fields such as quantum computing and image processing. Due to the significant advantages of the tensor train (TT) format in handling structured high-order tensors, this paper investigates the low-rank tensor completion problem based on the TT-format. We proposed a preconditioned Riemannian gradient descent algorithm (PRGD) to solve low TT-rank tensor completion and establish its linear convergence. Experimental results on both simulated and real datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the PRGD algorithm. On the simulated dataset, the PRGD algorithm reduced the computation time by two orders of magnitude compared to existing classical algorithms. In practical applications such as hyperspectral image completion and quantum state tomography, the PRGD algorithm significantly reduced the number of iterations, thereby substantially reducing the computational time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13385'&gt;arXiv:2501.13385&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 23 Jan 2025 05:03:50 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Meson thermalization with a hot medium in the open Schwinger model</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13675</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Takis Angelides, Yibin Guo, Karl Jansen, Stefan Kühn, Giuseppe Magnifico&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Quantum field theories treated as open quantum systems provide a crucial framework for studying realistic experimental scenarios, such as quarkonia traversing the quark-gluon plasma produced at the Large Hadron Collider. In such cases, capturing the complex thermalization process requires a detailed understanding of how particles evolve and interact with a hot medium. Considering the open lattice Schwinger model and using tensor network algorithms, we investigate the thermalization dynamics of mesonic particles in a hot medium, such as the Schwinger boson or the electric flux string. We simulate systems with up to 100 lattice sites, achieving accurate preservation of the electric field parity symmetry, demonstrating the algorithm's robustness and scalability. Our results reveal that the thermalization time increases with stronger dissipation from the environment, increasing environment temperature, higher background electric field and heavier fermion masses. Further, we study the quantum mutual information between the two halves of the flux string connecting a meson's constituent particles and analyze its relation to relevant dynamical observables.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13675'&gt;arXiv:2501.13675&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 23 Jan 2025 13:57:20 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>A Classifying Space for Phases of Matrix Product States</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14241</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Agnes Beaudry, Michael Hermele, Markus J. Pflaum, Marvin Qi, Daniel D. Spiegel, David T. Stephen&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We construct a topological space $\mathcal{B}$ consisting of translation invariant injective matrix product states (MPS) of all physical and bond dimensions and show that it has the weak homotopy type $K(\mathbb{Z}, 2) \times K(\mathbb{Z}, 3)$. The implication is that the phase of a family of such states parametrized by a space $X$ is completely determined by two invariants: a class in $H^2(X; \mathbb{Z})$ corresponding to the Chern number per unit cell and a class in $H^3(X; \mathbb{Z})$, the so-called Kapustin-Spodyneiko (KS) number. The space $\mathcal{B}$ is defined as the quotient of a contractible space $\mathcal{E}$ of MPS tensors by an equivalence relation describing gauge transformations of the tensors. We prove that the projection map $p:\mathcal{E} \rightarrow \mathcal{B}$ is a quasifibration, and this allows us to determine the weak homotopy type of $\mathcal{B}$. As an example, we review the Chern number pump-a family of MPS parametrized by $S^3$-and prove that it generates $\pi_3(\mathcal{B})$.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14241'&gt;arXiv:2501.14241&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 24 Jan 2025 04:58:32 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

Thanks to the Grassmann tensor network formulation, there is no difficulty in dealing with the massive staggered fermions. We study the $\theta$ dependence of the free energy in the thermodynamic limit. Our calculation provides consistent results with the analytical solution in the large mass limit. The results also suggest that the $N_f=2$ Schwinger model on a lattice has a different phase structure from that described by the continuum theory.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14086'&gt;arXiv:2501.14086&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 23 Jan 2025 20:46:11 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Atis Yosprakob&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The tensor renormalization group is a promising complementary approach to traditional Monte Carlo methods for lattice systems, as it is inherently free from the sign problem. We discuss recent developments crucial for its application to lattice QCD: the multi-layer construction for multi-flavor gauge theory and the armillary sphere formulation for non-Abelian gauge theory. These techniques are important for reducing the size of the initial tensor and for eliminating non-local entanglement structures within the tensor network.

      <title>Bipartite Fluctuations and Charge Fractionalization in Quantum Wires</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Magali Korolev, Karyn Le Hur&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We introduce a quantum information method for measuring fractional charges in ballistic quantum wires generalizing bipartite fluctuations to the chiral quasiparticles in Luttinger liquids, i.e. adding charge and current fluctuations in a region of the wire. Bipartite fluctuations at equilibrium are characterized through a logarithmic scaling with distance encoding the entangled nature of these fractional charges in one-dimensional (1D) fluids. This approach clarifies the physical meaning of the dephasing factor of electronic interferences in a ballistic ring geometry at zero temperature, as a result of charge fractionalization. We formulate an analogy towards ground-state energetics. We show how bipartite current fluctuations represent a useful tool to locate quantum phase transitions associated to Mott physics. We address a spin chain equivalence and verify the fractional charges through an algorithm such as Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG). Adding a potential difference between the two sides (parties) of the wire, bipartite fluctuations can detect a bound state localized at the interface through the Jackiw-Rebbi model coexisting with fractional charges.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14410'&gt;arXiv:2501.14410&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 24 Jan 2025 11:22:21 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Dualities between 2+1d fusion surface models from braided fusion categories</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14722</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Luisa Eck&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Fusion surface models generalize the concept of anyon chains to 2+1 dimensions, utilizing fusion 2-categories as their input. We investigate bond-algebraic dualities in these systems and show that distinct module tensor categories $\mathcal{M}$ over the same braided fusion category $\mathcal{B}$ give rise to dual lattice models. This extends the 1+1d result that dualities in anyon chains are classified by module categories over fusion categories. We analyze two concrete examples: (i) a $\text{Rep}(S_3)$ model with a constrained Hilbert space, dual to the spin-$\tfrac{1}{2}$ XXZ model on the honeycomb lattice, and (ii) a bilayer Kitaev honeycomb model, dual to a spin-$\tfrac{1}{2}$ model with XXZ and Ising interactions. Unlike regular $\mathcal{M}=\mathcal{B}$ fusion surface models, which conserve only 1-form symmetries, models constructed from $\mathcal{M} \neq \mathcal{B}$ can exhibit both 1-form and 0-form symmetries, including non-invertible ones.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14722'&gt;arXiv:2501.14722&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 24 Jan 2025 18:58:02 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

The standard Monte Carlo simulation for this model is hindered not only by the complex action problem due to the topological term but also by the topological freezing problem originating from the admissibility condition. Resolving both obstacles simultaneously with the tensor renormalization group approach, we show the advantage of the admissibility condition in dealing with the topological term discretized with the so-called field-theoretical definition.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15352'&gt;arXiv:2501.15352&lt;/a&gt;] Published Sun, 26 Jan 2025 00:01:36 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

The Z2 Bose-Hubbard model has been proposed to describe ultracold bosons in a dynamical optical lattice. This model introduces the lattice degrees of freedom by placing half-spins on the bonds between neighboring lattice sites. In this study, we investigate the effect of spin fluctuations on the ground state by using the density-matrix renormalization group method. By calculating the spin structure factor and the compressibility, we show that there is a phase transition between two spatially nonuniform states. We also discuss the ground state in the strong transverse magnetic field.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15490'&gt;arXiv:2501.15490&lt;/a&gt;] Published Sun, 26 Jan 2025 11:35:45 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Improving accuracy of tree-tensor network approach by optimization of network structure</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15514</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Toshiya Hikihara, Hiroshi Ueda, Kouichi Okunishi, Kenji Harada, Tomotoshi Nishino&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Numerical methods based on tensor networks have been extensively explored in the research of quantum many-body systems in recent years. It has been recognized that the ability of tensor networks to describe a quantum many-body state crucially depends on the spatial structure of the network. In the previous work, we proposed an algorithm based on tree tensor networks (TTNs) that automatically optimizes the structure of TTN according to the spatial profile of entanglement in the state of interest. In this paper, we precisely analyze how detailed updating schemes in the structural optimization algorithm affect its computational accuracy for the random XY-exchange model under random magnetic fields and the Richardson model. We then find that for the random XY model, on the one hand, the algorithm achieves improved accuracy, and the stochastic algorithm, which selects the local network structure probabilistically, is notably effective. For the Richardson model, on the other hand, the resulting numerical accuracy subtly depends on the initial TTN and the updating schemes. In particular, the algorithm without the stochastic updating scheme certainly improves the accuracy, while the one with the stochastic updates results in poor accuracy due to the effect of randomizing the network structure at the early stage of the calculation. These results indicate that the algorithm successfully improves the accuracy of the numerical calculations for quantum many-body states, while it is essential to appropriately choose the updating scheme as well as the initial TTN structure, depending on the systems treated.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15514'&gt;arXiv:2501.15514&lt;/a&gt;] Published Sun, 26 Jan 2025 13:11:30 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Harnessing CUDA-Q's MPS for Tensor Network Simulations of Large-Scale Quantum Circuits</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Gabin Schieffer, Stefano Markidis, Ivy Peng&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Quantum computer simulators are an indispensable tool for prototyping quantum algorithms and verifying the functioning of existing quantum computer hardware. The current largest quantum computers feature more than one thousand qubits, challenging their classical simulators. State-vector quantum simulators are challenged by the exponential increase of representable quantum states with respect to the number of qubits, making more than fifty qubits practically unfeasible. A more appealing approach for simulating quantum computers is adopting the tensor network approach, whose memory requirements fundamentally depend on the level of entanglement in the quantum circuit, and allows simulating the current largest quantum computers. This work investigates and evaluates the CUDA-Q tensor network simulators on an Nvidia Grace Hopper system, particularly the Matrix Product State (MPS) formulation. We compare the performance of the CUDA-Q state vector implementation and validate the correctness of MPS simulations. Our results highlight that tensor network-based methods provide a significant opportunity to simulate large-qubit circuits, albeit approximately. We also show that current GPU-accelerated computation cannot fully utilize GPU efficiently in the case of MPS simulations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15939'&gt;arXiv:2501.15939&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 27 Jan 2025 10:36:05 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

We consider iron in aluminum nitride, a material of interest for hybrid quantum technologies, and we carry out calculations with quantum embedding methods -- density matrix embedding theory (DMET) and quantum defect embedding theory (QDET) and with spin-flip time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT). We show that both DMET and QDET accurately describe the ground state and low-lying excited states of the defect, and that TDDFT yields photoluminescence spectra in agreement with experiments. In addition, we provide a detailed discussion of the convergence of our results as a function of the active space used in the embedding methods, thus defining a protocol to obtain converged data, directly comparable with experiments.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16280'&gt;arXiv:2501.16280&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 27 Jan 2025 18:15:35 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Twisted gauging and topological sectors in (2+1)d abelian lattice gauge theories</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16301</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Bram Vancraeynest-De Cuiper, Clement Delcamp&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Given a two-dimensional quantum lattice model with an abelian gauge theory interpretation, we investigate a duality operation that amounts to gauging its invertible 1-form symmetry, followed by gauging the resulting 0-form symmetry in a twisted way via a choice of discrete torsion. Using tensor networks, we introduce explicit lattice realisations of the so-called condensation defects, which are obtained by gauging the 1-form symmetry along submanifolds of spacetime, and employ the same calculus to realise the duality operators. By leveraging these tensor network operators, we compute the non-trivial interplay between symmetry-twisted boundary conditions and charge sectors under the duality operation, enabling us to construct isometries relating the dual Hamiltonians. Whenever a lattice gauge theory is left invariant under the duality operation, we explore the possibility of promoting the self-duality to an internal symmetry. We argue that this results in a symmetry structure that encodes the 2-representations of a 2-group.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16301'&gt;arXiv:2501.16301&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 27 Jan 2025 18:39:10 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Two Channel Kondo behavior in the quantum XX chain with a boundary defect</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16415</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Yicheng Tang, Pradip Kattel, J. H. Pixley, Natan Andrei&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We demonstrate that a boundary defect in the single spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ quantum $XX$ chain exhibits two-channel Kondo physics. Due to the presence of the defect, the edge spin fractionalizes into two Majorana fermions, out of which one decouples, and one is overscreened by the free fermion in bulk, leading to non-trivial boundary behavior characteristic of the two-channel Kondo model. When the ratio of boundary to bulk coupling exceeds a critical value of $\sqrt{2}$, a massive boundary-bound mode is exponentially localized near the impurity site for strong impurity coupling. This leads to unusual behavior in physical quantities, such as the $g$-function not being monotonic. We compute the $g-$function of the impurity from both thermodynamic and entanglement entropy calculations and show that it takes a non-integer value of $\sqrt{2}$ just as in the two-channel Kondo problem.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16415'&gt;arXiv:2501.16415&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 27 Jan 2025 19:00:00 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

The intersection property ensures that the ground space consists of MPS, with degeneracy bounded by the square of the bond dimension. The new local property, dubbed stability, generalizes (block) injectivity and is satisfied by the MPS tensors that construct the W state, domain wall superposition states, and their generalizations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17109'&gt;arXiv:2501.17109&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 28 Jan 2025 17:55:48 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Approximation of High-Dimensional Gibbs Distributions with Functional Hierarchical Tensors</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17143</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Nan Sheng, Xun Tang, Haoxuan Chen, Lexing Ying&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The numerical representation of high-dimensional Gibbs distributions is challenging due to the curse of dimensionality manifesting through the intractable normalization constant calculations. This work addresses this challenge by performing a particle-based high-dimensional parametric density estimation subroutine, and the input to the subroutine is Gibbs samples generated by leveraging advanced sampling techniques. Specifically, to generate Gibbs samples, we employ ensemble-based annealed importance sampling, a population-based approach for sampling multimodal distributions. These samples are then processed using functional hierarchical tensor sketching, a tensor-network-based density estimation method for high-dimensional distributions, to obtain the numerical representation of the Gibbs distribution. We successfully apply the proposed approach to complex Ginzburg-Landau models with hundreds of variables. In particular, we show that the approach proposed is successful at addressing the metastability issue under difficult numerical cases.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17143'&gt;arXiv:2501.17143&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 28 Jan 2025 18:44:20 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Linear-time classical approximate optimization of rugged-energy-landscape cubic-lattice classical spin glasses</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17267</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Adil A. Gangat&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Rugged energy landscapes present computational difficulty for optimization. A quantum alleviation may be possible via tunneling. Classically, an alleviation may arise through optimizing over subsystems and concatenating the results, but this introduces error in the optimization of the full problem and thereby raises the question of whether such an approach actually has a scaling advantage over approximately optimizing the full system directly to the same error. Here we investigate this question in the setting of cubic-lattice classical Ising spin glasses, where recent theoretical and experimental developments open the possibility of showing quantum speedup with quantum annealing, and where classical time-complexity results remain absent. For the subsystem-based approach we introduce a very simple deterministic tensor-network heuristic that features linear time and space complexity for approximate optimization of the full problem. For the full-system approach we use simulated annealing and parallel tempering. For the most rugged instances generated with tile planting on system sizes up to 56$\times$56$\times$56, we find that full-system simulated annealing and full-system parallel tempering display a slightly superlinear time complexity when targeting the same energy error achieved by the subsystem-based linear-time heuristic. We also find that the error of the latter heuristic monotonically decreases with increasing ruggedness over the higher end of the ruggedness spectrum. These results suggest that subsystem-based classical optimization heuristics should be taken into account when seeking to demonstrate quantum speedup on rugged energy landscapes. We discuss prospects for reducing the error of our heuristic, for adapting our heuristic to arbitrary graphs, and for low-power, accelerated implementations with photonic matrix-multiplication hardware.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17267'&gt;arXiv:2501.17267&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 28 Jan 2025 19:52:59 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>System-environmental entanglement in critical spin systems under $ZZ$-decoherence and its relation to strong and weak symmetries</title>

In particular, system-environmental entanglement is one of quantities to characterize mixed state properties under decoherence. In this study, we investigate the behavior of the system-environmental entanglement for critical spin chains under nearest-neighbor $ZZ$ -decoherence. We numerically find that the system-environmental entanglement exhibits a specific scaling law including a system-independent universal term ("$g$-function"). For the critical XXZ model, transition to strong-to-weak spontaneously symmetry breaking mixed state takes place. In that case, the $g$-function changes its value at decoherent transition point and gets double the value of system under single-site $Z$-decoherence, which was recently studied by conformal field theory. By studying Shannon entropy, we clarify origin of this $g$-function behavior.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17481'&gt;arXiv:2501.17481&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 29 Jan 2025 08:45:46 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Large-scale stochastic simulation of open quantum systems</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Aaron Sander, Maximilian Fröhlich, Martin Eigel, Jens Eisert, Patrick Gelß, Michael Hintermüller, Richard M. Milbradt, Robert Wille, Christian B. Mendl&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Understanding the precise interaction mechanisms between quantum systems and their environment is crucial for advancing stable quantum technologies, designing reliable experimental frameworks, and building accurate models of real-world phenomena. However, simulating open quantum systems, which feature complex non-unitary dynamics, poses significant computational challenges that require innovative methods to overcome. In this work, we introduce the tensor jump method (TJM), a scalable, embarrassingly parallel algorithm for stochastically simulating large-scale open quantum systems, specifically Markovian dynamics captured by Lindbladians. This method is built on three core principles where, in particular, we extend the Monte Carlo wave function (MCWF) method to matrix product states, use a dynamic time-dependent variational principle (TDVP) to significantly reduce errors during time evolution, and introduce what we call a sampling MPS to drastically reduce the dependence on the simulation's time step size. We demonstrate that this method scales more effectively than previous methods and ensures convergence to the Lindbladian solution independent of system size, which we show both rigorously and numerically. Finally, we provide evidence of its utility by simulating Lindbladian dynamics of XXX Heisenberg models up to a thousand spins using a consumer-grade CPU. This work represents a significant step forward in the simulation of large-scale open quantum systems, with the potential to enable discoveries across various domains of quantum physics, particularly those where the environment plays a fundamental role, and to both dequantize and facilitate the development of more stable quantum hardware.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17913'&gt;arXiv:2501.17913&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 29 Jan 2025 19:00:00 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>String Breaking in a $2+1$D $\mathbb{Z}_2$ Lattice Gauge Theory</title>

Halimeh&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; String breaking is an intriguing phenomenon crucial to the understanding of lattice gauge theories (LGTs), with strong relevance to both condensed matter and high-energy physics (HEP). Recent experiments investigating string breaking in $2+1$D (two spatial and one temporal dimensions) LGTs motivate a thorough analysis of its underlying mechanisms. Here, we perform matrix product state (MPS) simulations of string breaking in an experimentally relevant $2+1$D $\mathbb{Z}_2$ LGT in the presence of two external charges. We provide a detailed description of the system in the confined phase, highlight a number of mechanisms which are responsible for string breaking, and argue that magnetic fluctuations have a stabilizing effect on the strings. Moreover, we show that deep in the confined regime the problem is dual to one-dimensional free fermions hopping on an open chain. Our work elucidates the microscopic processes of string breaking in $2+1$D LGTs, and our findings can be probed on current superconducting-qubit quantum computers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17929'&gt;arXiv:2501.17929&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 29 Jan 2025 19:00:04 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Realization of Two-dimensional Discrete Time Crystals with Anisotropic Heisenberg Coupling</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18036</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Eric D. Switzer, Niall Robertson, Nathan Keenan, Ángel Rodríguez, Andrea D'Urbano, Bibek Pokharel, Talat S. Rahman, Oles Shtanko, Sergiy Zhuk, Nicolás Lorente&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; A discrete time crystal (DTC) is the paradigmatic example of a phase of matter that occurs exclusively in systems out of equilibrium. This phenomenon is characterized by the spontaneous symmetry breaking of discrete time-translation and provides a rich playground to study a fundamental question in statistical physics: what mechanism allows for driven quantum systems to exhibit emergent behavior that deviates from their counterparts with time-independent evolution? Unlike equilibrium phases, DTCs exhibit macroscopic manifestations of coherent quantum dynamics, challenging the conventional narrative that thermodynamic behavior universally erases quantum signatures. However, due to the difficulty of simulating these systems with either classical or quantum computers, previous studies have been limited to a set of models with Ising-like couplings -- and mostly only in one dimension -- thus precluding our understanding of the existence (or not) of DTCs in models with interactions that closely align with what occurs in nature. In this work, by combining the latest generation of IBM quantum processors with state-of-the-art tensor network methods, we are able to demonstrate the existence of a DTC in a two-dimensional system governed by anisotropic Heisenberg interactions. Our comprehensive analysis reveals a rich phase diagram encompassing spin-glass, ergodic, and time-crystalline phases, highlighting the tunability of these phases through multiple control parameters. Crucially, our results emphasize the interplay of initialization, interaction anisotropy, and driving protocols in stabilizing the DTC phase. By extending the study of Floquet matter beyond simplified models, we lay the groundwork for exploring how driven systems bridge the gap between quantum coherence and emergent non-equilibrium thermodynamics.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18036'&gt;arXiv:2501.18036&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 29 Jan 2025 22:51:09 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

Pollmann&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Out-of-equilibrium phases in many-body systems constitute a new paradigm in quantum matter - they exhibit dynamical properties that may otherwise be forbidden by equilibrium thermodynamics. Among these non-equilibrium phases are periodically driven (Floquet) systems [1-5], that are generically difficult to simulate classically due to their high entanglement. Using an array of superconducting qubits, we realize a Floquet topologically ordered state theoretically proposed in Ref. [6], image the characteristic dynamics of its chiral edge modes, and characterize its emergent anyonic excitations. Devising an interferometric algorithm allows us to introduce and measure a bulk topological invariant to probe the dynamical transmutation of anyons for system sizes up to 58 qubits. Our work demonstrates that quantum processors can provide key insights into the thus-far largely unexplored landscape of highly entangled non-equilibrium phases of matter.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18461'&gt;arXiv:2501.18461&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 30 Jan 2025 16:25:33 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Bridging Entanglement and Magic Resources through Operator Space</title>

White&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Local operator entanglement (LOE) dictates the complexity of simulating Heisenberg evolution using tensor network methods, and serves as strong dynamical signature of quantum chaos. We show that LOE is also sensitive to how non-Clifford a unitary is: its magic resources. In particular, we prove that LOE is always upper-bound by three distinct magic monotones: $T$-count, unitary nullity, and operator stabilizer R\'enyi entropy. Moreover, in the average case for large, random circuits, LOE and magic monotones approximately coincide. Our results imply that an operator evolution that is expensive to simulate using tensor network methods must also be inefficient using both stabilizer and Pauli truncation methods. A direct corollary of our bounds is that any quantum chaotic dynamics cannot be simulated classically. Entanglement in operator space therefore measures a unified picture of non-classical resources, in stark contrast to the Schr\"odinger picture.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18679'&gt;arXiv:2501.18679&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 30 Jan 2025 19:00:00 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Quantum Phase Transitions between Symmetry-Enriched Fracton Phases</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Julian Boesl, Yu-Jie Liu, Wen-Tao Xu, Frank Pollmann, Michael Knap&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Topologically ordered phases exhibit further complexity in the presence of global symmetries: Their anyonic excitations may exhibit different transformation patterns under these symmetries, leading to a classification in terms of symmetry-enriched topological orders. We develop a generic scheme to study an analogous situation for three-dimensional fracton phases by means of isometric tensor network states (isoTNS) with finite bond dimension, which allow us to tune phase transitions between different symmetry fractionalization patterns. We focus on the X-Cube model, a paradigmatic fracton model hosting two types of excitations: lineons, which are mobile in a single direction only, and fractons that are immobile on their own. By deforming the local tensors of the fixed point ground state, we find a family of exact wavefunctions for which the symmetry fractionalization under an anti-unitary symmetry on both types of excitations is directly visible. These wavefunctions are non-stabilizer states and have non-vanishing correlation lengths. They even exhibit power-law correlations at criticality between two symmetry-enriched topological orders. Furthermore, the isoTNS description allows for the explicit construction of a linear-depth quantum circuit to sequentially realize these exotic 3D states on a quantum processor, including a holographic scheme using only a pair of two-dimensional qubit arrays alongside measurements. Our approach provides a construction to enrich phases with exotic topological or fracton order and to study 3D quantum phase transition with exact wavefunctions, and offers a tractable route to implement and characterize fracton order on quantum devices.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18688'&gt;arXiv:2501.18688&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 30 Jan 2025 19:00:02 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Regularized second-order optimization of tensor-network Born machines</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18691</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Matan Ben-Dov, Jing Chen&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Tensor-network Born machines (TNBMs) are quantum-inspired generative models for learning data distributions. Using tensor-network contraction and optimization techniques, the model learns an efficient representation of the target distribution, capable of capturing complex correlations with a compact parameterization. Despite their promise, the optimization of TNBMs presents several challenges. A key bottleneck of TNBMs is the logarithmic nature of the loss function commonly used for this problem. The single-tensor logarithmic optimization problem cannot be solved analytically, necessitating an iterative approach that slows down convergence and increases the risk of getting trapped in one of many non-optimal local minima. In this paper, we present an improved second-order optimization technique for TNBM training, which significantly enhances convergence rates and the quality of the optimized model. Our method employs a modified Newton's method on the manifold of normalized states, incorporating regularization of the loss landscape to mitigate local minima issues. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by training a one-dimensional matrix product state (MPS) on both discrete and continuous datasets, showcasing its advantages in terms of stability and efficiency, and demonstrating its potential as a robust and scalable approach for optimizing quantum-inspired generative models.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18691'&gt;arXiv:2501.18691&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 30 Jan 2025 19:00:04 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Embedding of Tree Tensor Networks into Shallow Quantum Circuits</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18856</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Shota Sugawara, Kazuki Inomata, Tsuyoshi Okubo, Synge Todo&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) are being highlighted as key quantum algorithms for demonstrating quantum advantage on Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices, which are limited to executing shallow quantum circuits because of noise. However, the barren plateau problem, where the gradient of the loss function becomes exponentially small with system size, hinders this goal. Recent studies suggest that embedding tensor networks into quantum circuits and initializing the parameters can avoid the barren plateau. Yet, embedding tensor networks into quantum circuits is generally difficult, and methods have been limited to the simplest structure, Matrix Product States (MPSs). This study proposes a method to embed Tree Tensor Networks (TTNs), characterized by their hierarchical structure, into shallow quantum circuits. TTNs are suitable for representing two-dimensional systems and systems with long-range correlations, which MPSs are inadequate for representing. Our numerical results show that embedding TTNs provides better initial quantum circuits than MPS. Additionally, our method has a practical computational complexity, making it applicable to a wide range of TTNs. This study is expected to extend the application of VQAs to two-dimensional systems and those with long-range correlations, which have been challenging to utilize.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18856'&gt;arXiv:2501.18856&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 31 Jan 2025 02:38:17 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Kwok Ho Pai, Shinichiro Akiyama, Synge Todo&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The $(1+1)$-dimensional two-color lattice QCD is studied with the Grassmann tensor renormalization group. We construct tensor network representations of theories with the staggered fermion and the Wilson fermion and show that Grassmann tensor networks can describe both cases with the same bond dimension. We also propose an efficient initial tensor compression scheme to gauge degrees of freedom. We compute the number density, chiral condensate, and diquark condensate at finite density, employing the staggered fermions. For the theory with Wilson fermion, a critical point in the negative mass region is identified by inspecting the pseudoscalar condensate and the conformal field theory data.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18918'&gt;arXiv:2501.18918&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 31 Jan 2025 06:42:27 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Computing theta-dependent mass spectrum of the 2-flavor Schwinger model in the Hamiltonian formalism</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18960</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Akira Matsumoto, Etsuko Itou, Yuya Tanizaki&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We compute the $\theta$-dependent mass spectrum of the 2-flavor Schwingr model using the tensor network (DMRG) in the Hamiltonian formalism. The pion and the sigma meson are identified as stable particles of the model for nonzero $\theta$ whereas the eta meson becomes unstable. The meson masses are obtained from the one-point functions, using the meson operators defined by diagonalizing the correlation matrix to deal with the operator mixing. We also compute the dispersion relation directly by measuring the energy and momentum of the excited states, where the mesons are distinguished by the isospin quantum number. We confirmed that the meson masses computed by these methods agree with each other and are consistent with the calculation by the bosonized model. Our methods are free from the sign problem and show a significant improvement in accuracy compared to the conventional Monte Carlo methods. Furthermore, at the critical point $\theta = \pi$, the mesons become almost massless, and the one-point functions reproduce the expected CFT-like behavior.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18960'&gt;arXiv:2501.18960&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 31 Jan 2025 08:37:15 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>A Tensor-Train Decomposition based Compression of LLMs on Group Vector Systolic Accelerator</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19135</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Sixiao Huang, Tintin Wang, Ang Li, Ao Shen, Kai Li, Keyao Jiang, Mingqiang Huang, Hao Yu&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Large language models (LLMs) are both storage-intensive and computation-intensive, posing significant challenges when deployed on resource-constrained hardware. As linear layers in LLMs are mainly resource consuming parts, this paper develops a tensor-train decomposition (TTD) for LLMs with a further hardware implementation on FPGA. TTD compression is applied to the linear layers in ChatGLM3-6B and LLaMA2-7B models with compression ratios (CRs) for the whole network 1.94$\times$ and 1.60$\times$, respectively. The compressed LLMs are further implemented on FPGA hardware within a highly efficient group vector systolic array (GVSA) architecture, which has DSP-shared parallel vector PEs for TTD inference, as well as optimized data communication in the accelerator. Experimental results show that the corresponding TTD based LLM accelerator implemented on FPGA achieves 1.45$\times$ and 1.57$\times$ reduction in first token delay for ChatGLM3-6B and LLaMA2-7B models, respectively.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19135'&gt;arXiv:2501.19135&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 31 Jan 2025 13:45:31 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Grassmann tensor approach for two-dimensional QCD in the strong-coupling expansion</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19192</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Thomas Samberger, Jacques Bloch, Robert Lohmayer&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We present a tensor-network approach for the strong-coupling expansion of two-dimensional QCD with staggered quarks at non-zero chemical potential. After expanding the Boltzmann factor in the gauge and fermion actions, all gauge fields can be integrated out exactly and the partition function can be evaluated using the Grassmann higher-order tensor renormalization group approach. The method is modified to compute the $\mu$ dependence of the quark number density and the chiral condensate up to order $\beta^3$ with complete absence of higher-order terms infiltrating the result. Although the expansion itself is only a good approximation to the full theory at small $\beta&lt;0.1$, the range can be extended, by using judiciously chosen fits. Moreover, these fits also yield a valuable expansion in $\beta$ for the critical chemical potential.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19192'&gt;arXiv:2501.19192&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 31 Jan 2025 15:00:49 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>VeloxQ: A Fast and Efficient QUBO Solver</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; J. Pawłowski, J. Tuziemski, P. Tarasiuk, A. Przybysz, R. Adamski, K. Hendzel, Ł. Pawela, B. Gardas&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We introduce VeloxQ, a fast and efficient solver for Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problems, which are central to numerous real-world optimization tasks. Unlike other physics-inspired approaches to optimization problems, such as quantum annealing and quantum computing, VeloxQ does not require substantial progress of technology to unlock its full potential. We benchmark VeloxQ against the state-of-the-art QUBO solvers based on emerging technologies. Our comparison includes quantum annealers, specifically D-Wave's Advantage, and Advantage2 prototype platforms, the digital-quantum algorithm designed to solve Higher-Order Unconstrained Binary Optimization (HUBO) developed by Kipu Quantum, physics-inspired algorithms: Simulated Bifurcation and Parallel Annealing and an algorithm based on tropical tensor networks. We also take into account modern developments of conventional algorithms: Branch and Bound algorithm, an optimal implementation of the brute-force algorithm and BEIT QUBO solver. Our results show that VeloxQ not only matches but often surpasses the mentioned solvers in solution quality and runtime. Additionally, VeloxQ demonstrates excellent scalability being the only solver capable of solving large-scale optimization problems, including up to $2\times 10^{8}$ sparsely connected variables, that are currently intractable for its competitors. These findings position VeloxQ as a powerful and practical tool for tackling large-scale QUBO and HUBO problems, offering a compelling alternative to existing quantum and classical optimization methods.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19221'&gt;arXiv:2501.19221&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 31 Jan 2025 15:27:50 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Semi-group influence matrices for non-equilibrium quantum impurity models</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00109</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Michael Sonner, Valentin Link, Dmitry A. Abanin&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We introduce a framework for describing the real-time dynamics of quantum impurity models out of equilibrium which is based on the influence matrix approach. By replacing the dynamical map of a large fermionic quantum environment with an effective semi-group influence matrix (SGIM) which acts on a reduced auxiliary space, we overcome the limitations of previous proposals, achieving high accuracy at long evolution times. This SGIM corresponds to a uniform matrix-product state representation of the influence matrix and can be obtained by an efficient algorithm presented in this paper. We benchmark this approach by computing the spectral function of the single impurity Anderson model with high resolution. Further, the spectrum of the effective dynamical map allows us to obtain relaxation rates of the impurity towards equilibrium following a quantum quench. Finally, for a quantum impurity model with on-site two-fermion loss, we compute the spectral function and confirm the emergence of Kondo physics at large loss rates.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00109'&gt;arXiv:2502.00109&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 31 Jan 2025 19:00:42 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>A Simple and General Equation for Matrix Product Unitary Generation</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00390</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Sujeet K. Shukla&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Matrix Product Unitaries (MPUs) have emerged as essential tools for representing locality-preserving 1D unitary operators, with direct applications to quantum cellular automata and quantum phases of matter. A key challenge in the study of MPUs is determining when a given local tensor generates an MPU, a task previously addressed through fixed-point conditions and canonical forms, which can be cumbersome to evaluate for an arbitrary tensor. In this work, we establish a simple and efficient necessary and sufficient condition for a tensor $M$ to generate an MPU of size $N$, given by $\operatorname{Tr}(\mathbb{E}_M^N) = \operatorname{Tr}(\mathbb{E}_T^N) = 1$, where $\mathbb{E}_M$ and $\mathbb{E}_T$ are the transfer matrices of $M$ and $T = MM^\dagger$. This condition provides a unified framework for characterizing all uniform MPUs and significantly simplifies their evaluation. Furthermore, we show that locality preservation naturally arises when the MPU is generated for all system sizes. Our results offer new insights into the structure of MPUs, highlighting connections between unitary evolution, transfer matrices, and locality-preserving behavior, with potential extensions to higher-dimensions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00390'&gt;arXiv:2502.00390&lt;/a&gt;] Published Sat, 01 Feb 2025 10:26:45 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Generalized Lanczos method for systematic optimization of neural-network quantum states</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01264</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Jia-Qi Wang, Rong-Qiang He, Zhong-Yi Lu&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Recently, artificial intelligence for science has made significant inroads into various fields of natural science research. In the field of quantum many-body computation, researchers have developed numerous ground state solvers based on neural-network quantum states (NQSs), achieving ground state energies with accuracy comparable to or surpassing traditional methods such as variational Monte Carlo methods, density matrix renormalization group, and quantum Monte Carlo methods. Here, we combine supervised learning, reinforcement learning, and the Lanczos method to develop a systematic approach to improving the NQSs of many-body systems, which we refer to as the NQS Lanczos method. The algorithm mainly consists of two parts: the supervised learning part and the reinforcement learning part. Through supervised learning, the Lanczos states are represented by the NQSs. Through reinforcement learning, the NQSs are further optimized. We analyze the reasons for the underfitting problem and demonstrate how the NQS Lanczos method systematically improves the energy in the highly frustrated regime of the two-dimensional Heisenberg $J_1$-$J_2$ model. Compared to the existing method that combines the Lanczos method with the restricted Boltzmann machine, the primary advantage of the NQS Lanczos method is its linearly increasing computational cost.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01264'&gt;arXiv:2502.01264&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 03 Feb 2025 11:36:46 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>TT-LSQR For Tensor Least Squares Problems and Application to Data Mining *</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Lorenzo Piccinini, Valeria Simoncini&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We are interested in the numerical solution of the tensor least squares problem \[ \min_{\mathcal{X}} \| \mathcal{F} - \sum_{i =1}^{\ell} \mathcal{X} \times_1 A_1^{(i)} \times_2 A_2^{(i)} \cdots \times_d A_d^{(i)} \|_F, \] where $\mathcal{X}\in\mathbb{R}^{m_1 \times m_2 \times \cdots \times m_d}$, $\mathcal{F}\in\mathbb{R}^{n_1\times n_2 \times \cdots \times n_d}$ are tensors with $d$ dimensions, and the coefficients $A_j^{(i)}$ are tall matrices of conforming dimensions. We first describe a tensor implementation of the classical LSQR method by Paige and Saunders, using the tensor-train representation as key ingredient. We also show how to incorporate sketching to lower the computational cost of dealing with the tall matrices $A_j^{(i)}$. We then use this methodology to address a problem in information retrieval, the classification of a new query document among already categorized documents, according to given keywords.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01293'&gt;arXiv:2502.01293&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 03 Feb 2025 12:12:52 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Postselection-free experimental observation of the measurement-induced phase transition in circuits with universal gates</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01735</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Xiaozhou Feng, Jeremy Côté, Stefanos Kourtis, Brian Skinner&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Monitored many-body systems can exhibit a phase transition between entangling and disentangling dynamical phases by tuning the strength of measurements made on the system as it evolves. This phenomenon is called the measurement-induced phase transition (MIPT). Understanding the properties of the MIPT is a prominent challenge for both theory and experiment at the intersection of many-body physics and quantum information. Realizing the MIPT experimentally is particularly challenging due to the postselection problem, which demands a number of experimental realizations that grows exponentially with the number of measurements made during the dynamics. Proposed approaches that circumvent the postselection problem typically rely on a classical decoding process that infers the final state based on the measurement record. But the complexity of this classical process generally also grows exponentially with the system size unless the dynamics is restricted to a fine-tuned set of unitary operators. In this work we overcome these difficulties. We construct a tree-shaped quantum circuit whose nodes are Haar-random unitary operators followed by weak measurements of tunable strength. For these circuits, we show that the MIPT can be detected without postselection using only a simple classical decoding process whose complexity grows linearly with the number of qubits. Our protocol exploits the recursive structure of tree circuits, which also enables a complete theoretical description of the MIPT, including an exact solution for its critical point and scaling behavior. We experimentally realize the MIPT on Quantinuum's H1-1 trapped-ion quantum computer and show that the experimental results are precisely described by theory. Our results close the gap between analytical theory and postselection-free experimental observation of the MIPT.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01735'&gt;arXiv:2502.01735&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 03 Feb 2025 19:00:01 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Operator-basis Matrix Product State formalism for optical circuits</title>

Plenio&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Tensor network formalisms have emerged as powerful tools for simulating quantum state evolution. While widely applied in the study of optical quantum circuits, such as Boson Sampling, existing tensor network approaches fail to address the complexity mismatch between tensor contractions and the calculation of photon-counting probability amplitudes. Here, we present an alternative tensor network framework, the operator-basis Matrix Product State (MPS), which exploits the input-output relations of quantum optical circuits encoded in the unitary interferometer matrix. Our approach bridges the complexity gap by enabling the computation of the permanent -- central to Boson Sampling -- with the same computational complexity as the best known classical algorithm based on a graphical representation of the operator-basis MPS that we introduce. Furthermore, we exploit the flexibility of tensor networks to extend our formalism to incorporate partial distinguishability and photon loss, two key imperfections in practical interferometry experiments. This work offers a significant step forward in the simulation of large-scale quantum optical systems and the understanding of their computational complexity.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01737'&gt;arXiv:2502.01737&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 03 Feb 2025 19:00:02 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Clifford-Dressed Variational Principles for Precise Loschmidt Echoes</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01872</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Antonio Francesco Mello, Alessandro Santini, Mario Collura&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We extend the recently introduced Clifford dressed Time-Dependent Variational Principle (TDVP) to efficiently compute many-body wavefunction amplitudes in the computational basis. This advancement enhances the study of Loschmidt echoes, which generally require accurate calculations of the overlap between the evolved state and the initial wavefunction. By incorporating Clifford disentangling gates during TDVP evolution, our method effectively controls entanglement growth while keeping the computation of these amplitudes accessible. Specifically, it reduces the problem to evaluating the overlap between a Matrix Product State (MPS) and a stabilizer state, a task that remains computationally feasible within the proposed framework. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, we first benchmark it on the one-dimensional transverse-field Ising model. We then apply it to more challenging scenarios, including a non-integrable next-to-nearest-neighbor Ising chain and a two-dimensional Ising model. Our results highlight the versatility and efficiency of the Clifford-augmented MPS, showcasing its capability to go beyond the evaluation of simple expectation values. This makes it a powerful tool for exploring various aspects of many-body quantum dynamics.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01872'&gt;arXiv:2502.01872&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 03 Feb 2025 22:43:32 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Complex entanglement entropy for complex conformal field theory</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02001</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Haruki Shimizu, Kohei Kawabata&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Conformal field theory underlies critical ground states of quantum many-body systems. While conventional conformal field theory is associated with positive central charges, nonunitary conformal field theory with complex-valued central charges has recently been recognized as physically relevant. Here, we demonstrate that complex-valued entanglement entropy characterizes complex conformal field theory and critical phenomena of open quantum many-body systems. This is based on non-Hermitian reduced density matrices constructed from the combination of right and left ground states. Applying the density matrix renormalization group to non-Hermitian systems, we numerically calculate the complex entanglement entropy of the non-Hermitian five-state Potts model, thereby confirming the scaling behavior predicted by complex conformal field theory.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02001'&gt;arXiv:2502.02001&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 04 Feb 2025 04:27:11 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

The reduced density matrix of a Gibbs state can be represented as a $1 + 1$-dimensional tensor network, which is analogous to the tensor network representation of the partition function. The HOTRG method is used to approximate the reduced density matrix for arbitrary subsystem sizes, from which we obtain the entanglement entropy. We test our method in the quantum Ising model and obtain the entanglement entropy of the ground state by taking the size of time direction to infinity. The central charge $c$ is obtained as $c = 0.49997(8)$ for a bond dimension $D=96$, which agrees with the theoretical value $c=1/2$ within the error.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02030'&gt;arXiv:2502.02030&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 04 Feb 2025 05:40:11 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

In particular, the package employs the Projected Entangled-Pairs States to approximate the Boltzmann distribution corresponding to the model's cost function. This enables an efficient branch-and-bound search (within the probability space) that exploits the locality of the underlying problem's topology. As a result, our software enables the discovery of low-energy configurations for problems on quasi-2D graphs, particularly those relevant to modern quantum annealing devices. The modular architecture of SpinGlassPEPS$.$jl supports various contraction schemes and hardware acceleration.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02317'&gt;arXiv:2502.02317&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 04 Feb 2025 13:40:00 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Tensor Network Structure Search with Program Synthesis</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02711</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Zheng Guo, Aditya Deshpande, Brian Kiedrowski, Xinyu Wang, Alex Gorodetsky&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Tensor networks provide a powerful framework for compressing multi-dimensional data. The optimal tensor network structure for a given data tensor depends on both data characteristics and specific optimality criteria, making tensor network structure search a difficult problem. Existing solutions typically rely on sampling and compressing numerous candidate structures; these procedures are computationally expensive and therefore limiting for practical applications. We address this challenge by viewing tensor network structure search as a program synthesis problem and introducing an efficient constraint-based assessment method that avoids costly tensor decomposition. Specifically, we establish a correspondence between transformation programs and network structures. We also design a novel operation named output-directed splits to reduce the search space without hindering expressiveness. We then propose a synthesis algorithm to identify promising network candidates through constraint solving, and avoid tensor decomposition for all but the most promising candidates. Experimental results show that our approach improves search speed by up to $10\times$ and achieves compression ratios $1.5\times$ to $3\times$ better than state-of-the-art. Notably, our approach scales to larger tensors that are unattainable by prior work. Furthermore, the discovered topologies generalize well to similar data, yielding compression ratios up to $ 2.4\times$ better than a generic structure while the runtime remains around $110$ seconds.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02711'&gt;arXiv:2502.02711&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 04 Feb 2025 20:46:37 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Geoffrey L. Warner&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We develop a representation of an n-qubit register that parameterizes its statevector as a series of nested entanglements. We show that the recursive substructure of this representation provides a natural framework for automating the construction of quantum circuits for state preparation. It also allows for a straightforward treatment of pure state separability. We discuss a novel derivation of uniformly controlled rotations and the quantum Fourier transform within this representation, and consider the effects of single-qubit basis changes on its overall structure. We end with a discussion of the apparent connection between the compressibility of the state description in this representation, and the circuit complexity required to prepare it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02784'&gt;arXiv:2502.02784&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 05 Feb 2025 00:03:05 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Observation of slow relaxation due to Hilbert space fragmentation in strongly interacting Bose-Hubbard chains</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02959</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Kantaro Honda, Yosuke Takasu, Shimpei Goto, Hironori Kazuta, Masaya Kunimi, Ippei Danshita, Yoshiro Takahashi&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; While isolated quantum systems generally thermalize after long-time evolution, there are several exceptions defying thermalization. A notable mechanism of such nonergodicity is the Hilbert space fragmentation (HSF), where the Hamiltonian matrix splits into an exponentially large number of sectors due to the presence of nontrivial conserved quantities. Using ultracold gases, here we experimentally investigate the one-dimensional Bose-Hubbard system with neither disorder nor tilt potential, which has been predicted to exhibit HSF caused by a strong interatomic interaction. Specifically, we analyze far-from-equilibrium dynamics starting from a charge-density wave of doublons (atoms in doubly occupied sites) in a singlon and doublon-resolved manner to reveal a slowing-down of the relaxation in a strongly interacting regime. We find that the numbers of singlons and doublons are conserved during the dynamics, indicating HSF as a mechanism of the observed slow relaxation. Our results provide an experimental confirmation of the conserved quantities responsible for HSF.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02959'&gt;arXiv:2502.02959&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 05 Feb 2025 07:52:58 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>TensorQC: Towards Scalable Distributed Quantum Computing via Tensor Networks</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03445</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Wei Tang, Margaret Martonosi&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; A quantum processing unit (QPU) must contain a large number of high quality qubits to produce accurate results for problems at useful scales. In contrast, most scientific and industry classical computation workloads happen in parallel on distributed systems, which rely on copying data across multiple cores. Unfortunately, copying quantum data is theoretically prohibited due to the quantum non-cloning theory. Instead, quantum circuit cutting techniques cut a large quantum circuit into multiple smaller subcircuits, distribute the subcircuits on parallel QPUs and reconstruct the results with classical computing. Such techniques make distributed hybrid quantum computing (DHQC) a possibility but also introduce an exponential classical co-processing cost in the number of cuts and easily become intractable. This paper presents TensorQC, which leverages classical tensor networks to bring an exponential runtime advantage over state-of-the-art parallelization post-processing techniques. As a result, this paper demonstrates running benchmarks that are otherwise intractable for a standalone QPU and prior circuit cutting techniques. Specifically, this paper runs six realistic benchmarks using QPUs available nowadays and a single GPU, and reduces the QPU size and quality requirements by more than $10\times$ over purely quantum platforms.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03445'&gt;arXiv:2502.03445&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 05 Feb 2025 18:42:07 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Page Curve and Entanglement Dynamics in an Interacting Fermionic Chain</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03563</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Rishabh Jha, Salvatore R. Manmana, Stefan Kehrein&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Generic non-equilibrium many-body systems display a linear growth of bipartite entanglement entropy in time, followed by a volume law saturation. In stark contrast, the Page curve dynamics of black hole physics shows that the entropy peaks at the Page time $t_{\text{Page}}$ and then decreases to zero. Here, we investigate such Page-like behavior of the von Neumann entropy in a model of strongly correlated spinless fermions in a typical system-environment setup, and characterize the properties of the Page curve dynamics in the presence of interactions using numerically exact matrix product states methods. The two phases of growth, namely the linear growth and the bending down, are shown to be separated by a non-analyticity in the min-entropy before $t_{\text{Page}}$, which separates two different quantum phases, realized as the respective ground states of the corresponding entanglement (or equivalently, modular) Hamiltonian. We confirm and generalize, by introducing interactions, the findings of \href{https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.109.224308}{Phys. Rev. B 109, 224308 (2024)} for a free spinless fermionic chain where the corresponding entanglement Hamiltonian undergoes a quantum phase transition at the point of non-analyticity. However, in the presence of interactions, a scaling analysis gives a non-zero critical time for the non-analyticity in the thermodynamic limit only for weak to intermediate interaction strengths, while the dynamics leading to the non-analyticity becomes \textit{instantaneous} for interactions large enough. We present a physical picture explaining these findings.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03563'&gt;arXiv:2502.03563&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 05 Feb 2025 19:22:48 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Tensor Decomposition Meets Knowledge Compilation: A Study Comparing Tensor Trains with OBDDs</title>

This enables the selection of appropriate representations for different applications. In the knowledge compilation map, all representation classes are subsets of the negation normal form (NNF). However, Boolean functions may be better expressed by a representation that is different from that of the NNF subsets. In this study, we treat tensor trains as Boolean function representations and analyze their succinctness and tractability. Our study is the first to evaluate the expressiveness of a tensor decomposition method using criteria from knowledge compilation literature. Our main results demonstrate that tensor trains are more succinct than ordered binary decision diagrams (OBDDs) and support the same polytime operations as OBDDs. Our study broadens their application by providing a theoretical link between tensor decomposition and existing NNF subsets.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03702'&gt;arXiv:2502.03702&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 06 Feb 2025 01:24:32 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Crossover from Wannier-Stark localization to charge density waves for interacting spinless fermions in one dimension</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04866</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Nair Aucar Boidi, Amnon Aharony, Ora Entin-Wohlman, Karen Hallberg, Cesar Proetto&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We study spinless fermions on a finite chain with nearest-neighbor repulsion and in the presence of a Wannier-Stark linearly-varying electric field potential. In the absence of the interaction, the eigenstates are localized for the system's sizes larger than the localization length. We present several analytical expressions for the localization length, which is proportional to the inverse of the electric field. Using the density matrix renormalization group numerical technique, we observe that the ground state exhibits a decrease of the occupation on the chain sites from the `bulk', with occupation 1, to the vacuum, with occupation 0. The width of this intermediate `edge' region is also inversely proportional to the electric field, increasing linearly with the strength of the nearest-neighbor repulsion. For strong interactions, the occupations in the intermediate region exhibit a charge density wave. We also present the local density of states for sites in the `edge' region. For the non-interacting case, the spectrum shows an increasing energy-localized structure as the field is increased, which is a consequence of the uniform energy distribution of the localized states (Wannier-Stark ladder). This structure survives for small interactions, and it smears out in the strongly interacting limit. Experimental variations of the slope of the potential (the electric field) on cold atom chains may test these predictions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04866'&gt;arXiv:2502.04866&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 07 Feb 2025 12:13:28 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>High-dimensional stochastic finite volumes using the tensor train format</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Juliette Dubois, Michael Herty, Siegfried Müller&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We propose a method for the uncertainty quantification of nonlinear hyperbolic equations with many uncertain parameters. The method combines the stochastic finite volume method and tensor trains in a novel way: the physical space and time dimensions are kept as full tensors, while all stochastic dimensions are compressed together into a tensor train. The resulting hybrid format has one tensor train for each spatial cell and each time step. We adapt a MUSCL scheme to this hybrid format and show the feasibility of the approach using several classical test cases. A convergence study is done on the Burgers' equation with three stochastic parameters. We also solve the Burgers' equation for an increasing number of stochastic dimensions and show an example with the Euler equations. The presented method opens new avenues for combining uncertainty quantification with well-known numerical schemes for conservation law.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04868'&gt;arXiv:2502.04868&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 07 Feb 2025 12:17:41 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Generative-enhanced optimization for knapsack problems: an industry-relevant study</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Yelyzaveta Vodovozova, Abhishek Awasthi, Caitlin Jones, Joseph Doetsch, Karen Wintersperger, Florian Krellner, Carlos A. Riofrío&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Optimization is a crucial task in various industries such as logistics, aviation, manufacturing, chemical, pharmaceutical, and insurance, where finding the best solution to a problem can result in significant cost savings and increased efficiency. Tensor networks (TNs) have gained prominence in recent years in modeling classical systems with quantum-inspired approaches. More recently, TN generative-enhanced optimization (TN-GEO) has been proposed as a strategy which uses generative modeling to efficiently sample valid solutions with respect to certain constraints of optimization problems. Moreover, it has been shown that symmetric TNs (STNs) can encode certain constraints of optimization problems, thus aiding in their solution process. In this work, we investigate the applicability of TN- and STN-GEO to an industry relevant problem class, a multi-knapsack problem, in which each object must be assigned to an available knapsack. We detail a prescription for practitioners to use the TN-and STN-GEO methodology and study its scaling behavior and dependence on its hyper-parameters. We benchmark 60 different problem instances and find that TN-GEO and STN-GEO produce results of similar quality to simulated annealing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04928'&gt;arXiv:2502.04928&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 07 Feb 2025 13:47:23 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Gaussian Models to Non-Gaussian Realms of Quantum Photonic Simulators</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Dennis Delali Kwesi Wayo, Rodrigo Alves Dias, Masoud Darvish Ganji, Camila Martins Saporetti, Leonardo Goliatt&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Quantum photonic simulators have emerged as indispensable tools for modeling and optimizing quantum photonic circuits, bridging the gap between theoretical models and experimental implementations. This review explores the landscape of photonic quantum simulation, focusing on the transition from Gaussian to non-Gaussian models and the computational challenges associated with simulating large-scale photonic systems. Gaussian states and operations, which enable efficient simulations through covariance matrices and phase-space representations, serve as the foundation for photonic quantum computing. However, non-Gaussian states crucial for universal quantum computation introduce significant computational complexity, requiring advanced numerical techniques such as tensor networks and high-performance GPU acceleration. We evaluate the leading photonic quantum simulators, including Strawberry Fields, Piquasso, QuTiP SimulaQron, Perceval, and QuantumOPtics.jl analyzing their capabilities in handling continuous-variable (CV) and discrete-variable (DV) quantum systems. Special attention is given to hardware-accelerated methods, including GPU-based tensor network approaches, machine learning integration, and hybrid quantum-classical workflows. Furthermore, we investigate noise modeling techniques, such as photon loss and dark counts, and their impact on simulation accuracy. As photonic quantum computing moves toward practical implementations, advancements in high-performance computing (HPC) architectures, such as tensor processing units (TPUs) and system-on-a-chip (SoC) solutions, are accelerating the field. This review highlights emerging trends, challenges, and future directions for developing scalable and efficient photonic quantum simulators.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05245'&gt;arXiv:2502.05245&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 07 Feb 2025 15:04:42 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Anomalous suppression of large-scale density fluctuations in classical and quantum spin liquids</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05313</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Duyu Chen, Rhine Samajdar, Yang Jiao, Salvatore Torquato&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Classical spin liquids (CSLs) are intriguing states of matter that do not exhibit long-range magnetic order and are characterized by an extensive ground-state degeneracy. Adding quantum fluctuations, which induce dynamics between these different classical ground states, can give rise to quantum spin liquids (QSLs). QSLs are highly entangled quantum phases of matter characterized by fascinating emergent properties, such as fractionalized excitations and topological order. One such exotic quantum liquid is the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ QSL, which can be regarded as a resonating valence bond (RVB) state formed from superpositions of dimer coverings of an underlying lattice. In this work, we unveil a \textit{hidden} large-scale structural property of archetypal CSLs and QSLs known as hyperuniformity, i.e., normalized infinite-wavelength density fluctuations are completely suppressed in these systems. In particular, we first demonstrate that classical ensembles of close-packed dimers and their corresponding quantum RVB states are perfectly hyperuniform in general. Subsequently, we focus on a ruby-lattice spin liquid that was recently realized in a Rydberg-atom quantum simulator, and show that the QSL remains effectively hyperuniform even in the presence of a finite density of spinon and vison excitations, as long as the dimer constraint is still largely preserved. Moreover, we demonstrate that metrics based on the framework of hyperuniformity can be used to distinguish the QSL from other proximate quantum phases. These metrics can help identify potential QSL candidates, which can then be further analyzed using more advanced, computationally-intensive quantum numerics to confirm their status as true QSLs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05313'&gt;arXiv:2502.05313&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 07 Feb 2025 20:28:40 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Qubit Regularization of Quantum Field Theories</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05716</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Shailesh Chandrasekharan&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; To study quantum field theories on a quantum computer, we must begin with Hamiltonians defined on a finite-dimensional Hilbert space and then take appropriate limits. This approach can be seen as a new type of regularization for quantum field theories, which we refer to as qubit regularization. A related finite-dimensional regularization, known as the D-theory approach, was proposed long ago as a general framework for all quantum field theories. In this framework, the dimensionality of the local Hilbert space at each spatial point can increase as needed through an additional flavor index. To reproduce asymptotically free QFTs, most studies assume that qubit-regularized theories require extending the local Hilbert space to infinity. However, contrary to this common belief, recent discoveries in (1+1) dimensions have revealed two examples where asymptotic freedom appears to emerge within a strictly finite-dimensional local Hilbert space through a novel renormalization group (RG) flow. These findings motivate further investigation into whether asymptotically free gauge theories could also emerge within a strictly finite-dimensional local Hilbert space. To support these explorations, we propose an orthonormal basis called the monomer-dimer-tensor-network (MDTN) basis and use it to construct new types of qubit-regularized lattice gauge theories.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05716'&gt;arXiv:2502.05716&lt;/a&gt;] Published Sat, 08 Feb 2025 22:58:37 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Explicit Solution Equation for Every Combinatorial Problem via Tensor Networks: MeLoCoToN</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Alejandro Mata Ali&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; In this paper we show that every combinatorial problem has an exact explicit equation that returns its solution. We present a method to obtain an equation that solves exactly any combinatorial problem, both inversion, constraint satisfaction and optimization, by obtaining its equivalent tensor network. This formulation only requires a basic knowledge of classical logical operators, at a first year level of any computer science degree. These equations are not necessarily computable in a reasonable time, nor do they allow to surpass the state of the art in computational complexity, but they allow to have a new perspective for the mathematical analysis of these problems. These equations computation can be approximated by different methods such as Matrix Product State compression. We also present the equations for numerous combinatorial problems. This work proves that, if there is a physical system capable of contracting in polynomial time the tensor networks presented, every NP-Hard problem can be solved in polynomial time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05981'&gt;arXiv:2502.05981&lt;/a&gt;] Published Sun, 09 Feb 2025 18:16:53 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

We propose a new tensor network representation for the model using the quadrature scheme and confirm that its accuracy is better than that of the conventional character-like expansion. As a probe to study the phase structure, we adopt the central charge and the scaling dimensions. The numerical results indicate an existence of critical point at $\theta=\pi$, which is consistent with the Haldane's conjecture.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06135'&gt;arXiv:2502.06135&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 10 Feb 2025 03:51:12 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Floquet-Engineered Hybrid Topological Orders with Majorana Edge Modes in Number-Conserving Fermionic Quantum Simulators</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Zhi Lin, Qi Song, Sheng Yue, Ming Yang, Jie Lou, Yan Chen&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We develop an experimental protocol based on Floquet-engineered ultracold fermions in optical lattices, enabling the emulation of pair-hopping and competing singlet/triplet pairing interactions. Through large-scale density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations, we uncover three emergent topological phases: (i) A Majorana-enabled spin-density-wave (MS) phase featuring exponentially localized edge charges, non-local fermionic edge correlations, and doubly degenerate entanglement spectra; (ii) A z-axis polarized triplet superconducting (TS) phase exhibiting fractionalized edge spins (S=1/4 per edge), two-fold ground state degeneracy and a bulk single-particle gap; (iii) A hybrid x-directional triplet superconducting (XTS) phase that uniquely combines fractional spin textures and Majorana-type edge correlations, defining a new universality class of hybrid orders in number-conserving systems. These findings establish a universal framework for engineering non-Abelian topological matter, crucially bypassing the need for external pairing fields while maintaining experimental feasibility with current cold-atom techniques.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06569'&gt;arXiv:2502.06569&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 10 Feb 2025 15:36:02 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Exact NESS of XXZ circuits boundary driven with arbitrary resets or fields</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Vladislav Popkov, Tomaž Prosen&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We propose spatially inhomogeneous matrix product ansatz for an exact many-body density operator of a boundary driven XXZ quantum circuit. The ansatz has formally infinite bond-dimension and is fundamentally different from previous constructions. The circuit is driven by a pair of reset quantum channels applied on the boundary qubits, which polarize the qubits to arbitrary pure target states. Moreover, one of the reset channels can be replaced by an arbitrary local unitary gate, thus representing a hybrid case with coherent/incoherent driving. Analyzing the ansatz we obtain a family of relatively robust separable nonequilibrium steady states (NESS), which can be viewed as a circuit extension of spin-helix states, and are particularly suited for experimental investigations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06731'&gt;arXiv:2502.06731&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 10 Feb 2025 17:56:37 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Computing Quantum Resources using Tensor Cross Interpolation</title>

Consequently, developing efficient and robust numerical methods for their computation is crucial. We propose a general procedure based on the family of Tensor Cross Interpolation (TCI) algorithms to address this challenge in a fully general framework, independent of the system or the quantifier under consideration. To substantiate our approach, we compute the non-stabilizerness R\'{e}nyi entropy (SRE) and Relative Entropy of Coherence (REC) considering the 1D and 2D ferromagnetic Ising models with minimal modifications to the numerical procedure. This method not only demonstrates its versatility, but also provides a generic framework for exploring other quantum information quantifiers in complex systems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06956'&gt;arXiv:2502.06956&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 10 Feb 2025 19:00:24 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

Green&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We time-evolve a translationally invariant quantum state on the Quantinuum H1-1 trapped-ion quantum processor, studying the dynamical quantum phase transition of the transverse field Ising model. This physics requires a delicate cancellation of phases in the many-body wavefunction and presents a tough challenge for current quantum devices. We follow the dynamics using a quantum circuit matrix product state ansatz, optimised for the time-evolution using a fidelity cost function. Sampling costs are mitigated by using the measured values of this circuit as stochastic corrections to a simple classical extrapolation of the ansatz parameters. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of variational quantum time-evolution and reveal a hitherto hidden simplicity of the evolution of the transverse-field Ising model through the dynamical quantum phase transition.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06961'&gt;arXiv:2502.06961&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 10 Feb 2025 19:01:28 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Lagrangian Attention Tensor Networks for Velocity Gradient Statistical Modeling</title>

Motivated by phenomenology and recent data-driven works based on universality of the smallest scales in fully developed turbulence, the statistical dynamics of the velocity gradient tensor (VGT) at the Kolmogorov scale become of critical importance in advancing turbulence models. Physics-informed machine learning has found considerable success in exploiting large datasets taken from direct numerical simulation of Navier-Stokes to improve models for the evolution of the VGT. In this work, we follow the long line of blending physical insight with data analysis to simultaneously advance both the modeling and understanding of the phenomenology of the VGT. Using the intimate connection between VGT evolution and fluid deformation, we develop the Lagrangian attention tensor network approach that significantly improves over current physics-informed machine learning methods. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in both a-priori and a-posteriori metrics, before interpreting the trained attention mechanisms to discover a surprising connection between the history of the strain-rate-tensor and the pressure Hessian.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07078'&gt;arXiv:2502.07078&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 10 Feb 2025 22:11:47 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Lattice Defects in Rydberg Atom Arrays</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Hanteng Wang, Chengshu Li, Xingyu Li, Yingfei Gu, Shang Liu&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Rydberg atom arrays have become a key platform for studying quantum many-body systems. In these setups, defects arise naturally due to various imperfections and can significantly modify the theoretical predictions compared to an ideal model. Here, we investigate the impact of geometric defects in the simplest situation -- a one-dimensional Rydberg atom array, both at and away from its emergent Ising criticality. In the presence of defects, we demonstrate that relevant physical quantities can be extracted from one-point correlation functions. At the critical point, we show that different types of kinks yield distinct outcomes corresponding to their respective spatial-internal symmetries: site-centered kinks can effectively break the array at the kink position regardless of the kink angle, while bond-centered kinks lead to interesting intermediate-coupling fixed points. In the latter case, due to a special renormalization group flow trajectory, the whole system can appear ordered if the system is not large enough. Additionally, away from criticality, the bond-centered kink induces a localization-delocalization transition of the domain wall, characteristic of quantum wetting. These findings highlight the utility of kinks as experimental probes and stress the importance of controlling defects so that experimental observations remain faithful to the pristine model.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07886'&gt;arXiv:2502.07886&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 11 Feb 2025 19:00:03 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Probing the many-body localized spin-glass phase through quench dynamics</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Pietro Brighi, Marko Ljubotina, Maksym Serbyn&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Eigenstates of quantum many-body systems are often used to define phases of matter in and out of equilibrium; however, experimentally accessing highly excited eigenstates is a challenging task, calling for alternative strategies to dynamically probe nonequilibrium phases. In this work, we characterize the dynamical properties of a disordered spin chain, focusing on the spin-glass regime. Using tensor-network simulations, we observe oscillatory behavior of local expectation values and bipartite entanglement entropy. We explain these oscillations deep in the many-body localized spin glass regime via a simple theoretical model. From perturbation theory, we predict the timescales up to which our analytical description is valid and confirm it with numerical simulations. Finally, we study the correlation length dynamics, which, after a long-time plateau, resumes growing in line with renormalization group (RG) expectations. Our work suggests that RG predictions can be quantitatively tested against numerical simulations and experiments, potentially enabling microscopic descriptions of dynamical phases in large systems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08192'&gt;arXiv:2502.08192&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 12 Feb 2025 08:05:22 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

Such additional interaction correspond to the nearest and diagonal interactions on the square lattice. Phase diagram of the bare Kitaev model consist of low entangled commensurate magnetic phases and entagled Kitaev spin liquid. Anisotropic Ising interaction allows the entangled incommensurate magnetic phases in the phase diagram, which previously was predicted only for more complex type of interactions. We study the scaling law of the entanglement entropy and the bond dimension of the matrix product state with the size of the system. In addition, we propose an optimization algorithm to prevent DMRG from getting stuck in the low-entangled phases.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08389'&gt;arXiv:2502.08389&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 12 Feb 2025 13:25:29 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>The Saga of $α$-RuCl$_3$: Parameters, Models, and Phase Diagrams</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Marius Möller, P. A. Maksimov, Shengtao Jiang, Steven R. White, Roser Valenti, A. L. Chernyshev&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; RuCl$_3$ was likely the first ever deliberately synthesized ruthenium compound, following the discovery of the $_{44}$Ru element in 1844. For a long time it was known as an oxidation catalyst, with its physical properties being discrepant and confusing, until a decade ago when its allotropic form $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ rose to exceptional prominence. This "re-discovery" of $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ has not only reshaped the hunt for a material manifestation of the Kitaev spin liquid, but it has opened the floodgates of theoretical and experimental research in the many unusual phases and excitations that the anisotropic-exchange magnets as a class of compounds have to offer. Given its importance for the field of Kitaev materials, it is astonishing that the low-energy spin model that describes this compound and its possible proximity to the much-desired spin-liquid state is still a subject of significant debate ten years later. In the present study, we argue that the existing key phenomenological observations put strong natural constraints on the effective microscopic spin model of $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$, and specifically on its spin-orbit-induced anisotropic-exchange parameters that are responsible for the non-trivial physical properties of this material. These constraints allow one to focus on the relevant region of the multi-dimensional phase diagram of the $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ model, suggest an intuitive description of it via a different parametrization of the exchange matrix, offer a unifying view on the earlier assessments of its parameters, and bring closer together several approaches to the derivation of anisotropic-exchange models. We explore extended phase diagrams relevant to the $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ parameter space using quasi-classical, Luttinger-Tisza, exact diagonalization, and density-matrix renormalization group methods, demonstrating a remarkably c...

      <title>Dynamics of the Bose-Hubbard Model Induced by On-Site or Long-Range Two-Body Losses</title>

We first consider the one-dimensional chain and the two-dimensional square lattice, and study the dynamics induced by the sudden switch-on of two-body losses on a weakly-interacting superfluid state. The time-dependent density is obtained in the spirit of the Bogolyubov approach by calculating theoretically the equations of motion associated to the relevant quadratic bosonic correlators. In the one-dimensional case, our results compare very well with quasi-exact numerical calculations based on the quantum jump method implemented using tensor networks. We find that the intermediate-time dynamics of the density displays an algebraic decay characterized by an interaction-dependent power-law exponent. The latter property still holds for long-range two-body loss processes but it is absent in the two-dimensional square lattice with on-site losses.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09008'&gt;arXiv:2502.09008&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 13 Feb 2025 06:55:03 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Quantum Speed Limit and Quantum Thermodynamic Uncertainty Relation under Feedback Control</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09081</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Hayato Yunoki, Yoshihiko Hasegawa&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Quantum feedback control is a technique for controlling quantum dynamics by applying control inputs to the quantum system based on the results of measurements performed on the system. It is an important technique from both an applied and a fundamental theoretical point of view. There are two fundamental inequalities that describe trade-off relations in quantum mechanics, namely, the quantum speed limit and the quantum thermodynamic uncertainty relation. They characterize the operational limit of non-equilibrium quantum systems, making them essential for controlling such systems. Therefore, it is meaningful to formulate these trade-off relations within the framework of quantum feedback control. In this paper, we derive these inequalities based on the continuous matrix product state method. Additionally, we analytically derive the exact form of quantum dynamical activity under feedback control, which serves as the cost term in these inequalities. Specifically, we focus on the cases of Markovian feedback, i.e., the direct feedback of continuous measurement results. Our numerical analysis reveals that the presence of feedback control can improve the quantum speed limit time and the quality of continuous measurements. Furthermore, the relationship with quantum error correction, an important application of quantum feedback control, is discussed using numerical simulations. Thus, our work clarifies how feedback control affects these important trade-off relationships in quantum mechanics.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09081'&gt;arXiv:2502.09081&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 13 Feb 2025 08:55:20 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Mehrdad Ghadiri, Matthew Fahrbach, Yunbum Kook, Ali Jadbabaie&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We study tensor completion (TC) through the lens of low-rank tensor decomposition (TD). Many TD algorithms use fast alternating minimization methods to solve highly structured linear regression problems at each step (e.g., for CP, Tucker, and tensor-train decompositions). However, such algebraic structure is often lost in TC regression problems, making direct extensions unclear. This work proposes a novel lifting method for approximately solving TC regression problems using structured TD regression algorithms as blackbox subroutines, enabling sublinear-time methods. We analyze the convergence rate of our approximate Richardson iteration-based algorithm, and our empirical study shows that it can be 100x faster than direct methods for CP completion on real-world tensors.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09534'&gt;arXiv:2502.09534&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 13 Feb 2025 17:50:27 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Non-stabilizerness of Neural Quantum States</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09725</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Alessandro Sinibaldi, Antonio Francesco Mello, Mario Collura, Giuseppe Carleo&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We introduce a methodology to estimate non-stabilizerness or "magic", a key resource for quantum complexity, with Neural Quantum States (NQS). Our framework relies on two schemes based on Monte Carlo sampling to quantify non-stabilizerness via Stabilizer R\'enyi Entropy (SRE) in arbitrary variational wave functions. When combined with NQS, this approach is effective for systems with strong correlations and in dimensions larger than one, unlike Tensor Network methods. Firstly, we study the magic content in an ensemble of random NQS, demonstrating that neural network parametrizations of the wave function capture finite non-stabilizerness besides large entanglement. Secondly, we investigate the non-stabilizerness in the ground state of the $J_1$-$J_2$ Heisenberg model. In 1D, we find that the SRE vanishes at the Majumdar-Ghosh point $J_2 = J_1/2$, consistent with a stabilizer ground state. In 2D, a dip in the SRE is observed near maximum frustration around $J_2/J_1 \approx 0.6$, suggesting a Valence Bond Solid between the two antiferromagnetic phases.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09725'&gt;arXiv:2502.09725&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 13 Feb 2025 19:14:15 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Floquet Engineering and Harnessing Giant Atoms in Frequency-Comb Emission and Bichromatic Correlations in Waveguide QED</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09901</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Qing-Yang Qiu, Li-Li Zheng, Ying Wu, Xin-You Lu&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The capability to design spectrally controlled photon emission is not only fundamentally interesting for understanding frequency-encoded light-matter interactions, but also is essential for realizing the preparation and manipulation of quantum states. Here we consider a dynamically modulated qubit array, and realize frequency-controlled single-photon emission focusing on the generation of a frequency comb constituted solely of even-parity or anti-Stokes sidebands. Our system also offers parity-dependent bunching and antibunching in frequency-filtered quantum correlations. In particular, the waveguide quantum electrodynamics (QED) setup is extended to include chiral and non-local coupling architectures, thereby enhancing its versatility in Floquet engineering. Our proposal also supports the predictable generation of high-dimensional entangled quantum states, where the corresponding effective Hilbert space dimension is well controlled by energy modulation. Moreover, the utilisation of sophisticated numerical tools, such as the matrix product states (MPSs) and the discretization approach, enables the efficient simulation of multi-photon dynamics, in which the non-Markovian Floquet steady states emerge. This work fundamentally broadens the fields of collective emission, and has wide applications in implementing frequency-encoded quantum information processing and many-body quantum simulation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09901'&gt;arXiv:2502.09901&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 14 Feb 2025 04:18:54 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Deep Tree Tensor Networks for Image Recognition</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09928</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Chang Nie, Junfang Chen, Yajie Chen&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Originating in quantum physics, tensor networks (TNs) have been widely adopted as exponential machines and parameter decomposers for recognition tasks. Typical TN models, such as Matrix Product States (MPS), have not yet achieved successful application in natural image processing. When employed, they primarily serve to compress parameters within off-the-shelf networks, thus losing their distinctive capability to enhance exponential-order feature interactions. This paper introduces a novel architecture named \textit{\textbf{D}eep \textbf{T}ree \textbf{T}ensor \textbf{N}etwork} (DTTN), which captures $2^L$-order multiplicative interactions across features through multilinear operations, while essentially unfolding into a \emph{tree}-like TN topology with the parameter-sharing property. DTTN is stacked with multiple antisymmetric interacting modules (AIMs), and this design facilitates efficient implementation. Moreover, we theoretically reveal the equivalency among quantum-inspired TN models and polynomial and multilinear networks under certain conditions, and we believe that DTTN can inspire more interpretable studies in this field. We evaluate the proposed model against a series of benchmarks and achieve excellent performance compared to its peers and cutting-edge architectures. Our code will soon be publicly available.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09928'&gt;arXiv:2502.09928&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 14 Feb 2025 05:41:33 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Variationally optimizing infinite projected entangled-pair states at large bond dimensions: A split corner transfer matrix renormalization group approach</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10298</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Jan Naumann, Erik Lennart Weerda, Jens Eisert, Matteo Rizzi, Philipp Schmoll&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Projected entangled-pair states (PEPS) have become a powerful tool for studying quantum many-body systems in the condensed matter and quantum materials context, particularly with advances in variational energy optimization methods. A key challenge within this framework is the computational cost associated with the contraction of the two-dimensional lattice, crucial for calculating state vector norms and expectation values. The conventional approach, using the corner transfer matrix renormalization group (CTMRG), involves combining two tensor network layers, resulting in significant time and memory demands. In this work, we introduce an alternative "split-CTMRG" algorithm, which maintains separate PEPS layers and leverages new environment tensors, reducing computational complexity while preserving accuracy. Benchmarks on quantum lattice models demonstrate substantial speedups for variational energy optimization, rendering this method valuable for large-scale PEPS simulations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10298'&gt;arXiv:2502.10298&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 14 Feb 2025 16:59:33 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Alternating and Gaussian fermionic Isometric Tensor Network States</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10695</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Yantao Wu, Zhehao Dai, Sajant Anand, Sheng-Hsuan Lin, Qi Yang, Lei Wang, Frank Pollmann, Michael P. Zaletel&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Isometric tensor networks in two dimensions enable efficient and accurate study of quantum many-body states, yet the effect of the isometric restriction on the represented quantum states is not fully understood. We address this question in two main contributions. First, we introduce an improved variant of isometric network states (isoTNS) in two dimensions, where the isometric arrows on the columns of the network alternate between pointing upward and downward, hence the name alternating isometric tensor network states. Second, we introduce a numerical tool -- isometric Gaussian fermionic TNS (isoGfTNS) -- that incorporates isometric constraints into the framework of Gaussian fermionic tensor network states. We demonstrate in numerous ways that alternating isoTNS represent many-body ground states of two-dimensional quantum systems significantly better than the original isoTNS. First, we show that the entanglement in an isoTNS is mediated along the isometric arrows and that alternating isoTNS mediate entanglement more efficiently than conventional isoTNS. Second, alternating isoTNS correspond to a deeper, thus more representative, sequential circuit construction of depth $\mathcal{O}(L_x \cdot L_y)$ compared to the original isoTNS of depth $\mathcal{O}(L_x + L_y)$. Third, using the Gaussian framework and gradient-based energy minimization, we provide numerical evidences of better bond-dimension scaling and variational energy of alternating isoGfTNS for ground states of various free fermionic models, including the Fermi surface, the band insulator, and the $p_x + ip_y$ mean-field superconductor. Finally, we find improved performance of alternating isoTNS as compared to the original isoTNS for the ground state energy of the (interacting) transverse field Ising model.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10695'&gt;arXiv:2502.10695&lt;/a&gt;] Published Sat, 15 Feb 2025 07:00:38 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Canted magnetism and $\mathbb{Z}_2$ fractionalization in metallic states of the Lieb lattice Hubbard model near quarter filling</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12235</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Alexander Nikolaenko, Pietro M. Bonetti, Anant Kale, Martin Lebrat, Markus Greiner, Subir Sachdev&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; A recent experiment has examined ultracold, fermionic, spin-1/2 $^6$Li atoms in the Lieb lattice at different Hubbard repulsion $U$ and filling fractions $\nu$ (Lebrat et al. arXiv:2404.17555). At $\nu=1/2$ and small $U$, they observe an enhanced compressibility on the $p_{x,y}$ sites, pointing to a flat band near the Fermi energy. At $\nu=1/2$ and large $U$ they observe an insulating ferrimagnet. Both small and large $U$ observations at $\nu=1/2$ are consistent with theoretical expectations. Surprisingly, near $\nu=1/4$ and large $U$, they again observe a large $p_{x,y}$ compressibility, pointing to a flat $p_{x,y}$ band of fermions across the Fermi energy. Our Hartree-Fock computations near $\nu=1/4$ find states with canted magnetism (and related spiral states) at large $U$, which possess nearly flat $p_{x,y}$ bands near the Fermi level. We employ parton theories to describe quantum fluctuations of the magnetic order found in Hartree-Fock. We find a metallic state with $\mathbb{Z}_2$ fractionalization possessing gapless, fermionic, spinless `chargons' carrying $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge charges which have a nearly flat $p_{x,y}$ band near their Fermi level: this fractionalized metal is also consistent with observations. Our DMRG study does not indicate the presence of magnetic order, and so supports a fractionalized ground state. Given the conventional ferrimagnetic insulator at $\nu=1/2$, the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ fractionalized metal at $\nu=1/4$ represents a remarkable realization of doping-induced fractionalization.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12235'&gt;arXiv:2502.12235&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 17 Feb 2025 19:00:00 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Observable and computable entanglement in time</title>

Our definitions are applicable to any quantum system, continuous or discrete. To illustrate their utility, we derive upper and lower bounds on time-separated correlation functions, akin to the bound on spatially separated correlators in terms of the mutual information. In certain cases our bounds are tight. For relativistic quantum field theories our definition agrees with the analytic continuation from spacelike to timelike separated regions. We provide relevant measurement protocols and execute them on the IBM quantum device ibm_sherbrooke for a simple qubit system. Also we perform explicit computations for an Ising spin chain, free fermions, (1+1)-dimensional conformal field theories and holographic theories. Finally we explain how the proposed entanglement in time provides a microscopic definition for the recently introduced timelike pseudoentropy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12240'&gt;arXiv:2502.12240&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 17 Feb 2025 19:00:01 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Scalable Back-Propagation-Free Training of Optical Physics-Informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12384</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Yequan Zhao, Xinling Yu, Xian Xiao, Zhixiong Chen, Ziyue Liu, Geza Kurczveil, Raymond G. Beausoleil, Sijia Liu, Zheng Zhang&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have shown promise in solving partial differential equations (PDEs), with growing interest in their energy-efficient, real-time training on edge devices. Photonic computing offers a potential solution to achieve this goal because of its ultra-high operation speed. However, the lack of photonic memory and the large device sizes prevent training real-size PINNs on photonic chips. This paper proposes a completely back-propagation-free (BP-free) and highly salable framework for training real-size PINNs on silicon photonic platforms. Our approach involves three key innovations: (1) a sparse-grid Stein derivative estimator to avoid the BP in the loss evaluation of a PINN, (2) a dimension-reduced zeroth-order optimization via tensor-train decomposition to achieve better scalability and convergence in BP-free training, and (3) a scalable on-chip photonic PINN training accelerator design using photonic tensor cores. We validate our numerical methods on both low- and high-dimensional PDE benchmarks. Through circuit simulation based on real device parameters, we further demonstrate the significant performance benefit (e.g., real-time training, huge chip area reduction) of our photonic accelerator.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12384'&gt;arXiv:2502.12384&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 17 Feb 2025 23:45:23 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Abdessatar Souissi&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; This paper reveals the intrinsic structure of Matrix Product States (MPS) by establishing their deep connection to entangled hidden Markov models (EHMMs). It is demonstrated that a significant class of MPS can be derived as the outcomes of EHMMs, showcasing their underlying quantum correlations. Additionally, a lower bound is derived for the relative entropy between the EHMM-observation process and the corresponding MPS, providing a quantitative measure of their informational divergence. Conversely, it is shown that every MPS is naturally associated with an EHMM, further highlighting the interplay between these frameworks. These results are supported by illustrative examples from quantum information, emphasizing their importance in understanding entanglement, quantum correlations, and tensor network representations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12641'&gt;arXiv:2502.12641&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 18 Feb 2025 08:44:17 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Stability of Floquet sidebands and quantum coherence in 1D strongly interacting spinless fermions</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12643</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Karun Gadge, Salvatore R. Manmana&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; For strongly correlated quantum systems, fundamental questions about the formation and stability of Floquet-Bloch sidebands (FBs) upon periodic driving remain unresolved. Here, we investigate the impact of electron-electron interactions and perturbations in the coherence of the driving on the lifetime of FBs by directly computing time-dependent single-particle spectral functions using exact diagonalization (ED) and matrix product states (MPS). We study interacting metallic and correlated insulating phases in a chain of correlated spinless fermions. At high-frequency driving we obtain clearly separated, long-lived FBs of the full many-body excitation continuum. However, if there is significant overlap of the features, which is more probable in the low-frequency regime, the interactions lead to strong heating, which results in a significant loss of quantum coherence and of the FBs. Similar suppression of FBs is obtained in the presence of noise. The emerging picture is further elucidated by the behavior of real-space single-particle propagators, of the energy gain, and of the momentum distribution function, which is related to a quantum Fisher information that is directly accessible by spectroscopic measurements.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12643'&gt;arXiv:2502.12643&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 18 Feb 2025 08:50:21 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Relaxation dynamics of a quantum spin coupled to a topological edge state</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12715</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Qiyu Liu, Christoph Karrasch, Dante Marvin Kennes, Roman Rausch&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; A classical impurity spin coupled to the spinful Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) chain is known to exhibit complex switching dynamics with incomplete spin relaxation. Here, we study the corrections that result from a full quantum treatment of the impurity spin. We find that in the topologically trivial case, the quantum spin behaves similarly to the classical one due to the absence of the Kondo effect for the trivial insulator. In the topological case, the quantum spin is significantly less likely to relax: It can be stuck at a pre-relaxation plateau with a sizable deviation from the expected relaxed value, and there is a large parameter regime where it does not relax at all but features an anomalously large Larmor frequency. Furthermore, we find an additional quantum effect where the pre-relaxation plateau can be hyperpolarized, i.e., the spin is stuck at a polarization value larger than the ground-state expectation value. This is possible due to the (incomplete) Kondo screening of the quantum spin, which is absent in the classical case. Our results are obtained via the ground state density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) algorithm and the time-dependent variational principle (TDVP), where the charge-SU(2) symmetry of the problem was exploited. Furthermore, we introduce and benchmark a method to predict the dynamics from the given numerical data based on the sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy). This allows us to prolong the simulation timescale by a factor of 2.5, up to a maximal time of $10^3$ inverse hoppings.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12715'&gt;arXiv:2502.12715&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 18 Feb 2025 10:26:58 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

Using tensor network methods, we show that for m/g &gt; 1/{\pi}, in the vicinity of the strong to weak coupling transition, a nearly perfect and chargeless effective fluid behavior appears around the mid-rapidity region with a universal energy-pressure relationship. The evolution of energy and pressure is strongly correlated with the rise of the spatial entanglement entropy, indicating a key role of quantum dynamics. Some of these observations may be used to analyze high multiplicity jet fragmentation events, energy-energy and energy-charge correlators at current collider energies.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12901'&gt;arXiv:2502.12901&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 18 Feb 2025 14:41:15 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>The Canonical Forms of Matrix Product States in Infinite-Dimensional Hilbert Spaces</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Niilo Heikkinen&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; In this work, we prove that any element in the tensor product of separable infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces can be expressed as a matrix product state (MPS) of possibly infinite bond dimension. The proof is based on the singular value decomposition of compact operators and the connection between tensor products and Hilbert-Schmidt operators via the Schmidt decomposition in infinite-dimensional separable Hilbert spaces. The construction of infinite-dimensional MPS (idMPS) is analogous to the well-known finite-dimensional construction in terms of singular value decompositions of matrices. The infinite matrices in idMPS give rise to operators acting on (possibly infinite-dimensional) auxiliary Hilbert spaces. As an example we explicitly construct an MPS representation for certain eigenstates of a chain of three coupled harmonic oscillators.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12934'&gt;arXiv:2502.12934&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 18 Feb 2025 15:16:04 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Tensor cross interpolation for global discrete optimization with application to Bayesian network inference</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12940</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Sergey Dolgov, Dmitry Savostyanov&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Global discrete optimization is notoriously difficult due to the lack of gradient information and the curse of dimensionality, making exhaustive search infeasible. Tensor cross approximation is an efficient technique to approximate multivariate tensors (and discretized functions) by tensor product decompositions based on a small number of tensor elements, evaluated on adaptively selected fibers of the tensor, that intersect on submatrices of (nearly) maximum volume. The submatrices of maximum volume are empirically known to contain large elements, hence the entries selected for cross interpolation can also be good candidates for the globally maximal element within the tensor. In this paper we consider evolution of epidemics on networks, and infer the contact network from observations of network nodal states over time. By numerical experiments we demonstrate that the contact network can be inferred accurately by finding the global maximum of the likelihood using tensor cross interpolation. The proposed tensor product approach is flexible and can be applied to global discrete optimization for other problems, e.g. discrete hyperparameter tuning.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12940'&gt;arXiv:2502.12940&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 18 Feb 2025 15:21:26 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Predictive simulations of the dynamical response of mesoscopic devices</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12960</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Samuel Boutin, Torsten Karzig, Tareq El Dandachi, Ryan V. Mishmash, Jan Gukelberger, Roman M. Lutchyn, Bela Bauer&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; As the complexity of mesoscopic quantum devices increases, simulations are becoming an invaluable tool for understanding their behavior. This is especially true for the superconductor-semiconductor heterostructures used to build Majorana-based topological qubits, where quantitatively understanding the interplay of topological superconductivity, disorder, semiconductor quantum dots, Coulomb blockade and noise has been essential for progress on device design and interpretation of measurements. In this paper, we describe a general framework to simulate the low-energy quantum dynamics of such complex systems. We illustrate our approach by computing the dispersive gate sensing (DGS) response of quantum dots coupled to topological superconductors. We start by formulating the DGS response as an open-system quantum dynamics problem, which allows a consistent treatment of drive backaction as well as quantum and classical noise. For microscopic quantum problems subject to Coulomb-blockade, where a direct solution in the exponentially large many-body Hilbert space would be prohibitive, we introduce a series of controlled approximations that incorporate ideas from tensor network theory and quantum chemistry to reduce this Hilbert space to a few low-energy degrees of freedom that accurately capture the low-energy quantum dynamics. We demonstrate the methods introduced in this paper on the example of a single quantum dot coupled to a topological superconductor and a microscopic realization of the fermion parity readout setup of Aghaee et al. arXiv:2401.09549 (2024).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12960'&gt;arXiv:2502.12960&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 18 Feb 2025 15:44:40 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

This paper introduces tn4ml, a novel library designed to seamlessly integrate Tensor Networks into optimization pipelines for Machine Learning tasks. Inspired by existing Machine Learning frameworks, the library offers a user-friendly structure with modules for data embedding, objective function definition, and model training using diverse optimization strategies. We demonstrate its versatility through two examples: supervised learning on tabular data and unsupervised learning on an image dataset. Additionally, we analyze how customizing the parts of the Machine Learning pipeline for Tensor Networks influences performance metrics.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13090'&gt;arXiv:2502.13090&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 18 Feb 2025 17:57:29 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Triangular lattice models of the Kalmeyer-Laughlin spin liquid from coupled wires</title>

Mross&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Chiral spin liquids (CSLs) are exotic phases of interacting spins in two dimensions, characterized by long-range entanglement and fractional excitations. We construct a local Hamiltonian on the triangular lattice that stabilizes the Kalmeyer-Laughlin CSL without requiring fine-tuning. Our approach employs coupled-wire constructions and introduces a lattice duality to construct a solvable chiral sliding Luttinger liquid, which is driven towards the CSL phase by generic perturbations. By combining symmetry analysis and bosonization, we make sharp predictions for the ground states on quasi-one-dimensional cylinders and tori, which exhibit a four-fold periodicity in the circumference. Extensive tensor network simulations demonstrating ground state degeneracies, fractional quasi-particles, non-vanishing long-range order parameters, and entanglement signatures confirm the emergence of the CSL in the lattice Hamiltonian.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13223'&gt;arXiv:2502.13223&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 18 Feb 2025 19:02:32 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

Using bond dimensions of up to $D=28$, we show that we can surpass state-of-the-art DMRG energies that use up to $m=32000$ SU(2) multiplets on 8-leg ladders. We further apply our methodology to $10\times 16$, $12\times 16$ and $16 \times 16$ lattices at $1/8$ hole doping and observe the dimensional crossover between stripe orientations. Our work shows the power of finite-size fermionic tensor networks to resolve the physics of the 2D Hubbard model and related problems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13454'&gt;arXiv:2502.13454&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 19 Feb 2025 06:04:20 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Correcting and extending Trotterized quantum many-body dynamics</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13784</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Gian Gentinetta, Friederike Metz, Giuseppe Carleo&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; A complex but important challenge in understanding quantum mechanical phenomena is the simulation of quantum many-body dynamics. Although quantum computers offer significant potential to accelerate these simulations, their practical application is currently limited by noise and restricted scalability. In this work, we address these problems by proposing a hybrid ansatz combining the strengths of quantum and classical computational methods. Using Trotterization, we evolve an initial state on the quantum computer according to a simplified Hamiltonian, focusing on terms that are difficult to simulate classically. A classical model then corrects the simulation by including the terms omitted in the quantum circuit. While the classical ansatz is optimized during the time evolution, the quantum circuit has no variational parameters. Derivatives can thus be calculated purely classically, avoiding challenges arising in the optimization of parameterized quantum circuits. We demonstrate three applications of this hybrid method. First, our approach allows us to avoid SWAP gates in the quantum circuit by restricting the quantum part of the ansatz to hardware-efficient terms of the Hamiltonian. Second, we can mitigate errors arising from the Trotterization of the time evolution unitary. Finally, we can extend the system size while keeping the number of qubits on the quantum device constant by including additional degrees of freedom in the classical ansatz.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13784'&gt;arXiv:2502.13784&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 19 Feb 2025 14:50:12 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Extended $s$-wave pairing from an emergent Feshbach resonanc in bilayer nickelate superconductors</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13960</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Pietro Borchia, Hannah Lange, Fabian Grusdt&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Since the discovery of unconventional superconductivity in cuprates, unraveling the pairing mechanism of charge carriers in doped antiferromagnets has been a long-standing challenge. Motivated by the discovery of high-T$_c$ superconductivity in nickelate bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ (LNO), we study a minimal mixed dimensional (MixD) $t-J$ model supplemented with a repulsive Coulomb interaction $V$. When hole-doped, previous numerical simulations revealed that the system exhibits strong binding energies, with a phenomenology resembling a BCS-to-BEC crossover accompanied by a Feshbach resonance between two distinct types of charge carriers. Here, we perform a mean-field analysis that enables a direct observation of the BCS-to-BEC crossover as well as microscopic insights into the crossover region and the pairing symmetry for two-dimensional bilayers. We benchmark our mean-field description by comparing it to density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations in quasi-one dimensional settings and find remarkably good agreement. For the two-dimensional system relevant to LNO our mean-field calculations predict a BCS pairing gap with an extended $s$-wave symmetry, directly resulting from the pairing mechanism's Feshbach-origin. Our analysis hence gives insights into pairing in unconventional superconductors and, further, can be tested in currently available ultracold atom experiments.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13960'&gt;arXiv:2502.13960&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 19 Feb 2025 18:57:32 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Decoherence-induced self-dual criticality in topological states of matter</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14034</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Qingyuan Wang, Romain Vasseur, Simon Trebst, Andreas W. W. Ludwig, Guo-Yi Zhu&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Quantum measurements can be employed to induce decoherence in a restricted segment of a larger quantum many-body state, while generating entanglement for its remaining constituents. We demonstrate generally that measurement-induced phase transitions can be viewed as decoherence-induced critical mixed states. In this context, a deeper conceptual understanding is called for with regard to symmetry as an organizing principle. Integrating these connections we investigate the role of self-dual symmetry in mixed states, showing that the decoherence of electric (e) and magnetic (m) vortices from the 2D bulk of the toric code, or equivalently, a 2D cluster state with symmetry-protected topological order, can leave a (1+1)D quantum critical mixed state on the boundary protected by a weak Kramers-Wannier self-dual symmetry. The corresponding self-dual critical bulk is described by the $N\to1$ limit of the 2D Non-linear Sigma Model in symmetry class D with target space SO(2N)/U(N) at $\Theta$-angle $\pi$, and represents a "measurement-version" of the Cho-Fisher network model subjected to Born-rule randomness. Explicit breaking of self-duality, by incoherent noise amounting to fermion interactions or (non-interacting) coherent deformation, is shown to induce an RG crossover from this self-dual critical state to Nishimori criticality or to it from a novel type of Ising+ criticality, respectively, both related to the random-bond Ising model in different replica limits. Using an unbiased numerical approach combining tensor network, Monte Carlo, and Gaussian fermion simulations, we chart out a global phase diagram as diagnosed by coherent information and entanglement entropy measures. Our results point to a way towards a general understanding of mixed-state criticality in open quantum systems in terms of symmetry and topology.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14034'&gt;arXiv:2502.14034&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 19 Feb 2025 19:00:02 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Quantum spin liquid phase in the Shastry-Sutherland model revealed by high-precision infinite projected entangled-pair states</title>

Motivated by the recent controversy regarding its phase diagram at zero magnetic field, we perform large-scale simulations based on infinite projected entangled-pair states (iPEPS), a two-dimensional tensor network ansatz to represent the ground state directly in the thermodynamic limit. By employing the latest optimization techniques, we obtain variational states with lower energy than previous results obtained from other methods. Using systematic extrapolations to the exact infinite bond dimension limit, our simulations reveal a narrow quantum spin liquid phase between the plaquette and antiferromagnetic phases in the range $0.785(5) \le J'/J \le 0.82(1)$.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14091'&gt;arXiv:2502.14091&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 19 Feb 2025 20:35:13 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Monomer-dimer tensor-network basis for qubit-regularized lattice gauge theories</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14175</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Shailesh Chandrasekharan, Rui Xian Siew, Tanmoy Bhattacharya&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Traditional $\mathrm{SU}(N)$ lattice gauge theories (LGTs) can be formulated using an orthonormal basis constructed from the irreducible representations (irreps) $V_{\lambda}$ of the $\mathrm{SU}(N)$ gauge symmetry. On a lattice, the elements of this basis are tensor networks comprising dimer tensors on the links labeled by a set of irreps $\{\lambda_\ell\}$ and monomer tensors on sites labeled by $\{\lambda_s\}$. These tensors naturally define a local site Hilbert space, $\mathcal{H}^g_s$, on which gauge transformations act. Gauss's law introduces an additional index $\alpha_s = 1, 2, \dots, \mathcal{D}(\mathcal{H}_s^g)$ that labels an orthonormal basis of the gauge-invariant subspace of $\mathcal{H}^g_s$. This monomer-dimer tensor-network (MDTN) basis, $\left| \{\lambda_s\},\{\lambda_\ell\},\{\alpha_s\}\right\rangle$, of the physical Hilbert space enables the construction of new qubit-regularized $\mathrm{SU}(N)$ gauge theories that are free of sign problems while preserving key features of traditional LGTs. Here, we investigate finite-temperature confinement-deconfinement transitions in a simple qubit-regularized $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ and $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ gauge theory in $d=2$ and $d=3$ spatial dimensions, formulated using the MDTN basis, and show that they reproduce the universal results of traditional LGTs at these transitions. Additionally, in $d=1$, we demonstrate using a plaquette chain that the string tension at zero temperature can be continuously tuned to zero by adjusting a model parameter that plays the role of the gauge coupling in traditional LGTs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14175'&gt;arXiv:2502.14175&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 20 Feb 2025 01:06:39 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Ce Shen&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We investigate the phase diagram of a quantum many-body system constructed via the strange correlator approach, based on the non-Abelian $SU(2)_4$ fusion category, to probe topological phase transitions. Using tensor network methods, we numerically compute the half-infinite chain entanglement entropy derived from the dominant eigenvector of the transfer matrix and map the entropy across a spherical two-dimensional parameter space. Our results reveal a phase diagram significantly more complex than previously reported, including a gapless phase consistent with a conformal field theory (CFT) of central charge $c=1$. Critical lines separating distinct phases are identified, with one such line bounding the CFT phase exhibiting a higher central charge $c=2$, indicative of an unconventional critical regime.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14556'&gt;arXiv:2502.14556&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 20 Feb 2025 13:36:03 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Topological phase transition through tunable nearest-neighbor interactions in a one-dimensional lattice</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14603</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Rajashri Parida, Diptiman Sen, Tapan Mishra&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We investigate the phase diagram of a one-dimensional model of hardcore bosons or spinless fermions with tunable nearest-neighbor interactions. By introducing alternating repulsive and attractive interactions on consecutive bonds, we show that the system undergoes a transition from a bond-ordered (BO) phase to a charge-density wave-II (CDW-II) phase as the attractive interaction strength increases at a fixed repulsive interaction. For a specific interaction pattern, the BO phase exhibits topological properties, which vanish when the pattern is altered, leading to a transition from a topological BO phase to a trivial BO phase through a gap-closing point where both interactions vanish. We identify these phases using a combination of order parameters, topological invariants, edge-state analysis and Thouless charge pumping. By extending our analysis beyond half-filling, we explore the phase diagram across all densities and identify the superfluid (SF) and the pair-superfluid (PSF) phases, characterized by single-particle and bound-pair excitations at incommensurate densities. The proposed model is experimentally realizable in platforms such as Rydberg excited or ultracold atoms in optical lattices, offering a versatile framework to study such interplay between topology and interactions in low-dimensional systems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14603'&gt;arXiv:2502.14603&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 20 Feb 2025 14:36:43 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Emergent Goldstone flat bands and spontaneous symmetry breaking with type-B Goldstone modes</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14605</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Huan-Qiang Zhou, Jesse J. Osborne, Qian-Qian Shi, Ian P. McCulloch&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; For a quantum many-body spin system undergoing spontaneous symmetry breaking with type-B Goldstone modes, a high degree of degeneracy arises in the ground state manifold. Generically, if this degeneracy is polynomial in system size, then it does not depend on the type of boundary conditions used. However, if there exists an emergent (local) symmetry operation tailored to a specific degenerate ground state, then we show that the degeneracies are exponential in system size and are different under periodic boundary conditions (PBCs) and open boundary conditions (OBCs). We further show that the exponential ground state degeneracies in turn imply the emergence of Goldstone flat bands -- single-mode excitations generated by a multi-site operator and its images under the repeated action of the translation operation under PBCs or the cyclic permutation symmetry operation under OBCs. Conversely, we also show that the presence of emergent Goldstone flat bands implies that there exists an emergent (local) symmetry operation tailored to a specific degenerate ground state. In addition, we propose an extrinsic characterization of emergent Goldstone flat bands, revealing a connection to quantum many-body scars, which violate the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis. We illustrate this by presenting examples from the staggered ${\rm SU}(4)$ spin-1 ferromagnetic biquadratic model and the staggered ${\rm SU}(4)$ ferromagnetic spin-orbital model. We also perform extensive numerical simulations for the more general ${\rm SO}(3)$ spin-1 bilinear-biquadratic and ${\rm SO(4)}$ ferromagnetic spin-orbital models, containing the two aforementioned models as the endpoints in the ferromagnetic regimes respectively, and confirm the emergence of Goldstone flat bands, as we approach these endpoints from deep inside the ferromagnetic regimes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14605'&gt;arXiv:2502.14605&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 20 Feb 2025 14:42:07 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

Arovas, Claudio Chamon, Christopher Mudry&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Interpolating between distinct symmetry-enriched critical points is believed to require going through either a multicritical point or an intervening gapped phase. We present a scenario, in which a gapless extended phase serves as a "hub" connecting multiple symmetry-enriched deconfined quantum critical points. As a concrete example, we construct a lattice model with $\mathbb{Z}^{\,}_{2}\times \mathbb{Z}^{\,}_{2}\times \mathbb{Z}^{\,}_{2}$ symmetry for quantum spin-1/2 degrees of freedom that realizes four distinct gapful phases supporting antiferromagnetic long-range order and one extended incommensurate gapless ferromagnetic phase. The quantum phase transition between any two of the four gapped and antiferromagnetic phases goes through either a (deconfined) quantum critical point, a quantum tricritical point, or the incommensurate gapless ferromagnetic phase. In this phase diagram, it is possible to interpolate between four deconfined quantum critical points by passing through the extended gapless ferromagnetic phase. We identify the phases in the model and the nature of the transitions between them through a combination of analytical arguments and density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) studies.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14958'&gt;arXiv:2502.14958&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 20 Feb 2025 19:00:03 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

Romero, András Grabarits, Pranav Chandarana, Enrique Solano, Adolfo del Campo, Narendra N. Hegade&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We experimentally demonstrate that a digitized counterdiabatic quantum protocol reduces the number of topological defects created during a fast quench across a quantum phase transition. To show this, we perform quantum simulations of one- and two-dimensional transverse-field Ising models driven from the paramagnetic to the ferromagnetic phase. We utilize superconducting cloud-based quantum processors with up to 156 qubits. Our data reveal that the digitized counterdiabatic protocol reduces defect formation by up to 48% in the fast-quench regime -- an improvement hard to achieve through digitized quantum annealing under current noise levels. The experimental results closely match theoretical and numerical predictions at short evolution times, before deviating at longer times due to hardware noise. In one dimension, we derive an analytic solution for the defect number distribution in the fast-quench limit. For two-dimensional geometries, where analytical solutions are unknown and numerical simulations are challenging, we use advanced matrix-product-state methods. Our findings indicate a practical way to control the topological defect formation during fast quenches and highlight the utility of counterdiabatic protocols for quantum optimization and quantum simulation in material design on current quantum processors.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15100'&gt;arXiv:2502.15100&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 20 Feb 2025 23:43:04 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Optimization of path-integral tensor-multiplication schemes in open quantum systems</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15136</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; L. M. J. Hall, A. Gisdakis, E. A. Muljarov&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Path-integral techniques are a powerful tool used in open quantum systems to provide an exact solution for the non-Markovian dynamics. However, the exponential scaling of the tensor size with quantum memory length of these techniques limits the applicability when applied to systems with long memory times. Here we provide a general optimization of tensor multiplication schemes for systems with pair correlations and finite memory times. This optimization effectively reduces the tensor sizes by using a matrix representation of tensors combined with singular value decomposition to filter out negligible contributions. This approach dramatically reduces both computational time and memory usage of the traditional tensor-multiplication schemes. Calculations that would require over 50 million GB of RAM in the original approach are now available on standard computers, allowing access to new regimes and more complex systems. While more memory-efficient representations exist, this approach enables an extrapolation scheme that other techniques do not offer. As a demonstration, we apply it to the Trotter decomposition with linked cluster expansion technique, and use it to investigate a quantum dot-microcavity system at larger coupling strengths than previously achieved. We also apply the optimization in a case where the memory time is very long -- specifically in a system containing two spatially separated quantum dots in a common phonon bath.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15136'&gt;arXiv:2502.15136&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 21 Feb 2025 01:32:31 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Entanglement corner dependence in two-dimensional systems: A tensor network perspective</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15467</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Noa Feldman, Moshe Goldstein&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; In continuous quantum field theories, the entanglement entropy of a subsystem with sharp corners in its boundary exhibits a universal corner-dependent contribution. We study this contribution via the lens of discretized systems, and demonstrate that this corner dependence emerges naturally from the geometric structure of infinite projected entangled pair states (iPEPS) on discrete lattices. Using a rigorous counting argument, we show that the bond dimension of an iPEPS representation exhibits a corner-dependent term that matches the predicted term in gapped continuous systems. Crucially, we find that this correspondence only emerges when averaging over all possible lattice orientations, revealing a fundamental requirement for properly discretizing continuous systems. Our results provide a geometric understanding of entanglement corner laws and establish a direct connection between analytical field theory predictions and the structure of tensor network representations. We extend our analysis to gauge-invariant systems, where lattice corners crossed by the bipartition boundary contribute an additional corner-dependent term. These findings offer new insights into the relationship between entanglement in continuous and discrete quantum systems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15467'&gt;arXiv:2502.15467&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 21 Feb 2025 13:47:11 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>A comprehensive study of out-of-equilibrium Kondo effect and Coulomb blockade</title>

We use a high order perturbative expansion in power of the interaction $U$, coupled to a cross-extrapolation method to long time and large interaction. The perturbative series is computed up to $20-25$ orders, using tensor cross-interpolation. We calculate the full Coulomb diamond bias voltage - gate voltage map, including its Kondo ridge, that forms the standard experimental signature of the Coulomb blockage and the Kondo effect. We present current-voltage characteristics that spans three orders of magnitude in bias voltage and display five different regimes of interest from probing the Kondo resonance at small bias to saturation at very high bias. Our technique also naturally produces time-resolved interaction quenches which we use to study the dynamics of the formation of the Kondo cloud. Finally, we predict several qualitatively new physical features that should be within reach of existing or upcoming experiments.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16306'&gt;arXiv:2502.16306&lt;/a&gt;] Published Sat, 22 Feb 2025 17:31:30 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Quantum Encoding of Structured Data with Matrix Product States</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16464</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Josh Green, Jingbo B Wang&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Quantum computing faces a fundamental challenge: the amplitude encoding of an arbitrary n-qubit state vector generally requires {\Omega}(2n) gate operations. We can, however, form dimensionality-reduced representations of quantum states using matrix product states (MPS), providing a promising pathway to the efficient amplitude encoding of states with limited entanglement entropy. In this paper, we explore the capabilities of MPS representations to encode a wide range of functions and images using O(n)-depth circuits without any ancilla qubits, computed with the so-called Matrix Product Disentangler algorithm with tensor network optimisation. We find that MPS-based state preparation enables the efficient encoding of functions up to low-degree piecewise polynomials with accuracy exceeding 99.99% accuracy. We also showcase a novel approach to encoding structured image data based on MPS approximations of the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) representation, which is shown to prepare a 128x128 ChestMNIST image on 14 qubits with fidelity exceeding 99.1% on a circuit with a total depth of just 425 single-qubit rotation and two-qubit CNOT gates.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16464'&gt;arXiv:2502.16464&lt;/a&gt;] Published Sun, 23 Feb 2025 06:47:22 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Spin-charge Kondo effect for a quantum dot with side coupled Majorana zero mode</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16640</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Haojie Shen, Wei Su, Mengnan Chen, Xiaoqun Wang&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We investigate a minimal system consisting of a quantum dot coupled to a Majorana zero mode and a normal lead. We identify the underlying screening process as a novel spin-charge Kondo effect, where the low-energy spin and charge degrees of freedom of the Majorana zero mode-quantum dot subsystem are fully screened by those in the normal lead, resulting in the formation of a spin-charge singlet. An effective low-energy model is derived, with charge fluctuations appropriately accounted for. This spin-charge Kondo effect is found to be consistent with the spin-dependent Andreev/normal boundary conditions induced by the Majorana zero mode. We demonstrate that the anomalous substructure in the spectrum and thermodynamic properties is closely tied to the proportion of the charge component in the screening cloud. The spin-charge screening cloud exhibits scaling behavior analogous to that of traditional Kondo systems, though the sub-leading even-odd effect is subtly modified by the boundary conditions. These findings enhance our understanding of Kondo physics and resolve key debates on quantum dot nanostructures with Majorana zero modes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16640'&gt;arXiv:2502.16640&lt;/a&gt;] Published Sun, 23 Feb 2025 16:32:08 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Phase coherence of charge-$6e$ superconductors via a frustrated Kagome XY antiferromagnet</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17005</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Feng-Feng Song, Guang-Ming Zhang&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Recent experimental evidence for the charge-$6e$ condensed phase in kagome superconductors has generated significant interest. We investigate the unconventional superconductivity in the kagome superconductor $\mathrm{CsV_3Sb_5}$, focusing on the emergence of charge-$6e$ superconductivity (SC) at temperatures higher than the conventional charge-$2e$ SC state. By modeling the phase coherence of the SC order parameter using a frustrated antiferromagnetic XY model on an emergent kagome lattice, we show that the condensation of fractional vortices with $1/3$ vorticity stabilizes phase coherence in $\exp(i3\theta)$, giving rise to the charge-$6e$ SC state. Using a tensor network approach tailored for frustrated spin systems, we identify a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition at $T_c/J \simeq 0.075$, where the unbinding of $1/3$ fractional vortex-antivortex pairs transforms the system from the charge-$6e$ SC phase to the normal phase. Below $T_c$, the $1/3$ fractional vortex correlations exhibit power-law decay, while the integer vortex correlations decay exponentially, reflecting the dominance of charge-$6e$ SC in the absence of charge-$2e$ SC. Our results provide a theoretical understanding of the charge-$6e$ SC in two-dimensional kagome superconductors, emphasizing the interplay between fractional vortices, frustration, and topology in stabilizing this exotic SC phase.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17005'&gt;arXiv:2502.17005&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 24 Feb 2025 09:36:35 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; João Barata, Enrique Rico&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; In analogy to high-energy nuclear scattering experiments, we study a real-time scattering process between a propagating state and a dense target in $1+1$-d massive QED. In our setup, we identify three distinct regimes that qualitatively characterize the evolution: for a dilute medium, the incoming probe state evolves nearly ballistically; in an intermediate setting, it traverses the matter, locally exciting it; and for dense targets, one approaches a black-disk limit, where the matter acts as a strong wall potential. We find evidence that the probe's energy loss rate scales linearly with the path length in the medium, and we study how the entanglement entropy reveals the mixing between the probe and medium states. With the goal of one day replicating high-energy nuclear experiments in quantum devices, we briefly discuss how the current tensor network-based simulations can be translated to a quantum simulator.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17558'&gt;arXiv:2502.17558&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 24 Feb 2025 19:00:01 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Using Matrix-Free Tensor-Network Optimizations to Construct a Reduced-Scaling and Robust Second-Order Møller-Plesset Theory</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17683</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Karl Pierce, Miguel Morales&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We investigate the efficient combination of the canonical polyadic decomposition (CPD) and tensor hyper-contraction (THC) approaches. We first present a novel low-cost CPD solver which leverages a precomputed THC factorization of an order-$4$ tensor to efficiently optimize the order-$4$ CPD with $\mathcal{O}(NR^2)$ scaling. With the matrix-free THC-based optimization strategy in hand we can: efficiently generate CPD factorizations of the order-4 two-electron integral tensors; and develop novel electronic structure methods which take advantage of both the THC and CPD approximations. Next, we investigate the application of a combined CPD and THC approximation of the Laplace transform (LT) second-order M{\o}ller-Plesset (MP2) method. We exploit the ability to switch efficiently between the THC and CPD factorizations of the two electron integrals to reduce the computational complexity of the LT MP2 method while preserving the accuracy of the approach. Furthermore we take advantage of the robust fitting approximation to eliminate leading order error in the CPD approximated tensor networks. Finally, we show that modest values of THC and CPD rank preserve the accuracy of the LT MP2 method and that this CPD+THC LT MP2 strategy realizes a performance advantage over canonical LT MP2 in both computational wall-times and memory resource requirements.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17683'&gt;arXiv:2502.17683&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 24 Feb 2025 22:06:02 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Model-Free Adversarial Purification via Coarse-To-Fine Tensor Network Representation</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17972</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Guang Lin, Duc Thien Nguyen, Zerui Tao, Konstantinos Slavakis, Toshihisa Tanaka, Qibin Zhao&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Deep neural networks are known to be vulnerable to well-designed adversarial attacks. Although numerous defense strategies have been proposed, many are tailored to the specific attacks or tasks and often fail to generalize across diverse scenarios. In this paper, we propose Tensor Network Purification (TNP), a novel model-free adversarial purification method by a specially designed tensor network decomposition algorithm. TNP depends neither on the pre-trained generative model nor the specific dataset, resulting in strong robustness across diverse adversarial scenarios. To this end, the key challenge lies in relaxing Gaussian-noise assumptions of classical decompositions and accommodating the unknown distribution of adversarial perturbations. Unlike the low-rank representation of classical decompositions, TNP aims to reconstruct the unobserved clean examples from an adversarial example. Specifically, TNP leverages progressive downsampling and introduces a novel adversarial optimization objective to address the challenge of minimizing reconstruction error but without inadvertently restoring adversarial perturbations. Extensive experiments conducted on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet demonstrate that our method generalizes effectively across various norm threats, attack types, and tasks, providing a versatile and promising adversarial purification technique.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17972'&gt;arXiv:2502.17972&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 25 Feb 2025 08:45:50 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Quantum entanglement of fermionic symmetry-enriched quantum critical points in one dimension</title>

Recently, the notion of nontrivial topology in critical systems has been proposed and is attracting growing attention. In this work, as a concrete example, we explore the quantum entanglement properties of fermionic symmetry-enriched quantum critical points by constructing exactly solvable models based on stacked multiple Kitaev chains. We first analytically establish the global phase diagram using entanglement entropy and reveal three topologically distinct gapped phases with different winding numbers, along with three topologically distinct transition lines separating them. Importantly, we unambiguously demonstrate that two transition lines exhibit fundamentally different topological properties despite sharing the same central charge. Specifically, they display nontrivial topological degeneracy in the entanglement spectrum under periodic boundary conditions, thereby generalizing the Li-Haldane bulk-boundary correspondence to a broader class of fermionic symmetry-enriched criticality. Additionally, we identify a novel Lifshitz multicritical point at the intersection of the three transition lines, which also exhibits nontrivial topological degeneracy. This work provides a valuable reference for investigating gapless topological phases of matter from the perspective of quantum entanglement.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18178'&gt;arXiv:2502.18178&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 25 Feb 2025 13:11:34 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

By design, it protects density operator positivity and provides direct access to entanglement monotones, such as entanglement of formation and logarithmic negativity. To demonstrate the framework's ability to probe entanglement in open quantum many-body systems and distinguish it from other correlations, we study a paradigmatic open system problem: the boundary-driven XXZ spin-chain. We uncover entanglement transitions driven by both the coupling to the environment and the anisotropy parameter. These transitions reveal an immediate connection between entanglement and spin-current, and link the known transport regimes of the model to distinct entanglement regimes, i.e., separable, area-law, and volume-law. Our work enables the analysis of entanglement in open quantum many-body systems out of equilibrium, a necessary step for developing scalable quantum technologies.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18372'&gt;arXiv:2502.18372&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 25 Feb 2025 17:09:13 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

Mendl&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; This research introduces an improved framework for constructing matrix product operators (MPOs) and tree tensor network operators (TTNOs), crucial tools in quantum simulations. A given (Hamiltonian) operator typically has a known symbolic "sum of operator strings" form that can be translated into a tensor network structure. Combining the existing bipartite-graph-based approach and a newly introduced symbolic Gaussian elimination preprocessing step, our proposed method improves upon earlier algorithms in cases when Hamiltonian terms share the same prefactors. We test the performance of our method against established ones for benchmarking purposes. Finally, we apply our methodology to the model of a cavity filled with molecules in a solvent. This open quantum system is cast into the hierarchical equation of motion (HEOM) setting to obtain an effective Hamiltonian. Construction of the corresponding TTNO demonstrates a sub-linear increase of the maximum bond dimension.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18630'&gt;arXiv:2502.18630&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 25 Feb 2025 20:33:30 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

Recent experimental work on Li-doped CrSBr reveals quasi-1D charge modulated states. In this study, we develop ab initio effective models for CrSBr to investigate these states and solve them using mean-field theory and density matrix embedding theory. The models are parametrized using density functional theory, the constrained random phase approximation, and the Rytova-Keldysh form of the long-range Coulomb interaction. Our simulations indicate the emergence of a charge density wave state characterized by cosine-like intra-chain density modulations and inter-chain phase shifts that minimize the Coulomb repulsion. Notably, at a doping level corresponding to $1/n$ electron per CrSBr unit, the most stable pattern exhibits a periodicity of $n$ cells, in agreement with experimental observations and Peierls' instability arguments. Moreover, we demonstrate that the inter-chain order is sensitive to the range of Coulomb interactions. If the interaction is hard-truncated to a short-ranged form, some localized stripe-like states are computationally favored. This work provides an ab initio framework for understanding the interplay of competing electronic and magnetic phases in CrSBr and related materials.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18649'&gt;arXiv:2502.18649&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 25 Feb 2025 21:18:55 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

Herdman, Arpan Biswas, Bernd Rosenow, Adrian Del Maestro&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We present a controlled numerical study of the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition in the one-dimensional Bose-Hubbard model at unit filling, providing evidence of the characteristic logarithmic finite-size scaling of the BKT transition. Employing density matrix renormalization group and quantum Monte Carlo simulations under periodic boundary conditions, together with a systematic finite-size scaling analysis of bipartite particle number fluctuations, we resolve boundary-induced complications that previously obscured critical scaling. We demonstrate that a suitably chosen central region under open boundaries reproduces universal RG signatures, reconciling earlier discrepancies. Finally, leveraging a non-parametric Bayesian analysis, we determine the critical interaction strength with high precision, establishing a benchmark for BKT physics in one-dimensional quantum models.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18622'&gt;arXiv:2502.18622&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 25 Feb 2025 20:11:24 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Oddities in the Entanglement Scaling of the Quantum Six-Vertex Model</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19152</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Sunny Pradhan, Jesús Cobos, Enrique Rico, Germán Sierra&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We investigate the entanglement properties of the Quantum Six-Vertex Model on a cylinder, focusing on the Shannon-Renyi entropy in the limit of Renyi order $n = \infty$. This entropy, calculated from the ground state amplitudes of the equivalent XXZ spin-1/2 chain, allows us to determine the Renyi entanglement entropy of the corresponding Rokhsar-Kivelson wavefunctions, which describe the ground states of certain conformal quantum critical points. Our analysis reveals a novel logarithmic correction to the expected entanglement scaling when the system size is odd. This anomaly arises from the geometric frustration of spin configurations imposed by periodic boundary conditions on odd-sized chains. We demonstrate that the scaling prefactor of this logarithmic term is directly related to the compactification radius of the low-energy bosonic field theory description, or equivalently, the Luttinger parameter. Thus, this correction provides a direct probe of the underlying Conformal Field Theory (CFT) describing the critical point. Our findings highlight the crucial role of system size parity in determining the entanglement properties of this model and offer insights into the interplay between geometry, frustration, and criticality.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19152'&gt;arXiv:2502.19152&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 26 Feb 2025 14:09:40 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Dynamical cluster-based optimization of tensor network algorithms for quantum circuit simulations</title>

We introduce a variation of the standard TEBD algorithm, we termed "cluster-TEBD", which dynamically arranges qubits into entanglement clusters, enabling the exact contraction of multiple circuit layers in a single time step. Moreover, we enhance the DMRG algorithm by introducing an adaptive protocol which analyzes the entanglement distribution within each circuit section to be contracted, dynamically adjusting the qubit grouping at each iteration. We analyze the performances of these enhanced algorithms in simulating both stabilizer and non-stabilizer random circuits, with up to $1000$ qubits and $100$ layers of Clifford and non-Clifford gates, and in simulating Shor's quantum algorithm with tens of thousands of layers. Our findings show that, even with reasonable computational resources per task, cluster-based approaches can significantly speed up simulations of large-sized quantum circuits and improve the fidelity of the final states.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19289'&gt;arXiv:2502.19289&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 26 Feb 2025 16:49:11 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Probing Green's Function Zeros by Co-tunneling through Mott Insulators</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Carl Lehmann, Lorenzo Crippa, Giorgio Sangiovanni, Jan Carl Budich&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Quantum tunneling experiments have provided deep insights into basic excitations occurring as Green's function poles in the realm of complex quantum matter. However, strongly correlated quantum materials also allow for Green's functions zeros (GFZ) that may be seen as an antidote to the familiar poles, and have so far largely eluded direct experimental study. Here, we propose and investigate theoretically how co-tunneling through Mott insulators enables direct access to the shadow band structure of GFZ. In particular, we derive an effective Hamiltonian for the GFZ that is shown to govern the co-tunneling amplitude and reveal fingerprints of many-body correlations clearly distinguishing the GFZ structure from the underlying free Bloch band structure of the system. Our perturbative analytical results are corroborated by numerical data both in the framework of exact diagonalization and matrix product state simulations for a one-dimensional model system consisting of a Su-Schrieffer-Heeger-Hubbard model coupled to two single level quantum dots.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19479'&gt;arXiv:2502.19479&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 26 Feb 2025 19:00:01 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Long-range nonstabilizerness and phases of matter</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19504</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; David Aram Korbany, Michael J. Gullans, Lorenzo Piroli&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Long-range nonstabilizerness can be defined as the amount of nonstabilizerness which cannot be removed by shallow local quantum circuits. In this work, we study long-range nonstabilizerness in the context of many-body quantum physics, a task with possible implications for quantum-state preparation protocols and implementation of quantum-error correcting codes. After presenting a simple argument showing that long-range nonstabilizerness is a generic property of many-body states, we restrict to the class of ground states of gapped local Hamiltonians. We focus on one-dimensional systems and present rigorous results in the context of translation-invariant matrix product states (MPSs). By analyzing the fixed points of the MPS renormalization-group flow, we provide a sufficient condition for long-range nonstabilizerness, which depends entirely on the local MPS tensors. Physically, our condition captures the fact that the mutual information between distant regions of stabilizer fixed points is quantized, and this fact is not changed after applying shallow quantum circuits. We also discuss possible ramifications in the classification of phases of matter and quantum error correction.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19504'&gt;arXiv:2502.19504&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 26 Feb 2025 19:11:47 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>An Analysis of First- and Quasi-Second-Order Optimization Algorithms in Variational Monte Carlo</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19576</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Ruojing Peng, Garnet Kin-Lic Chan&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Many quantum many-body wavefunctions, such as Jastrow-Slater, tensor network, and neural quantum states, are studied with the variational Monte Carlo technique, where stochastic optimization is usually performed to obtain a faithful approximation to the ground-state of a given Hamiltonian. While first-order gradient descent methods are commonly used for such optimizations, quasi-second-order optimization formulations offer the potential of faster convergence under certain theoretical conditions, but with a similar cost per sample to first-order methods. However, the relative performance of first-order and second-order optimizers is influenced in practice by many factors, including the sampling requirements for a faithful optimization step, the influence of wavefunction quality, as well as the wavefunction parametrization and expressivity. Here we analyze these performance characteristics of first-order and quasi-second-order optimization methods for a variety of Hamiltonians, with the additional context of understanding the scaling of these methods (for good performance) as a function of system size. Our findings help clarify the role of first-order and quasi-second-order methods in variational Monte Carlo calculations and the conditions under which they should respectively be used. In particular, we find that unlike in deterministic optimization, where closeness to the variational minimum determines the suitability of second-order methods, in stochastic optimization the main factor is the overall expressivity of the wavefunction: quasi-second-order methods lead to an overall reduction in cost relative to first-order methods when the wavefunction is sufficiently expressive to represent the ground-state, even when starting far away from the ground state. This makes quasi-second-order methods an important technique when used with wavefunctions with arbitrarily improvable accuracy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19576'&gt;arXiv:2502.19576&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 26 Feb 2025 21:38:47 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Inexact subspace projection methods for low-rank tensor eigenvalue problems</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19578</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Alec Dektor, Peter DelMastro, Erika Ye, Roel Van Beeumen, Chao Yang&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We compare two approaches for solving high-dimensional eigenvalue problems with low-rank structure: the inexact Lanczos method and inexact polynomial-filtered subspace iteration. Inexactness stems from low-rank compression, enabling efficient representation of high-dimensional vectors in a low-rank tensor format. A primary challenge in these methods is that standard operations, such as matrix-vector products and linear combinations, increase tensor rank, necessitating rank truncation and hence approximation. The Lanczos method constructs an approximate orthonormal Krylov basis, which is often difficult to represent accurately using low-rank tensor formats, even when the eigenvectors themselves exhibit low-rank structure. In contrast, the low-rank polynomial-filtered subspace iteration uses approximate eigenvectors (Ritz vectors) directly as a subspace basis, bypassing the need for an orthonormal Krylov basis. Our analysis and numerical experiments demonstrate that inexact subspace iteration is much more robust to rank-truncation errors compared to the inexact Lanczos method. We further demonstrate that rank-truncated subspace iteration can converge for problems where the density matrix renormalization group method (DMRG) stagnates.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19578'&gt;arXiv:2502.19578&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 26 Feb 2025 21:41:18 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Quantitative Description of Strongly Correlated Materials by Combining Downfolding Techniques and Tensor Networks</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19588</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Daan Vrancken, Simon Ganne, Daan Verraes, Tom Braeckevelt, Lukas Devos, Laurens Vanderstraeten, Jutho Haegeman, Veronique Van Speybroeck&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We present a high-accuracy procedure for electronic structure calculations of strongly correlated materials. To address limitations in current electronic structure methods, we employ density functional theory in combination with the constrained random phase approximation to construct an effective multi-band Hubbard model, which is subsequently solved using tensor networks. Our work focuses on one-dimensional and quasi-one-dimensional materials, for which we employ the machinery of matrix product states. We apply this framework to the conjugated polymers trans-polyacetylene and polythiophene, as well as the quasi-one-dimensional charge-transfer insulator Sr2CuO3. The predicted band gaps show quantitative agreement with state-of-the-art computational techniques and experimental measurements. Beyond band gaps, tensor networks provide access to a wide range of physically relevant properties, including spin magnetization and various excitation energies. Their flexibility supports the implementation of complex Hamiltonians with longer-range interactions, while the bond dimension enables systematic control over accuracy. Furthermore, the computational cost scales efficiently with system size, demonstrating the framework's scalability.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19588'&gt;arXiv:2502.19588&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 26 Feb 2025 22:02:08 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Frobenius subalgebra lattices in tensor categories</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Mainak Ghosh, Sebastien Palcoux&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; This paper studies Frobenius subalgebra posets in abelian monoidal categories and shows that, under general conditions--satisfied in all semisimple tensor categories over the complex field--they collapse to lattices through a rigidity invariance perspective. Based on this, we extend Watatani's finiteness theorem for intermediate subfactors by proving that, under a weak positivity assumption--met by all semisimple tensor categories over the complex field--and a compatibility condition--fulfilled by all pivotal ones--the lattices arising from connected Frobenius algebras are finite. We also derive a non-semisimple version via semisimplification. Our approach relies on the concept of a formal angle, and the extension of key results--such as the planar algebraic exchange relation and Landau's theorems--to linear monoidal categories. Major applications of our findings include a stronger version of the Ino-Watatani result: we show that the finiteness of intermediate C*-algebras holds in a finite-index unital irreducible inclusion of C*-algebras without requiring the simple assumption. Moreover, for a finite-dimensional semisimple Hopf algebra H, we prove that H* is a Frobenius algebra object in Rep(H) and has a finite number of rigid invariant Frobenius subalgebras. Finally, we explore a range of applications, including abstract spin chains, vertex operator algebras, algebraic geometry and speculations on quantum arithmetic involving the generalization of Ore's theorem, Euler's totient and sigma functions, and RH.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19876'&gt;arXiv:2502.19876&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 27 Feb 2025 08:33:10 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

From a quantum information perspective, the fingerprint of this phenomenon is the logarithmic growth of the entanglement entropy over time. We perform intensive numerical simulations, applied to a paradigmatic model system, showing that the local ergotropy, the maximum extractable work via local unitary operations on a small subsystem in the presence of Hamiltonian coupling, dynamically witnesses the change from ergodic to localized phases. Within the many-body localized phase, both the local ergotropy and its quantum fluctuations slowly vary over time with a characteristic logarithmic law analogous to the behaviour of entanglement entropy. This showcases how directly leveraging local control, instead of local observables or entropies analyzed in previous works, provides a thermodynamic marker of localization phenomena based on the locally extractable work.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20002'&gt;arXiv:2502.20002&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 27 Feb 2025 11:29:06 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Simulating Bulk Gap in Chiral Projected Entangled-Pair States</title>

Here, we address this challenge and demonstrate that PEPS can reliably characterize gapped bulk excitations in chiral topological phases. Using a variational principle for excited states within a local mode approximation, we establish that correlation functions decaying faster than $r^{-2}$ are not necessarily related to gapless modes and thus long-range ``gossamer'' correlation tails in chiral PEPS do not contradict the presence of a bulk gap. This framework is validated in the spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ Kitaev model with a chiral term, where PEPS yields excitation gaps that agree well with exact solutions. Extending our approach to the $\mathbb{Z}_3$ Kitaev model, we present compelling evidence for its chiral ground state and accurately resolve its gapped excitations. These findings thus solidify PEPS as a powerful tool for studying both ground and excited states in chiral topological systems, thereby bridging a key gap in the understanding of their bulk properties.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20142'&gt;arXiv:2502.20142&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 27 Feb 2025 14:34:02 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

The tensor networks constructed are one dimension higher than the lattices of the physical systems, allowing entangled physical degrees of freedoms to be paired with one another arbitrarily far away. Contraction rules of the internal legs are specified by a simple translationally invariant set of rules in terms of the tesselation of cubes or prisms in 3D space. The networks directly generalize the previous holographic tensor networks for 1D Fredkin and Motzkin chains. We also analyze the correlation in the spin and color sectors from the scaling of the height function of random surfaces, revealing additional characterizations of the exotic phase transitions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20192'&gt;arXiv:2502.20192&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 27 Feb 2025 15:28:12 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Adrián Franco-Rubio, Arkadiusz Bochniak, J. Ignacio Cirac&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; In this work, we examine the consequences of the existence of a finite group of matrix product unitary (MPU) symmetries for matrix product states (MPS). We generalize the well-understood picture of onsite unitary symmetries, which give rise to virtual symmetry defects given by insertions of operators in the bonds of the MPS. In the MPU case, we can define analogous defect tensors, this time sitting on lattice sites, that can be created, moved, and fused by local unitary operators. We leverage this formalism to study the gauging of MPU symmetries. We introduce a condition, block independence, under which we can gauge the symmetries by promoting the symmetry defects to gauge degrees of freedom, yielding an MPS of the same bond dimension that supports a local version of the symmetry given by commuting gauge constraints. Whenever block independence does not hold (which happens, in particular, whenever the symmetry representation is anomalous), a modification of our method which we call state-level gauging still gives rise to a locally symmetric MPS by promotion of the symmetry defects, at the expense of producing gauge constraints that do not commute on different sites.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20257'&gt;arXiv:2502.20257&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 27 Feb 2025 16:45:33 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Anticoncentration in Clifford Circuits and Beyond: From Random Tensor Networks to Pseudo-Magic States</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20455</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Beatrice Magni, Alexios Christopoulos, Andrea De Luca, Xhek Turkeshi&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Anticoncentration describes how an ensemble of quantum states spreads over the allowed Hilbert space, leading to statistically uniform output probability distributions. In this work, we investigate the anticoncentration of random Clifford circuits toward the overlap distribution of random stabilizer states. Using exact analytical techniques and extensive numerical simulations based on Clifford replica tensor networks, we demonstrate that random Clifford circuits fully anticoncentrate in logarithmic circuit depth, namely higher-order moments of the overlap distribution converge to those of random stabilizer states. Moreover, we investigate the effect of introducing a controlled number of non-Clifford (magic) resources into Clifford circuits. We show that inserting a polylogarithmic in qudit number of $T$-states is sufficient to drive the overlap distribution toward the Porter-Thomas statistics, effectively recovering full quantum randomness. In short, this fact presents doped tensor networks and shallow Clifford circuits as pseudo-magic quantum states. Our results clarify the interplay between Clifford dynamics, magic resource injection, and quantum complexity, with implications for quantum circuit sampling and benchmarking of computational quantum advantage.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20455'&gt;arXiv:2502.20455&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 27 Feb 2025 19:00:29 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Wavelet-based density sketching with functional hierarchical tensor</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20655</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Xun Tang, Lexing Ying&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We introduce the functional hierarchical tensor under a wavelet basis (FHT-W) ansatz for high-dimensional density estimation in lattice models. Recently, the functional tensor network has emerged as a suitable candidate for density estimation due to its ability to calculate the normalization constant exactly, a defining feature not enjoyed by neural network alternatives such as energy-based models or diffusion models. While current functional tensor network models show good performance for lattice models with weak or moderate couplings, we show that they face significant model capacity constraints when applied to lattice models with strong coupling. To address this issue, this work proposes to perform density estimation on the lattice model under a wavelet transformation. Motivated by the literature on scale separation, we perform iterative wavelet coarsening to separate the lattice model into different scales. Based on this multiscale structure, we design a new functional hierarchical tensor ansatz using a hierarchical tree topology, whereby information on the finer scale is further away from the root node of the tree. Our experiments show that the numerical rank of typical lattice models is significantly lower under appropriate wavelet transformation. Furthermore, we show that our proposed model allows one to model challenging Gaussian field models and Ginzburg-Landau models.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20655'&gt;arXiv:2502.20655&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 28 Feb 2025 02:19:21 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Daniele Oriti&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We summarize basic features of quantum gravity states and processes, common to a number of related quantum gravity formalisms, and sharing a purely combinatorial and algebraic language, and a discrete geometric interpretation. We emphasize how, in this context, entanglement is a seed of topological and geometric properties, and how a pre-geometric, discrete notion of quantum causality can be implemented, as well as some recent results (based on random tensor network techniques) on the conditions for information transmission and holographic behaviour in quantum gravity states. Together, these features indicate that quantum information concepts and tools play a key role in defining the fundamental structure of quantum spacetime.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21234'&gt;arXiv:2502.21234&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 28 Feb 2025 17:03:09 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Universality in the Anticoncentration of Chaotic Quantum Circuits</title>

We support this claim through analytical results for ensembles of random tensor-network states and random-phase models. This compact, universal expression for the output bitstring probability distribution is fully characterized by just two fitting parameters, as validated through extensive numerical simulations. Our findings underscore the pivotal role of finite-size and finite-depth effects in shaping anticoncentration and introduce a practical framework for benchmarking quantum devices using shallow circuits, thereby enabling validation of systems significantly larger than previously accessible.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00119'&gt;arXiv:2503.00119&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 28 Feb 2025 19:00:26 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Generating Generalised Ground-State Ansatzes from Few-Body Examples</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00497</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Matt Lourens, Ilya Sinayskiy, Johannes N. Kriel, Francesco Petruccione&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We introduce a method that generates ground-state ansatzes for quantum many-body systems which are both analytically tractable and accurate over wide parameter regimes. Our approach leverages a custom symbolic language to construct tensor network states (TNS) via an evolutionary algorithm. This language provides operations that allow the generated TNS to automatically scale with system size. Consequently, we can evaluate ansatz fitness for small systems, which is computationally efficient, while favouring structures that continue to perform well with increasing system size. This ensures that the ansatz captures robust features of the ground state structure. Remarkably, we find analytically tractable ansatzes with a degree of universality, which encode correlations, capture finite-size effects, accurately predict ground-state energies, and offer a good description of critical phenomena. We demonstrate this method on the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model (LMG) and the quantum transverse-field Ising model (TFIM), where the same ansatz was independently generated for both. The simple structure of the ansatz allows us to restore broken symmetries and obtain exact expressions for the expectation values of local observables and correlation functions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00497'&gt;arXiv:2503.00497&lt;/a&gt;] Published Sat, 01 Mar 2025 13:52:57 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Correlated hopping induced topological order in an atomic mixture</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00589</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Ashirbad Padhan, Luca Barbiero, Tapan Mishra&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The large majority of topological phases in one dimensional many-body systems are known to inherit from the corresponding single-particle Hamiltonian. In this work, we go beyond this assumption and find a new example of topological order induced through specific interactions couplings. Specifically, we consider a fermionic mixture where one component experiences a staggered onsite potential and it is coupled through density dependent hopping interactions to the other fermionic component. Crucially, by varying the sign of the staggered potential, we show that this latter fermionic component can acquire topological properties. Thanks to matrix product state simulations, we prove this result both at the equilibrium by extracting the behavior of correlation functions and in an out-of-equilibrium scheme by employing a Thouless charge pumping. Notably, we further discuss how our results can be probed in quantum simulators made up of ultracold atoms. Our results reveal an important and alternative mechanism that can give rise to topological order.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00589'&gt;arXiv:2503.00589&lt;/a&gt;] Published Sat, 01 Mar 2025 19:01:14 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Compactifying Electronic Wavefunctions I: Error-Mitigated Transcorrelated DMRG</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00627</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Bruna G. M. Araújo, Antonio M S Macedo&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Transcorrelation (TC) techniques effectively enhance convergence rates in strongly correlated fermionic systems by embedding electron-electron cusp into the Jastrow factor of similarity transformations, yielding a non-Hermitian, yet iso-spectral, Hamiltonian. This non-Hermitian nature introduces significant challenges for variational methods such as the Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG). To address these, existing approaches often rely on computationally expensive methods prone to errors, such as imaginary-time evolution. We introduce an Error-Mitigated Transcorrelated DMRG (EMTC-DMRG), a classical variational algorithm that overcomes these challenges by integrating existing techniques to achieve superior accuracy and efficiency. Key features of our algorithm include: (a) an analytical formulation of the transcorrelated Fermi-Hubbard Hamiltonian; (b) a numerically exact, uncompressed Matrix Product Operator (MPO) representation developed via symbolic optimization and the Hopcroft-Karp algorithm; and (c) a time-independent DMRG with a two-site sweep algorithm; (d) we use Davidson solver even for a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. Our method significantly enhances computational efficiency and accuracy in determining ground-state energies for the two-dimensional transcorrelated Fermi-Hubbard model with periodic boundary conditions. Additionally, it can be adapted to compute both ground and excited states in molecular systems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00627'&gt;arXiv:2503.00627&lt;/a&gt;] Published Sat, 01 Mar 2025 21:34:00 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Phase diagram of a coupled trimer system at half filling using the Hubbard model</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02278</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Sourabh Saha, Hosho Katsura, Manoranjan Kumar&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Flat band systems have recently attracted significant attention due to their instability under small perturbations, which can lead to the stabilization of many exotic quantum phases. We study a trimer ladder which shows a middle flat band in the absence of onsite Coulomb interaction. We investigate the quantum phases of the Hubbard model on this geometry using exact diagonalization (ED), density matrix renormalization group (DMRG), and perturbation theory. We construct a quantum phase diagram in the plane of the next-nearest-neighbor hopping parameter $t_2$ and onsite Coulomb interaction $U$, revealing five distinct quantum phases. At low $U$ and moderate to high magnitude of $t_2$, the system exhibits metallic behavior, while at large $U$ and small magnitude of $t_2$, it transitions to a ferrimagnetic insulator phase, similar to those observed in certain trimer materials. In the small $t_2$ limit, the Fermi energy is in the flat band, leading to localization of the electrons within the trimer. At low $U$ and small magnitude of $t_2$, the flat band mechanism favors insulating ferrimagnetism, whereas at large $U$, ferrimagnetic states emerge from singlet dimer formation between neighboring sites of a trimer and an isolated corner spin, which connect ferromagnetically. The insulating cell spin density wave phase displays an up-up-down-down spin configuration due to competing nearest neighbor hopping, $t_1$. Interestingly, in moderate $U$ and $|t_2|&gt;0.3$, the ground state behaves like metallic Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02278'&gt;arXiv:2503.02278&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 04 Mar 2025 05:02:25 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Meson dynamics from locally exciting a particle-conserving $Z_2$ lattice gauge theory</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Vaibhav Sharma, Kaden R. A. Hazzard&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Quantum simulation of lattice gauge theories is an important avenue to gain insights into both particle physics phenomena and constrained quantum many-body dynamics. There is a growing interest in probing analogs of high energy collision phenomena in lattice gauge theories that can be implemented on current quantum simulators. Motivated by this, we characterize the confined mesons that originate from a local high energy excitation in a particle-conserving 1D $Z_2$ lattice gauge theory. We focus on a simple, experimentally accessible setting that does not require preparation of colliding wavepackets and isolates the effects of gauge field confinement strength and initial state energy on the nature of propagating excitations. We find that the dynamics is characterized by the propagation of a superposition of differently sized mesons. The linear confinement leads to meson size oscillations in time. The average meson size and oscillation frequency are controlled by the strength of the gauge field confinement. At a constant confinement field, the average meson length is controlled by the initial excitation's energy. Higher energies produce longer mesons and their effective mass depends strongly on their size: longer mesons propagate more slowly out of the central excitation. Mesons of different sizes get spatially filtered with time due to different speeds. We show that this phenomenology is a consequence of linear confinement and remains valid in both the strong and weak confinement limit. We present simple explanations of these phenomena supported by exact numerics.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02791'&gt;arXiv:2503.02791&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 04 Mar 2025 17:09:44 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

In this study, we investigate the $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ spin model on the checkerboard lattice to explore the effects of frustration arising from its point-connected $(N+1)$-site local structure. We employ density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) and exact diagonalization (ED) techniques to determine the ground state properties. Our results reveal the absence of both 3-sublattice antiferromagnetic order and valence cluster solid order. Instead, we identify ground states with bond stripe patterns sensitive to boundary conditions and system size, comprising staggered singlet arrays and uniform flat stripes. Notably, these stripes are relatively decoupled, and similar patterns can be reconstructed in quasi-one-dimensional ladders. These findings suggest that geometric frustration drives the system toward a mixed phase, combining characteristics of spin-liquid and valence cluster solid states, providing new insights into the behavior of frustrated quantum spin systems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02805'&gt;arXiv:2503.02805&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 04 Mar 2025 17:27:43 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

The method yields numerically exact descriptions of metallic states without sharp spectral features, at a moderate numerical cost. Systems with narrow quasiparticle or spin-polaron peaks, as well as low-temperature Mott insulators provide more challenges, since these simulations require long time contours or high bond dimensions. A promising field of application is the DMFT simulation of nonequilibrium steady states, which we demonstrate with results for photo-doped Mott systems with long-lived doublon and holon populations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02848'&gt;arXiv:2503.02848&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 04 Mar 2025 18:24:23 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

Girvin&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We study the ground-state phase diagram of a one-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theory coupled to soft-core bosonic matter at unit filling, inspired by the Higgs sector of the standard model. Through a combination of analytical perturbative approaches, exact diagonalization, and density-matrix-renormalization-group simulations, we uncover a rich phase diagram driven by gauge-field-mediated resonant pair hopping and the confinement of single particles. The pair hopping results in a bunching state with superextensive energy and macroscopic particle number fluctuations at strong electric field strengths and weak on-site interactions. The bunching state crosses over into a pair superfluid phase as the on-site interaction increases, characterized by a finite superfluid density and powerlaw-decaying pair correlations. At large on-site interaction strengths and driven by effective interactions induced by the gauge constraint, the superfluid transitions into an incompressible pair Mott insulator phase. At weak field strengths and on-site interactions, we find a plasma-like region, where single bosons exhibit large short-range correlations and the ground state is composed almost equally of states with even and odd local boson occupation. The presence of a bunching state with large number fluctuations, which is difficult to study using classical numerics, motivates experimental realizations in hybrid boson-qubit quantum simulation platforms such as circuit QED, neutral atoms, and trapped ions. Our findings highlight the rich interplay between gauge fields and soft-core bosonic matter.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03828'&gt;arXiv:2503.03828&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 05 Mar 2025 19:00:07 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Tight and self-testing multipartite quantum Bell inequalities from the renormalization group</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03878</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Paolo Abiuso, Julian Fischer, Miguel Navascués&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; In past work, the concept of connectors was introduced: directed tensors with the property that any contraction thereof defines a multipartite quantum Bell inequality, i.e., a linear restriction on measurement probabilities that holds in any multipartite quantum experiment. In this paper we propose the notion of ''tight connectors'', which, if contracted according to some simple rules, result in tight quantum Bell inequalities. By construction, the new inequalities are saturated by tensor network states, whose structure mimics the corresponding network of connectors. Some tight connectors are furthermore ''fully self-testing'', which implies that the quantum Bell inequalities they generate can only be maximized with such a tensor network state and specific measurement operators (modulo local isometries). We provide large analytic families of tight, fully self-testing connectors that generate $N$-partite quantum Bell inequalities of correlator form for which the ratio between the maximum quantum and classical values increases exponentially with $N$.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03878'&gt;arXiv:2503.03878&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 05 Mar 2025 20:20:56 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Image Computation for Quantum Transition Systems</title>

While model checking is a dominant and very successful technique for verifying classical systems, its application to quantum systems is still an underdeveloped research area. This paper advances the development of model checking quantum systems by providing efficient image computation algorithms for quantum transition systems, which play a fundamental role in model checking. In our approach, we represent quantum circuits as tensor networks and design algorithms by leveraging the properties of tensor networks and tensor decision diagrams. Our experiments demonstrate that our contraction partition-based algorithm can greatly improve the efficiency of image computation for quantum transition systems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04146'&gt;arXiv:2503.04146&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 06 Mar 2025 06:49:49 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Self-consistent tensor network method for correlated super-moiré matter beyond one billion sites</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04373</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Yitao Sun, Marcel Niedermeier, Tiago V. C. Antão, Adolfo O. Fumega, Jose L. Lado&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Moir\'e and super-moir\'e materials provide exceptional platforms to engineer exotic correlated quantum matter. The vast number of sites required to model moir\'e systems in real space remains a formidable challenge due to the immense computational resources required. Super-moir\'e materials push this requirement to the limit, where millions or even billions of sites need to be considered, a requirement beyond the capabilities of conventional methods for interacting systems. Here, we establish a methodology that allows solving correlated states in systems reaching a billion sites, that exploits tensor-network representations of real-space Hamiltonians and self-consistent real-space mean-field equations. Our method combines a tensor-network kernel polynomial method with quantics tensor cross interpolation algorithm, enabling us to solve exponentially large models, including those whose single particle Hamiltonian is too large to be stored explicitly. We demonstrate our methodology with super-moir\'e systems featuring spatially modulated hoppings, many-body interactions and domain walls, showing that it allows access to self-consistent symmetry broken states and spectral functions of real-space models reaching a billion sites. Our methodology provides a strategy to solve exceptionally large interacting problems, providing a widely applicable strategy to compute correlated super-moir\'e quantum matter.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04373'&gt;arXiv:2503.04373&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 06 Mar 2025 12:17:11 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

In Part I, foundational topics are covered, including tensor structures and network representations like Matrix Product States (MPS) and Tree Tensor Networks (TTN). These preliminaries provide readers with the core mathematical tools and concepts necessary for quantum physics and quantum computing applications, bridging the gap between multi-linear algebra and complex quantum systems. Part II explores practical applications of tensor networks in simulating quantum dynamics, with a particular focus on the efficiency they offer for systems of high computational complexity. Key topics include Hamiltonian dynamics, quantum annealing, open system dynamics, and optimization strategies using TN frameworks. A final chapter addresses the emerging role of "quantum magic" in tensor networks. It delves into non-stabilizer states and their contribution to quantum computational power beyond classical simulability, featuring methods such as stabilizer-enhanced MPS and the Clifford-dressed TDVP.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04423'&gt;arXiv:2503.04423&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 06 Mar 2025 13:31:17 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Detection of 2D SPT Order with Partial Symmetries</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04510</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Alex Turzillo, Naren Manjunath, Jose Garre-Rubio&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; A method of using partial symmetries to distinguish two dimensional symmetry protected topological (SPT) phases of on-site, unitary symmetries is proposed. This novel order parameter takes a wavefunction, such as a ground state of a lattice model, and detects its SPT invariants as expectation values of finitely supported operators, without the need for flux insertion. The construction exploits the rotational symmetry of the lattice to extract on-site SPT invariants, building upon prior work on probing crystalline SPT phases with partial rotations. The method is demonstrated by computing the order parameter analytically on group cohomology models and numerically on a family of states interpolating between the CZX state and a trivial state. Its robustness is suggested by interpreting partial symmetries as generating the topological partition functions of lens spaces.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04510'&gt;arXiv:2503.04510&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 06 Mar 2025 14:56:52 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Entanglement Transitions in Noisy Quantum Circuits on Trees</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05027</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Vikram Ravindranath, Yiqiu Han, Xiao Chen&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Decoherence is ubiquitous, and poses a significant impediment to the observation of quantum phenomena, such as the measurement-induced entanglement phase transition (MIPT). In this work, we study entanglement transitions in quantum circuits on trees, subject to both noise and measurements. We uncover a rich phase diagram that describes the ability of a tree quantum circuit to retain quantum or classical information in the presence of decoherence. By developing a mapping between the dynamics of information on the tree to a classical Markov process -- also defined on the tree -- we obtain exact solutions to the entanglement transitions displayed by the circuit under various noise and measurement strengths. Moreover, we find a host of phenomena, including the MIPT, which are \textit{robust} to decoherence. The analytical tractability facilitated by the method developed in this paper showcases the first example of an exactly solvable noise-robust MIPT, and holds promise for studies on broader, tree-like circuits.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05027'&gt;arXiv:2503.05027&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 06 Mar 2025 22:51:14 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Preparing Code States via Seed-Entangler-Enriched Sequential Quantum Circuits: Application to Tetra-Digit Topological Error-Correcting Codes</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05374</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Yu-Tao Hu, Meng-Yuan Li, Peng Ye&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We introduce a unified and efficient quantum circuit framework, termed the \emph{Seed-Entangler-Enriched Sequential Quantum Circuit} (SEESQC) to prepare quantum states in code space of topological error-correcting codes. Specifically, we apply SEESQC to prepare code states of Tetra-Digit models -- a broad class of long-range entangled stabilizer codes indexed by a four-digit parameter. These models are not rare but encompass Toric Codes across arbitrary dimensions and subsume the X-cube fracton code as special cases. Featuring a hierarchical structure of generalized entanglement renormalization group, many Tetra-Digit models host spatially extended excitations (e.g., loops, membranes, and exotic non-manifold objects) with constrained mobility and deformability, and exhibit system-size-dependent ground state degeneracies that scale exponentially with a polynomial in linear sizes. In this work, we first graphically and algebraically demonstrate quantum circuits for computational basis states, before generalizing to broader cases. Central to this framework is a key ingredient termed the \emph{seed-entangler} acting on a small number of qubits termed \textit{seeds}, enabling a systematic scheme to achieve arbitrary code states. Remarkably, the number of available seeds equals the number of logical qubits for the constructed examples, which leaves plenty of room for future investigation in theoretical physics, mathematics and quantum information science. With experimental feasibility via synthetic dimensions in modern quantum simulators, this framework transcends spatial dimensions, bridges liquid and non-liquid states, unifies gapped phases governed by distinct entanglement renormalization group schemes, and offers a pathway toward engineering topological phases and manipulating logical qubits.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05374'&gt;arXiv:2503.05374&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 07 Mar 2025 12:32:13 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Harnessing Quantum Dynamics for Robust and Scalable Quantum Extreme Learning Machines</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05535</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Payal D. Solanki, Anh Pham&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Quantum Extreme Learning Machine (QELM) is an emerging hybrid quantum machine learning framework that leverages quantum system dynamics to enhance classical models. However, QELM can suffer from the exponential concentration problem, where excessive entanglement reduces model expressivity. In this work, we gain insight into this challenge and demonstrate how tensor network methods specifically, the Time Dependent Variational Principle (TDVP) with Matrix Product States (MPS) can efficiently simulate quantum systems while controlling entanglement and mitigating exponential concentration. Using numerical experiments on the Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology (MNIST) dataset, we show that time-evolving an MPS system modeled as a chain of Rydberg atoms produces high-quality data embeddings with low classical computational overhead. Our findings indicate that exact simulation of quantum dynamics is not necessary for strong machine learning performance; even approximate quantum embeddings can yield competitive results. Furthermore, we observe that both increased disorder in the quantum state achieved by tuning Hamiltonian parameters and careful control of entanglement directly correlate with improved model accuracy, highlighting the importance of these factors in optimizing QELM performance.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05535'&gt;arXiv:2503.05535&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 07 Mar 2025 16:03:24 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Less Quantum, More Advantage: An End-to-End Quantum Algorithm for the Jones Polynomial</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Tuomas Laakkonen, Enrico Rinaldi, Chris N. Self, Eli Chertkov, Matthew DeCross, David Hayes, Brian Neyenhuis, Marcello Benedetti, Konstantinos Meichanetzidis&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We present an end-to-end reconfigurable algorithmic pipeline for solving a famous problem in knot theory using a noisy digital quantum computer, namely computing the value of the Jones polynomial at the fifth root of unity within additive error for any input link, i.e. a closed braid. This problem is DQC1-complete for Markov-closed braids and BQP-complete for Plat-closed braids, and we accommodate both versions of the problem. Even though it is widely believed that DQC1 is strictly contained in BQP, and so is 'less quantum', the resource requirements of classical algorithms for the DQC1 version are at least as high as for the BQP version, and so we potentially gain 'more advantage' by focusing on Markov-closed braids in our exposition. We demonstrate our quantum algorithm on Quantinuum's H2-2 quantum computer and show the effect of problem-tailored error-mitigation techniques. Further, leveraging that the Jones polynomial is a link invariant, we construct an efficiently verifiable benchmark to characterise the effect of noise present in a given quantum processor. In parallel, we implement and benchmark the state-of-the-art tensor-network-based classical algorithms for computing the Jones polynomial. The practical tools provided in this work allow for precise resource estimation to identify near-term quantum advantage for a meaningful quantum-native problem in knot theory.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05625'&gt;arXiv:2503.05625&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 07 Mar 2025 17:50:48 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Dynamics of disordered quantum systems with two- and three-dimensional tensor networks</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Joseph Tindall, Antonio Mello, Matt Fishman, Miles Stoudenmire, Dries Sels&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Quantum spin glasses form a good testbed for studying the performance of various quantum annealing and optimization algorithms. In this work we show how two- and three-dimensional tensor networks can accurately and efficiently simulate the quantum annealing dynamics of Ising spin glasses on a range of lattices. Such dynamics were recently simulated using D-Wave's Advantage$2$ system [A. D. King et al, Science, 10.1126/science.ado6285 (2025)] and, following extensive comparisons to existing numerical methods, claimed to be beyond the reach of classical computation. Here we show that by evolving lattice-specific tensor networks with simple belief propagation to keep up with the entanglement generated during the time evolution and then extracting expectation values with more sophisticated variants of belief propagation, state-of-the-art accuracies can be reached with modest computational resources. We exploit the scalability of our simulations and simulate a system of over $300$ qubits, allowing us to verify the universal physics present and extract a value for the associated Kibble-Zurek exponent which agrees with recent values obtained in literature. Our results demonstrate that tensor networks are a viable approach for simulating large scale quantum dynamics in two and three dimensions on classical computers, and algorithmic advancements are expected to expand their applicability going forward.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05693'&gt;arXiv:2503.05693&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 07 Mar 2025 18:58:03 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Quantum State Designs from Minimally Random Quantum Circuits</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05698</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Jonathon Riddell, Katja Klobas, Bruno Bertini&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Random many-body states are both a useful tool to model certain physical systems and an important asset for quantum computation. Realising them, however, generally requires an exponential (in system size) amount of resources. Recent research has presented a way out by showing that one can generate random states, or more precisely a controlled approximation of them, by applying a quantum circuit built in terms of few-body unitary gates. Most of this research, however, has been focussed on the case of quantum circuits composed by completely random unitary gates. Here we consider what happens for circuits that, instead, involve a minimal degree of randomness. Specifically, we concentrate on two different settings: (a) brickwork quantum circuits with a single one-qudit random matrix at a boundary; (b) brickwork quantum circuits with fixed interactions but random one-qudit gates everywhere. We show that, for any given initial state, (a) and (b) produce a distribution of states approaching the Haar distribution in the limit of large circuit depth. More precisely, we show that the moments of the distribution produced by our circuits can approximate the ones of the Haar distribution in a depth proportional to the system size. Interestingly we find that in both Cases (a) and (b) the relaxation to the Haar distribution occurs in two steps - this is in contrast with what happens in fully random circuits. Moreover, we show that choosing appropriately the fixed interactions, for example taking the local gate to be a dual-unitary gate with high enough entangling power, minimally random circuits produce a Haar random distribution more rapidly than fully random circuits. In particular, dual-unitary circuits with maximal entangling power - i.e. perfect tensors - appear to provide the optimal quantum state design preparation for any design number.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05698'&gt;arXiv:2503.05698&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 07 Mar 2025 18:59:10 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Tensor Learning and Compression of N-phonon Interactions</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05913</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Yao Luo, Dhruv Mangtani, Shiyu Peng, Jia Yao, Sergei Kliavinek, Marco Bernardi&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Phonon interactions from lattice anharmonicity govern thermal properties and heat transport in materials. These interactions are described by n-th order interatomic force constants (n-IFCs), which can be viewed as high-dimensional tensors correlating the motion of n atoms, or equivalently encoding n-phonon scattering processes in momentum space. Here, we introduce a tensor decomposition to efficiently compress n-IFCs for arbitrary order n. Using tensor learning, we find optimal low-rank approximations of n-IFCs by solving the resulting optimization problem. Our approach reveals the inherent low dimensionality of phonon-phonon interactions and allows compression of the 3 and 4-IFC tensors by factors of up to $10^3-10^4$ while retaining high accuracy in calculations of phonon scattering rates and thermal conductivity. Calculations of thermal conductivity using the compressed n-IFCs achieve a speed-up by nearly three orders of magnitude with &gt;98% accuracy relative to the reference uncompressed solution. These calculations include both 3- and 4-phonon scattering and are shown for a diverse range of materials (Si, HgTe, MgO, TiNiSn and monoclinic ZrO$_2$). In addition to accelerating state-of-the-art thermal transport calculations, the method shown here paves the way for modeling strongly anharmonic materials and higher-order phonon interactions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05913'&gt;arXiv:2503.05913&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 07 Mar 2025 20:21:44 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Matrix Product States in the Heisenberg Picture: Projectivity, Ergodicity, and Mixing</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06546</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Abdessatar Souissi, Amenallah Andolsi&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; This paper introduces a Heisenberg picture approach to Matrix Product States (MPS), offering a rigorous yet intuitive framework to explore their structure and classification. MPS efficiently represent ground states of quantum many-body systems, with infinite MPS (iMPS) capturing long-range correlations and thermodynamic behavior. We classify MPS into projective and non-projective types, distinguishing those with finite correlation structures from those requiring ergodic quantum channels to define a meaningful limit. Using the Markov-Dobrushin inequality, we establish conditions for infinite-volume states and introduce ergodic and mixing MPS. As an application, we analyze the depolarizing MPS, highlighting its lack of finite correlations and the need for an alternative ergodic description. This work deepens the mathematical foundations of MPS and iMPS, providing new insights into entanglement, phase transitions, and quantum dynamics.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06546'&gt;arXiv:2503.06546&lt;/a&gt;] Published Sun, 09 Mar 2025 10:36:04 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Quantum phase diagram of the spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ Heisenberg antiferromagnet on the square-kagome lattice: a tensor network study</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07689</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Saeed S. Jahromi, Yasir Iqbal&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We assess the quantum phase diagram of the spin-$1/2$ Heisenberg antiferromagnetic model on the square-kagome lattice upon varying the two symmetry inequivalent nearest-neighbor couplings, $J_{1}$ on squares and $J$ on triangles. Employing large-scale tensor network simulations based on infinite projected entangled pair states, we find four distinct valence bond crystal (VBC) states and a ferrimagnetically ordered region. Starting from the limit of weakly interacting squares for small $J/J_{1}$ where a plaquette cross-dimer VBC with long-range singlets is stabilized, we show that with increasing $J/J_{1}$ it transitions to a VBC with resonances over hexagons, the so-called loop-six VBC, which persists across the isotropic point. Interestingly, a generalized version of the pinwheel VBC, earlier reported to be a closely competing state for the isotropic model is energetically stabilized in a sliver of parameter space right beyond the isotropic point. For further increases in $J/J_{1}$, a decorated loop-six VBC occupies an appreciable region of parameter space before transitioning into an imperfect ferrimagnet which finally evolves into a Lieb ferrimagnet. Our characterization of the underlying phases and phase transitions is based on a careful analysis of the energy, magnetization, spin-spin correlations, and bond entanglement entropy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07689'&gt;arXiv:2503.07689&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 10 Mar 2025 16:15:45 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Robustness of Vacancy-Bound Non-Abelian Anyons in the Kitaev Model in a Magnetic Field</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07716</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Bo Xiao, Gonzalo Alvarez, Gábor Halász&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The search for non-Abelian anyons in quantum spin liquids (QSLs) is crucial for advancing fault-tolerant topological quantum computation. In the exactly solvable Kitaev honeycomb model, nonmagnetic spin vacancies are known to bind emergent gauge fluxes of the QSL ground state, which in turn become non-Abelian anyons for an infinitesimal magnetic field. Here, we investigate how this approach for stabilizing non-Abelian anyons at spin vacancies extends to a finite magnetic field represented by a proper Zeeman term. Specifically, we use large-scale density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations to compute the vacancy-anyon binding energy as a function of magnetic field for both the ferromagnetic (FM) and antiferromagnetic (AFM) Kitaev models. We find that, while the inclusion of the field weakens anyon binding in both cases, there is a pronounced difference in the finite-field behavior; the binding energy remains finite within the entire QSL phase for the FM Kitaev model but approaches zero already inside this phase for the AFM Kitaev model. To reliably compute a very small binding energy that is three orders of magnitude below the magnetic interaction strength, we also introduce a refined definition for the binding energy and an extrapolation scheme for its accurate extraction through exclusively ground-state properties using DMRG.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07716'&gt;arXiv:2503.07716&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 10 Mar 2025 18:00:01 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Counting with the quantum alternating operator ansatz</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07720</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Julien Drapeau, Shreya Banerjee, Stefanos Kourtis&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We introduce a variational algorithm based on the quantum alternating operator ansatz (QAOA) for the approximate solution of computationally hard counting problems. Our algorithm, dubbed VQCount, is based on the equivalence between random sampling and approximate counting and employs QAOA as a solution sampler. We first prove that VQCount improves upon previous work by reducing exponentially the number of samples needed to obtain an approximation within a multiplicative factor of the exact count. Using tensor network simulations, we then study the typical performance of VQCount with shallow circuits on synthetic instances of two #P-hard problems, positive #NAE3SAT and positive #1-in-3SAT. We employ the original quantum approximate optimization algorithm version of QAOA, as well as the Grover-mixer variant which guarantees a uniform solution probability distribution. We observe a tradeoff between QAOA success probability and sampling uniformity, which we exploit to achieve an exponential gain in efficiency over naive rejection sampling. Our results highlight the potential and limitations of variational algorithms for approximate counting.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07720'&gt;arXiv:2503.07720&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 10 Mar 2025 18:00:02 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Altermagnetism and beyond in the $t$-$t^\prime$-$δ$ Fermi-Hubbard model</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08362</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Saisai He, Jize Zhao, Hong-Gang Luo, Shijie Hu&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; In this work, we revisit the phase diagram of the $t$-$t^\prime$-$\delta$ Fermi-Hubbard model on the square lattice to gain a more comprehensive understanding of this correlated model at half filling. This model has recently become a prominent topic of research because it hosts altermagnetic phases. Using mean-field analysis, we identify four metallic phases and two insulating phases with nontrivial magnetic orders at an intermediate value of $\delta = 0.5$, presenting a rich ground-state phase diagram in the $U$-$t^\prime$ plane. We also highlight the distinct features of the Fermi surface topology for each metallic phase. To go beyond the mean-field theory, we employ the density-matrix renormalization group method to simulate the ground state numerically. The phase boundaries are determined from the discontinuities and peaks in the entanglement entropy and magnetizations. In addition to the phases identified in the mean-field theory, we find a valence-bond solid state in a narrow intermediate-$t'$ region. Our work offers a firm step forward in understanding the complex behaviors of correlated electrons in the $t$-$t^\prime$-$\delta$ Hubbard model over a large parameter space.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08362'&gt;arXiv:2503.08362&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 11 Mar 2025 12:20:15 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Fully numerical Hartree-Fock calculations for atoms and small molecules with quantics tensor trains</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08430</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Paul Haubenwallner, Matthias Heller&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We present a fully numerical framework for the optimization of molecule-specific quantum chemical basis functions within the quantics tensor train format using a finite-difference scheme. The optimization is driven by solving the Hartree-Fock equations (HF) with the density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) algorithm on Cartesian grids that are iteratively refined. In contrast to the standard way of tackling the mean-field problem by expressing the molecular orbitals as linear combinations of atomic orbitals (LCAO) our method only requires as much basis functions as there are electrons within the system. Benchmark calculations for atoms and molecules with up to ten electrons show excellent agreement with LCAO calculations with large basis sets supporting the validity of the tensor network approach. Our work therefore offers a promising alternative to well-established HF-solvers and could pave the way to define highly accurate, fully numerical, molecule-adaptive basis sets, which, in the future, could lead to benefits for post-HF calculations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08430'&gt;arXiv:2503.08430&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 11 Mar 2025 13:44:23 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>A hybrid method integrating Green's function Monte Carlo and projected entangled pair states</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; He-Yu Lin, Rong-Qiang He, Yibin Guo, Zhong-Yi Lu&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; This paper introduces a hybrid approach combining Green's function Monte Carlo (GFMC) method with projected entangled pair state (PEPS) ansatz. This hybrid method regards PEPS as a trial state and a guiding wave function in GFMC. By leveraging PEPS's proficiency in capturing quantum state entanglement and GFMC's efficient parallel architecture, the hybrid method is well-suited for the accurate and efficient treatment of frustrated quantum spin systems. As a benchmark, we applied this approach to study the frustrated $J_1$-$J_2$ Heisenberg model on a square lattice with periodic boundary conditions (PBC). Compared with other numerical methods, our approach integrating PEPS and GFMC shows competitive accuracy in the performance of ground-state energy. This paper provides systematic and comprehensive discussion of the approach of our previous work.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08450'&gt;arXiv:2503.08450&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 11 Mar 2025 13:59:36 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Robust Simulations of Many-Body Symmetry-Protected Topological Phase Transitions on a Quantum Processor</title>

Recent advancements have unveiled symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases in many-body systems as a unique class of short-range entangled states, notable for their nontrivial edge modes and characteristic ground-state entanglement gap. In this study, we demonstrate the robust simulation of many-body ground states of an Ising-cluster model on a quantum computer. By employing the method of quantum imaginary-time evolution (QITE) combined with enhanced zero-noise extrapolation techniques, we achieve accurate measurements of the transition between trivial and cluster SPT phases. Furthermore, we measured the characteristic edge modes and their associated topological entanglement properties, such as the second R\'enyi entropy, reduced density matrix, and entanglement spectral gap. Our work demonstrates the potential of using QITE in investigating sophisticated quantum phase transitions and critical phenomena on quantum computers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08776'&gt;arXiv:2503.08776&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 11 Mar 2025 18:00:02 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Combining Local Symmetry Exploitation and Reinforcement Learning for Optimised Probabilistic Inference -- A Work In Progress</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08786</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Sagad Hamid, Tanya Braun&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Efficient probabilistic inference by variable elimination in graphical models requires an optimal elimination order. However, finding an optimal order is a challenging combinatorial optimisation problem for models with a large number of random variables. Most recently, a reinforcement learning approach has been proposed to find efficient contraction orders in tensor networks. Due to the duality between graphical models and tensor networks, we adapt this approach to probabilistic inference in graphical models. Furthermore, we incorporate structure exploitation into the process of finding an optimal order. Currently, the agent's cost function is formulated in terms of intermediate result sizes which are exponential in the number of indices (i.e., random variables). We show that leveraging specific structures during inference allows for introducing compact encodings of intermediate results which can be significantly smaller. By considering the compact encoding sizes for the cost function instead, we enable the agent to explore more efficient contraction orders. The structure we consider in this work is the presence of local symmetries (i.e., symmetries within a model's factors).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08786'&gt;arXiv:2503.08786&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 11 Mar 2025 18:00:23 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Circuits as a simple platform for the emergence of hydrodynamics in deterministic chaotic many-body systems</title>

Garrahan, Benjamin Doyon&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The emergence of hydrodynamics is one of the deepest phenomena in many-body systems. Arguably, the hydrodynamic equations are also the most important tools for predicting large-scale behaviour. Understanding how such equations emerge from microscopic deterministic dynamics is a century-old problem, despite recent progress in fine-tuned integrable systems. Due to the universality of hydrodynamics, the specific microscopic implementation should not matter. Here, we show that classical deterministic circuits provide a minimal, exact, and efficient platform that admits non-trivial hydrodynamic behaviour for deterministic but chaotic systems. By developing new techniques and focusing on 1D circuits as a proof of concept, we obtain the characteristic dynamics, including relaxation to Gibbs states, exact Euler equations, shocks, diffusion, and exact KPZ super-diffusion. Our methods can be easily generalised to higher dimensions or quantum circuits.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08788'&gt;arXiv:2503.08788&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 11 Mar 2025 18:00:44 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

In this description quantum states and operators are encoded by the topology of spaces that are used as modules to build the quantum mechanical model, while expectation values and probabilities are given by topological invariants of spaces, knots and links. The notes focus on the specific way the topology encodes quantum mechanical features, or, equivalently, on how these features can be controlled through the topology. A topological classification of entanglement is discussed, as well as properties of entanglement entropy and basic quantum protocols. The primary aim is to build a less conventional diagrammatic intuition about quantum mechanics, expanding the paradigm of ``Quantum Picturalism".&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08846'&gt;arXiv:2503.08846&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 11 Mar 2025 19:35:24 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

We show one route to obtaining excitations and dynamical spectral functions by using the techniques of DMET to approximate the matrix elements that arise in a single-mode inspired excitation ansatz. We demonstrate this approach in the 1D Hubbard model, comparing the neutral excitations, single-particle density of states, charge, and spin dynamical structure factors to benchmarks from the Bethe ansatz and density matrix renormalization group.

      <title>Two-party entanglement distribution in XXZ spin chains with the exponential and power-law long-range interactions</title>

Wang, Yan-Kui Bai&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Entanglement distribution is a fundamental property in quantum many-body physics, but the effect of long-range interactions on the distribution has not been fully understood. Here, we study long-range two-party entanglement (TPE) and explore its distribution properties in XXZ spin chains with the exponential and power-law long-range interactions(ELRIs and PLRIs). In the thermodynamic limit case with the ELRIs, the TPE quantified by two-qubit concurrence decays exponentially along with two-site distance and the long-range concurrences can indicate the paramagnetic-ferromagnetic phase transition. We present a fine-grained entanglement distribution relations among the entanglement truncation length, total concurrences and two-tangles in the infinite spin chains. Moreover, in the finite XXZ chain with the more common PLRIs, the TPE decays algebraically along with the two-spin distance, and the total concurrence can exhibit a piecewise function with respect to total two-tangles.

      <title>Variational preparation of normal matrix product states on quantum computers</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Ben Jaderberg, George Pennington, Kate V. Marshall, Lewis W. Anderson, Abhishek Agarwal, Lachlan P. Lindoy, Ivan Rungger, Stefano Mensa, Jason Crain&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Preparing matrix product states (MPSs) on quantum computers is an essential routine in the simulation of many-body physics. However, widely-used schemes based on staircase circuits are often too deep to execute on current hardware. Here we demonstrate that MPSs with short-range correlations can be prepared with shallow circuits by leveraging heuristics from approximate quantum compiling (AQC). We achieve this with ADAPT-AQC, an adaptive-ansatz preparation algorithm, and introduce a generalised initialisation procedure for the existing AQC-Tensor algorithm. We first compare these methods for the task of preparing a molecular electronic structure ground state. We then use them to prepare an antiferromagnetic (AFM) ground state of the 50-site Heisenberg XXZ spin chain near the AFM-XY phase boundary. Through the execution of circuits with up to 59 CZ depth and 1251 CZ gates, we perform a global quench and observe the relaxation of magnetic ordering in a parameter regime previously inaccessible due to deep ground state preparation circuits. Our results demonstrate how the integration of quantum and classical resources can push the boundary of what can be studied on quantum computers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09683'&gt;arXiv:2503.09683&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 12 Mar 2025 18:00:00 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Fluctuation corrections to the free energy of strongly correlated electron systems</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09696</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; David Riegler, Jannis Seufert, Ronny Thomale, Peter Wölfle&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We determine the free energy of strongly correlated electron systems in the example of the Hubbard model by calculating the contribution of spin and charge fluctuations to the Gutzwiller approximation mean field result. We employ the slave boson formulation of Kotliar and Ruckenstein in its spin-rotation invariant form in the usual continuous time approximation of the functional integral representation, corrected by "high frequency contributions" (SRIKR+). Previous method-related shortcomings are shown to be overcome when the correct operator ordering for the renormalized kinetic energy is used. The results for the ground state energy in the paramagnetic phase are in very good agreement with state-of-the-art results obtained by methods such as density matrix embedded theory (DMET), quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) and others. The leading low temperature behavior of the free energy allows to extract the quasiparticle effective mass, in particular its enhancement near a continuous phase transition into an ordered state. Our work demonstrates that the SRIKR+ method is competitive with the best available alternative methods and equips the slave-boson approach with an improved synoptic power to explore strongly correlated electron systems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09696'&gt;arXiv:2503.09696&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 12 Mar 2025 18:00:01 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>New perspectives on Density-Matrix Embedding Theory</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09881</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Alicia Negre, Fabian Faulstich, Raehyun Kim, Thomas Ayral, Lin Lin, Eric Cancès&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Quantum embedding methods enable the study of large, strongly correlated quantum systems by (usually self-consistent) decomposition into computationally manageable subproblems, in the spirit of divide-and-conquer methods. Among these, Density Matrix Embedding Theory (DMET) is an efficient approach that enforces self-consistency at the level of one-particle reduced density matrices (1-RDMs), facilitating applications across diverse quantum systems. However, conventional DMET is constrained by the requirement that the global 1-RDM (low-level descriptor) be an orthogonal projector, limiting flexibility in bath construction and potentially impeding accuracy in strongly correlated regimes. In this work, we introduce a generalized DMET framework in which the low-level descriptor can be an arbitrary 1-RDM and the bath construction is based on optimizing a quantitative criterion related to the maximal disentanglement between different fragments. This yields an alternative yet controllable bath space construction for generic 1-RDMs, lifting a key limitation of conventional DMET. We demonstrate its consistency with conventional DMET in appropriate limits and exploring its implications for bath construction, downfolding (impurity Hamiltonian construction), low-level solvers, and adaptive fragmentation. We expect that this more flexible framework, which leads to several new variants of DMET, can improve the robustness and accuracy of DMET.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09881'&gt;arXiv:2503.09881&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 12 Mar 2025 22:35:37 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Mixed-state learnability transitions in monitored noisy quantum dynamics</title>

Potter, Sarang Gopalakrishnan&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We consider learnability transitions in monitored quantum systems that undergo noisy evolution, subject to a global strong symmetry -- i.e., in addition to the measuring apparatus, the system can interact with an unobserved environment, but does not exchange charge with it. As in the pure-state setting, we find two information-theoretic phases -- a sharp (fuzzy) phase in which an eavesdropper can rapidly (slowly) learn the symmetry charge. However, because the dynamics is noisy, both phases can be simulated efficiently using tensor networks. Indeed, even when the true dynamics is unitary, introducing noise by hand allows an eavesdropper to efficiently learn the symmetry charge from local measurements, as we demonstrate. We identify the fuzzy phase in this setting as a mixed-state phase that exhibits spontaneous strong-to-weak symmetry breaking.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10308'&gt;arXiv:2503.10308&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 13 Mar 2025 12:37:11 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking and average symmetry protected topological order in the doubled Hilbert space</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10311</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Yoshihito Kuno, Takahiro Orito, Ikuo Ichinose&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Discovering and categorizing quantum orders in mixed many-body systems are currently one of the most important problems. Target model in this study is an extended version of the cluster model in one dimension with $Z_2\otimes Z_2$ symmetry, and we investigate effects of decoherence applied to the ground state of the model, focusing on the symmetry aspect. By using a scheme that we propose, a strong symmetry protected topological (SPT) mixed state and double average SPT (ASPT) state are constructed through the pure gapless SPT order and the domain-wall duality. Among them, the double ASPT is categorized by coexisting orders, i.e., a strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking and ASPT defined by the remaining weak and strong symmetries. We make use of the doubled Hilbert space formalism for the construction scheme. We numerically demonstrate the emergence of the two mixed SPT states and find that a phase transition occurs between them tuned by the strength of decoherence. Finally, we discuss the coexistence of SPT and SWSSB in the double SPT state from the view point of symmetrically invertible property, and comment on the classification of ASPT proposed recently. Suitable multiple-decoherence channel applied to SPT states gives a broad possibility to induce rich ASPTs, possessing non-trivial internal entanglement properties from the view of doubled Hilbert space formalism.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10311'&gt;arXiv:2503.10311&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 13 Mar 2025 12:44:24 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Approximation Methods for Simulation and Equivalence Checking of Noisy Quantum Circuits</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10340</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Mingyu Huang, Ji Guan, Wang Fang, Mingsheng Ying&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; In the current NISQ (Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum) era, simulating and verifying noisy quantum circuits is crucial but faces challenges such as quantum state explosion and complex noise representations, constraining simulation, and equivalence checking to circuits with a limited number of qubits. This paper introduces an approximation algorithm for simulating and assessing the equivalence of noisy quantum circuits, specifically designed to improve scalability under low-noise conditions. The approach utilizes a novel tensor network diagram combined with singular value decomposition to approximate the tensors of quantum noises. The implementation is based on Google's TensorNetwork Python package for contraction. Experimental results on realistic quantum circuits with realistic hardware noise models indicate that our algorithm can simulate and check the equivalence of QAOA (Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm) circuits with around 200 qubits, surpassing the state-of-the-art methods by noise number and execution time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10340'&gt;arXiv:2503.10340&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 13 Mar 2025 13:19:30 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Towards Using Matrix-Free Tensor Decompositions to Systematically Improve Approximate Tensor-Networks</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10380</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Karl Pierce&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We investigate a novel approach to approximate tensor-network contraction via the exact, matrix-free decomposition of full tensor-networks. We study this method as a means to eliminate the propagation of error in the approximation of tensor-networks. Importantly, this decomposition-based approach is generic, i.e. it does not depend on a specific tensor-network, the tensor index (physical) ordering, or the choice of tensor decomposition. Careful consideration should be made to determine the best decomposition strategy. Furthermore, this method does not rely on robust cancellation of errors (i.e. the Taylor expansion). As a means to study the effectiveness of the approach, we replace the exact contraction of the particle particle ladder (PPL) tensor diagram in the popular coupled-cluster with single and double excitation (CCSD) method with a low-rank tensor decomposition, namely the canonical polyadic decomposition (CPD). With this approach, we replace an $\mathcal{O}(N^6)$ tensor contractions with a potentially reduced-scaling $\mathcal{O}(N^4R)$ optimization problem, where $R$ is the CP rank, and we reduce the computational storage of the PPL tensor from $\mathcal{O}(N^4)$ to $\mathcal{O}(NR)$, although we do not take advantage of this compression in this study. To minimize the cost of the CPD optimization, we utilize the iterative structure of CCSD to efficiently initialize the CPD optimization. We show that accurate chemically-relevant energy values can be computed with an error of less than 1 kcal/mol using a relatively low CP rank.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10380'&gt;arXiv:2503.10380&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 13 Mar 2025 13:56:54 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Grokking as an entanglement transition in tensor network machine learning</title>

By working in the quantum-inspired machine learning framework based on tensor networks, we numerically prove that grokking phenomenon can be related to an entanglement dynamical transition in the underlying quantum many-body systems, consisting in a one-dimensional lattice with each site hosting a qubit. Two datasets are considered as use case scenarios, namely fashion MNIST and gene expression communities of hepatocellular carcinoma. In both cases, we train Matrix Product State (MPS) to perform binary classification tasks, and we analyse the learning dynamics. We exploit measurement of qubits magnetization and correlation functions in the MPS network as a tool to identify meaningful and relevant gene subcommunities, verified by means of enrichment procedures.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10483'&gt;arXiv:2503.10483&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 13 Mar 2025 15:51:23 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

Applications range from quantum computation to condensed matter physics and quantum gravity. We seek to bridge the approaches of these fields, which define and study complexity using different frameworks and tools. We describe several definitions of complexity, along with their key properties. In quantum information theory, we focus on complexity growth in random quantum circuits. In quantum many-body systems and quantum field theory (QFT), we discuss a geometric definition of complexity in terms of geodesics on the unitary group. In dynamical systems, we explore a definition of complexity in terms of state or operator spreading, as well as concepts from tensor-networks. We also outline applications to simple quantum systems, quantum many-body models, and QFTs including conformal field theories (CFTs). Finally, we explain the proposed relationship between complexity and gravitational observables within the holographic anti-de Sitter (AdS)/CFT correspondence.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10753'&gt;arXiv:2503.10753&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 13 Mar 2025 18:00:01 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

The best-known example is the Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki (AKLT) model, which is the ground state of a 2-body nearest-neighbor parent Hamiltonian. We show that such simple parent Hamiltonians for MPS models are, in fact, much more prevalent than hitherto known: The existence of a single example with a simple Hamiltonian for a given choice of dimensions already implies that any generic MPS with those dimensions possesses an equally simple Hamiltonian. We illustrate our finding by discussing a number of models with nearest-neighbor parent Hamiltonians, which generalize the AKLT model on various levels.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10767'&gt;arXiv:2503.10767&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 13 Mar 2025 18:00:18 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Wavefunction optimization at the complete basis set limit with Multiwavelets and DMRG</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Martina Nibbi, Luca Frediani, Evgueni Dinvay, Christian B. Mendl&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) is a powerful numerical technique to solve strongly correlated quantum systems: it deals well with systems which are not dominated by a single configuration (unlike Coupled Cluster) and it converges rapidly to the Full Configuration Interaction (FCI) limit (unlike truncated Configuration Interaction (CI) expansions). In this work, we develop an algorithm integrating DMRG within the multiwavelet-based multiresolution analysis (MRA). Unlike fixed basis sets, multiwavelets offer an adaptive and hierarchical representation of functions, approaching the complete basis set limit to a specified precision. As a result, this combined technique leverages the multireference capability of DMRG and the complete basis set limit of MRA and multiwavelets. More specifically, we adopt a pre-existing Lagrangian optimization algorithm for orbitals represented in the MRA domain and improve its computational efficiency by replacing the original CI calculations with DMRG. Additionally, we substitute the reduced density matrices computation with the direct extraction of energy gradients from the DMRG tensors. We apply our method to small systems such H2, He, HeH2, BeH2 and N2. The results demonstrate that our approach reduces the final energy while keeping the number of orbitals low compared to FCI calculations on an atomic orbital basis set.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10808'&gt;arXiv:2503.10808&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 13 Mar 2025 18:59:03 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

We show that the Gaussian and Ising transitions that separate the topological Haldane phase from the two anisotropic phases eventually fuse into a higher symmetry point characterized by the Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) SU(2)$_2$ critical theory providing a lattice realization of the conformal embedding. On the other side of the WZW multi-critical point, the Ising critical line reappears together with the eight-vertex transition. This transition is a one-dimensional realization of a deconfined quantum criticality separating the dimerized and Ising antiferromagnetic phases - two ordered phases with incompatible order parameters.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11413'&gt;arXiv:2503.11413&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 14 Mar 2025 13:54:14 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of the Hubbard Model on the Bethe Lattice</title>

Our findings reveal two distinct thermodynamic phases: a low-temperature antiferromagnetic phase, where spin SU(2) symmetry is broken, and a high-temperature paramagnetic phase. A key feature of the system is the separation of energy scales for charge and spin excitations, which is reflected in the temperature dependence of thermodynamic quantities and the disparity between spin and charge gaps extracted from their respective susceptibilities. At the critical point, both spin and charge susceptibilities exhibit singularities, suggesting that charge excitations are not fully decoupled from their spin counterparts. Additionally, the double occupancy number exhibits a non-monotonic temperature dependence, indicative of an entropy-driven Pomeranchuk effect. These results demonstrate that the loopless Bethe lattice effectively captures the essential physics of the Hubbard model while providing a computationally efficient framework for studying strongly correlated electronic systems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11598'&gt;arXiv:2503.11598&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 14 Mar 2025 17:11:37 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Circuit Design based on Feature Similarity for Quantum Generative Modeling</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11983</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Mathis Makarski, Jumpei Kato, Yuki Sato, Naoki Yamamoto&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Quantum generative models may achieve an advantage on quantum devices by their inherent probabilistic nature and efficient sampling strategies. However, current approaches mostly rely on general-purpose circuits, such as the hardware efficient ansatz paired with a random initialization strategy, which are known to suffer from trainability issues such as barren plateaus. To address these issues, a tensor network pretraining framework that initializes a quantum circuit ansatz with a classically computed high-quality solution for a linear entanglement structure has been proposed in literature. In order to improve the classical solution, the quantum circuit needs to be extended, while it is still an open question how the extension affects trainability. In this work, we propose the metric-based extension heuristic to design an extended circuit based on a similarity metric measured between the dataset features. We validate this method on the bars and stripes dataset and carry out experiments on financial data. Our results underline the importance of problem-informed circuit design and show that the metric-based extension heuristic offers the means to introduce inductive bias while designing a circuit under limited resources.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11983'&gt;arXiv:2503.11983&lt;/a&gt;] Published Sat, 15 Mar 2025 03:45:22 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>A Bond weighted tensor renormalization group study of the q-state ferromagnetic Potts models on the square lattice</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12361</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Yuan-Heng Tseng, Shang-Wei Li, Fu-Jiun Jiang&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; It is known rigorously that the phase transition of the $q$-state ferromagnetic Potts model on the square lattice is second order for $q=4$. Despite this fact, some observables of the $q=4$ model show features of a first-order phase transition. For example, negative peak appears for the quantity of Binder ratio $Q_2$ of this model. Such a non-monotonic behavior of $Q_2$ is typically a consequence of phase coexistence, hence is served as a signal of a first-order phase transition. In particular, the negative peak should diverge with linear system size $L$ squared. Since the mentioned divergence phenomenon is not observed for the 4-state Potts model, the scenario of a first-order phase transition for this model is ruled out. Interestingly, a recent large scale Monte Carlo investigation of the 4-state Potts model observes that the two-peak structure of the energy density distribution becomes more noticeable when $L$ increases. This finding indicates the signal of coexistence of phases is getting stronger with $L$. Due to these unusual critical behaviors, here we study the energy density $E$ and the specific heat $C_v$ of the 4-state Potts model on the square lattice using the technique of bond weighted tensor renormalization group (BWTRG). For a comparison purpose, $q=2$ and $q=5$ ferromagnetic Potts models on the square lattice are investigated using the same method as well. Remarkably, our results do imply there may be a small energy gap for $q=4$ model. While the appearance of the mentioned small energy gap can be explained plausibly and it will disappear with a more sophisticated investigation, our finding suggests that whether a message of a first-order phase transition is genuine or is an artificial effect requires further and detailed investigations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12361'&gt;arXiv:2503.12361&lt;/a&gt;] Published Sun, 16 Mar 2025 04:54:38 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Efficient optimization and conceptual barriers in variational finite Projected Entangled-Pair States</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12557</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Daniel Alcalde Puente, Erik Lennart Weerda, Konrad Schröder, Matteo Rizzi&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Projected entangled pair states (PEPS) on finite two-dimensional lattices are a natural ansatz for representing ground states of local many-body Hamiltonians, as they inherently satisfy the boundary law of entanglement entropy. In this paper, we propose the optimization of PEPS via an improved formulation of the time-dependent variational principle (TDVP), namely the minimum-step stochastic-reconfguration scheme recently introduced for neural quantum states. We further discuss possible numerical issues that might arise in such a sampling-based approach. In this context, investigate the entanglement properties of random PEPS and find an entanglement phase transition. We note that on one side of this transition, we can identify positive random tensors as product states. To demonstrate the power of the framework described in this paper, we apply the PEPS to study the notoriously challenging chiral spin liquids. Moreover, we exhibit our approach's capability to naturally handle long-range interactions by exploring the phase diagram of Rydberg atom arrays with long-range interactions. We further provide parallelized easy-to-use code, allowing the straightforward application of our method to general Hamiltonians composed of local interaction terms.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12557'&gt;arXiv:2503.12557&lt;/a&gt;] Published Sun, 16 Mar 2025 16:06:44 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Emergent quasi-particles of spin-1 trimer chain</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12565</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Manodip Routh, Anutosh Biswas, Manoranjan Kumar&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The recent experimental realization of emergent quasi-particles, such as spinons, doublons, and quartons, in a spin-$1/2$ trimer chain has spurred new interest in low dimensional magnetic systems. In this study, we investigate the dynamical properties of the isotropic spin-$1$ trimer chain with intra and inter-trimer antiferromagnetic exchange couplings, ($J &gt;0$ and $J' &gt;0$), respectively, unveiling various quasi-particles: magnons, singletons, triplons, pentons, and heptons. For weak inter-trimer exchange coupling $J'/J \ll 1$, it behaves as an effective spin-$1$ chain with valence bond solid (VBS) ground state. Employing density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) techniques, we compute the dynamic structure factor (DSF) which reveals a gapped magnon band alongside weakly dispersive singleton, excited triplon, and penton excitations. The evolution of these excitations with inter-trimer coupling $J'$ is also examined, providing insight into the underlying excitation mechanisms. For spin-$1$ chain, these exotic quasi-particles eventually reduce to conventional magnon excitations as $J'/J \rightarrow 1$. Our results shed light on the rich and complex excitation spectrum of spin-$1$ trimer chains and offer new perspectives on the dynamics in quantum spin systems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12565'&gt;arXiv:2503.12565&lt;/a&gt;] Published Sun, 16 Mar 2025 16:41:48 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Non-equilibrium origin of cavity-induced resonant modifications of chemical reactivities</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12568</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Yaling Ke&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; In this work, we investigate the influence of light-matter coupling on reaction dynamics and equilibrium properties of a single molecule inside an optical cavity. The reactive molecule is modeled using a triple-well potential, allowing two competing reaction pathways that yield distinct products. Dynamical and equilibrium simulations are performed using the numerically exact hierarchical equations of motion approach in real- and imaginary-time formulations, respectively, both implemented with tree tensor network decomposition schemes. We consider two illustrative cases: one dominated by slow kinetics and another by ultrafast processes. Our results demonstrate that the rates of ground-state reaction pathways can be selectively enhanced when the cavity frequency is tuned into resonance with a vibrational transition directly leading to the formation of the corresponding product, even when that transition is spectroscopically dark. However, tuning cavity frequency to match an absorption-dominant transition shared across both reaction pathways does not necessarily result in pronounced rate enhancements and selectivity. Together with an additional analysis using an asymmetric double-well model, we highlight the greater complexity of underlying factors governing chemical reactivity, which extend beyond considerations of transition dipole strengths and thermal population distributions that shape linear spectroscopy. Furthermore, we found that in all scenarios, the equilibrium populations remain unchanged when the molecule is moved into the cavity, regardless of the cavity frequency. Thus, our study confirms at a fully quantum-mechanical level that cavity-induced modifications of chemical reactivities in resonant conditions arise from dynamical and non-equilibrium interactions between the cavity mode and molecular vibrations, rather than from the significant changes in equilibrium properties.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12568'&gt;arXiv:2503.12568&lt;/a&gt;] Published Sun, 16 Mar 2025 16:56:50 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Boundary Conditions for the Entanglement Cut in 2D Conformal Field Theories</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12674</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Ananda Roy, Sergei L. Lukyanov, Hubert Saleur&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The entanglement spectra for a subsystem in a spin chain fine-tuned to a quantum-critical point contains signatures of the underlying quantum field theory that governs its low-energy properties. For an open chain with given boundary conditions described by a 2D conformal field theory~(CFT), the entanglement spectrum of the left/right half of the system coincides with a boundary CFT spectrum, where one of the boundary conditions arise due to the `entanglement cut'. The latter has been argued to be conformal and has been numerically found to be the `free' boundary condition for Ising, Potts and free boson theories. For these models, the `free' boundary condition for the lattice degree of freedom has a counterpart in the continuum theory. However, this is not true in general. Here, this question is analyzed for the unitary minimal models of 2D CFTs using the density matrix renormalization group technique. The entanglement spectra are computed for blocks of spins in open chains of A-type restricted solid-on-solid models with identical boundary conditions at the ends. The imposed boundary conditions are realized exactly for these lattice models due to their integrable nature. The obtained entanglement spectra are in good agreement with certain boundary CFT spectra. The boundary condition for the entanglement cut is found to be conformal and to coincide with the one with the highest boundary entropy. This identification enables determination of the exponents governing the unusual corrections to the entanglement entropy from the CFT partition functions. These are compared with numerical results.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12674'&gt;arXiv:2503.12674&lt;/a&gt;] Published Sun, 16 Mar 2025 22:21:59 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Quantum-Enhanced LLM Efficient Fine Tuning</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12790</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Xiaofei Kong, Lei Li, Zhaoyun Chen, Cheng Xue, Xiaofan Xu, Huanyu Liu, Yuchun Wu, Yuan Fang, Han Fang, Kejiang Chen, Yang Yang, Menghan Dou, Guoping Guo&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) enables efficient fine-tuning of pre-trained language models through low-rank matrix approximation, achieving effectiveness in many scenarios. However, its representation capacity is constrained in complex tasks or high-rank dependency settings, potentially limiting model adaptability. To overcome the expressive bottleneck in classical low-rank approximation for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs), we propose Quantum Tensor Hybrid Adaptation (QTHA), a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method that integrates a quantum neural network (QNN) with a tensor network. QTHA explores quantum tensor hybrid fine-tuning within low-rank spaces by decomposing pre-trained weights into quantum neural network and tensor network representations, leveraging quantum state superposition to overcome classical rank limitations. Experiments demonstrate that QTHA achieves performance comparable to or surpassing LoRA in parameter-efficient fine-tuning. Compared to LoRA, QTHA reduces trainable parameters by 76% while reducing training loss by up to 17% and improving test set performance by up to 17% within the same training steps. This research not only enables lightweight adaptation of quantum resources to the billion-parameter models but also validates the feasibility of quantum hardware optimization driven by LLM tasks. It establishes the first engineering-ready foundation for future quantum-enhanced Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) systems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12790'&gt;arXiv:2503.12790&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 17 Mar 2025 03:59:26 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Stabilizer Rényi Entropy and Conformal Field Theory</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13599</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Masahiro Hoshino, Masaki Oshikawa, Yuto Ashida&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Understanding universal aspects of many-body systems is one of the central themes in modern physics. Recently, the stabilizer R\'{e}nyi entropy (SRE) has emerged as a computationally tractable measure of nonstabilizerness, a crucial resource for fault-tolerant universal quantum computation. While numerical results suggested that the SRE in critical states can exhibit universal behavior, its comprehensive theoretical understanding has remained elusive. In this work, we develop a field-theoretical framework for the SRE in a $(1+1)$-dimensional many-body system and elucidate its universal aspects using boundary conformal field theory. We demonstrate that the SRE is equivalent to a participation entropy in the Bell basis of a doubled Hilbert space, which can be calculated from the partition function of a replicated field theory with the interlayer line defect created by the Bell-state measurements. This identification allows us to characterize the universal contributions to the SRE on the basis of the data of conformal boundary conditions imposed on the replicated theory. We find that the SRE of the entire system contains a universal size-independent term determined by the noninteger ground-state degeneracy known as the g-factor. In contrast, we show that the mutual SRE exhibits the logarithmic scaling with a universal coefficient given by the scaling dimension of a boundary condition changing operator, which elucidates the origin of universality previously observed in numerical results. As a concrete demonstration, we present a detailed analysis of the Ising criticality, where we analytically derive the universal quantities at arbitrary R\'{e}nyi indices and numerically validate them with high accuracy by employing tensor network methods. These results establish a field-theoretical approach to understanding the universal features of nonstabilizerness in quantum many-body systems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13599'&gt;arXiv:2503.13599&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 17 Mar 2025 18:00:02 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Interpolation categories for Conformal Embeddings</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13641</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Cain Edie-Michell, Noah Snyder&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; In this paper we give a diagrammatic description of the categories of modules coming from the conformal embeddings $\mathcal{V}(\mathfrak{sl}_N,N) \subset \mathcal{V}(\mathfrak{so}_{N^2-1},1)$. A small variant on this construction (morally corresponding to a conformal embedding of $\mathfrak{gl}_N$ level $N$ into $\mathfrak{o}_{N^2-1}$ level $1$) has uniform generators and relations which are rational functions in $q = e^{2 \pi i/4N}$, which allows us to construct a new continuous family of tensor categories at non-integer level which interpolate between these categories. This is the second example of such an interpolation category for families of conformal embeddings after Zhengwei Liu's interpolation categories $\mathcal{V}(\mathfrak{sl}_N, N\pm 2) \subset \mathcal{V}(\mathfrak{sl}_{N(N\pm 1)/2},1)$ which he constructed using his classification Yang-Baxter planar algebras. Our approach is different from Liu's, we build a two-color skein theory, with one strand coming from $X$ the image of defining representation of $\mathfrak{sl}_N$ and the other strand coming from an invertible object $g$ in the category of local modules, and a trivalent vertex coming from a map $X \otimes X^* \rightarrow g$. We anticipate small variations on our approach will yield interpolation categories for every infinite discrete family of conformal embeddings.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13641'&gt;arXiv:2503.13641&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 17 Mar 2025 18:45:47 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

The algorithm is few-body revealing, namely it identifies the electronic orbitals that can be made inactive (in a trivial product state) by a time-dependent orbital rotation. Following a quench, we show that both the number of active orbitals and their associated matrix product state bond dimensions saturate to small values, leading to an algorithm dramatically more accurate and faster than the state of the art. We are thus able to follow the dynamics for thousands of fermions, up to the long-time stationary regime, and to study subtle aspects of quantum relaxation in the spatio-temporal domain, such as the emergence of entanglement structures in the Kondo screening cloud.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13706'&gt;arXiv:2503.13706&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 17 Mar 2025 20:24:46 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Quantum Strong-to-Weak Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking in Decohered One Dimensional Critical States</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14221</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Yuxuan Guo, Sheng Yang, Xue-Jia Yu&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Symmetry breaking has been a central theme in classifying quantum phases and phase transitions. Recently, this concept has been extended to the mixed states of open systems, attracting considerable attention due to the emergence of novel physics beyond closed systems. In this work, we reveal a new type of phase transition in mixed states, termed \emph{quantum} strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking (SWSSB). Using a combination of field theory calculations and large-scale matrix product state simulations, we map out the global phase diagram of the XXZ critical spin chain under local strong symmetry preserving decoherence, which features an SWSSB phase and a trivial Luttinger liquid phase, separated by a straight critical line that belongs to the boundary Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless universality class with a varying effective central charge. Importantly, we analyze this transition from two complementary perspectives: on one hand, through the behavior of order parameters that characterize the symmetry breaking; on the other hand, from a quantum information viewpoint by studying entropic quantities and the concept of quantum recoverability. Remarkably, the SWSSB transition in our case is \emph{purely quantum} in the sense that it can only be driven by tuning the Hamiltonian parameter even under arbitrary decoherence strength, fundamentally distinguishing it from the decoherence-driven SWSSB transitions extensively discussed in previous literature. Importantly, our unified theoretical framework is applicable to a broad class of one-dimensional quantum systems, including spin chains and fermionic systems, whose low-energy physics can be described by Luttinger liquid theory, under arbitrary symmetry-preserving decoherence channels. Finally, we also discuss the experimental relevance of our theory on quantum simulator platforms.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14221'&gt;arXiv:2503.14221&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 18 Mar 2025 12:59:17 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>pyTTN: An Open Source Toolbox for Open and Closed System Quantum Dynamics Simulations Using Tree Tensor Networks</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15460</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Lachlan P Lindoy, Daniel Rodrigo-Albert, Yannic Rath, Ivan Rungger&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We present the Python Tree Tensor Network package (pyTTN) for the evaluation of dynamical properties of closed and open quantum systems that makes use of Tree Tensor Network (TTN), or equivalently the multi-layer multiconfiguration time-dependent Hartree (ML-MCTDH), based representations of wavefunctions. This package includes several features allowing for easy setup of zero- and finite-temperature calculations for general Hamiltonians using single and multi-set TTN ans\"atze with an adaptive bond dimension through the use of subspace expansion techniques. All core features are implemented in C++ with Python bindings provided to simplify the use of this package. In addition to these core features, pyTTN provides several tools for setting up efficient simulation of open quantum system dynamics, including the use of the TTN ansatz to represent the auxiliary density operator space for the simulation of the Hierarchical Equation of Motion (HEOM) method and generalised pseudomode methods; furthermore we demonstrate that the two approaches are equivalent up to a non-unitary normal mode transformation acting on the pseudomode degrees of freedom. We present a set of applications of the package, starting with the widely used benchmark case of the photo-excitation dynamics of 24 mode pyrazine, following which we consider a more challenging model describing the exciton dynamics at the interface of a $n$-oligothiophene donor-C$_{60}$ fullerene acceptor system. Finally, we consider applications to open quantum systems, including the spin-boson model, a set of extended dissipative spin models, and an Anderson impurity model. By combining ease of use, an efficient implementation, as well as an extendable design allowing for the addition of future extensions, pyTTN can be integrated in a wide range of computational modelling software.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15460'&gt;arXiv:2503.15460&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 19 Mar 2025 17:40:49 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

Albert&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We define absolutely maximal entanglement (AME) in continuous-variable (CV) systems and show that, in stark contrast to qudit systems, this entanglement is generic among infinitely squeezed Gaussian states. In particular, we show that CV cluster states are generically AME and provide explicit constructions using Cauchy, Vandermonde, totally positive, and real-block-code generator matrices. Finitely squeezed versions of CV AME states give rise to open-destination multi-party CV teleportation, CV quantum secret sharing, CV majority-agreed key distribution, Gaussian perfect-tensor networks on arbitrary geometries, and Gaussian multi-unitary circuits.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15698'&gt;arXiv:2503.15698&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 19 Mar 2025 21:18:13 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Rapid quantum ground state preparation via dissipative dynamics</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15827</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Yongtao Zhan, Zhiyan Ding, Jakob Huhn, Johnnie Gray, John Preskill, Garnet Kin-Lic Chan, Lin Lin&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Inspired by natural cooling processes, dissipation has become a promising approach for preparing low-energy states of quantum systems. However, the potential of dissipative protocols remains unclear beyond certain commuting Hamiltonians. This work provides significant analytical and numerical insights into the power of dissipation for preparing the ground state of non-commuting Hamiltonians. For quasi-free dissipative dynamics, including certain 1D spin systems with boundary dissipation, our results reveal a new connection between the mixing time in trace distance and the spectral properties of a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, leading to an explicit and sharp bound on the mixing time that scales polynomially with system size. For more general spin systems, we develop a tensor network-based algorithm for constructing the Lindblad jump operator and for simulating the dynamics. Using this algorithm, we demonstrate numerically that dissipative ground state preparation protocols can achieve rapid mixing for certain 1D local Hamiltonians under bulk dissipation, with a mixing time that scales logarithmically with the system size. We then prove the rapid mixing result for certain weakly interacting spin and fermionic systems in arbitrary dimensions, extending recent results for high-temperature quantum Gibbs samplers to the zero-temperature regime. Our theoretical approaches are applicable to systems with singular stationary states, and are thus expected to have applications beyond the specific systems considered in this study.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15827'&gt;arXiv:2503.15827&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 20 Mar 2025 03:27:52 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Reducing T Gates with Unitary Synthesis</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15843</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Tianyi Hao, Amanda Xu, Swamit Tannu&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Quantum error correction is essential for achieving practical quantum computing but has a significant computational overhead. Among fault-tolerant (FT) gate operations, non-Clifford gates, such as $T$, are particularly expensive due to their reliance on magic state distillation. These costly $T$ gates appear frequently in FT circuits as many quantum algorithms require arbitrary single-qubit rotations, such as $R_x$ and $R_z$ gates, which must be decomposed into a sequence of $T$ and Clifford gates. In many quantum circuits, $R_x$ and $R_z$ gates can be fused to form a single $U3$ unitary. However, existing synthesis methods, such as gridsynth, rely on indirect decompositions, requiring separate $R_z$ decompositions that result in a threefold increase in $T$ count. This work presents a novel FT synthesis algorithm that directly synthesizes arbitrary single-qubit unitaries, avoiding the overhead of separate $R_z$ decompositions. By leveraging tensor network-based search, our approach enables native $U3$ synthesis, reducing the $T$ count, Clifford gate count, and approximation error. Compared to gridsynth-based circuit synthesis, for 187 representative benchmarks, our design reduces the $T$ count by up to $3.5\times$, and Clifford gates by $7\times$, resulting in up to $4\times$ improvement in overall circuit infidelity.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15843'&gt;arXiv:2503.15843&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 20 Mar 2025 04:53:54 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

Kuchkin&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We study the low-energy excitation spectra of a spin-1/2 quantum Heisenberg model with a monoaxial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. Using the density matrix renormalization group method, our analysis reveals a degeneracy between skyrmion and antiskyrmion states, enabling the formation of a mesoscopic Schr\"odinger cat state - a quantum superposition of these topologically distinct textures. To characterize this nontrivial state, we compute two-point spin correlation functions, highlighting signatures accessible via neutron scattering experiments. Furthermore, we demonstrate that applying a magnetic field gradient induces a coherent time evolution of the cat state, offering a controllable mechanism for its manipulation. These findings provide a framework for the detection of skyrmionic Schr\"odinger cat states in quantum magnets.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16020'&gt;arXiv:2503.16020&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 20 Mar 2025 10:36:52 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Many exact area-law scar eigenstates in the nonintegrable PXP and related models</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16327</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Andrew N. Ivanov, Olexei I. Motrunich&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; In this work, we present new, highly non-trivial area-law exact zero-energy eigenstates of the one-dimensional (1D) PXP and related models. We formulate sufficient conditions for a matrix product state to represent an exact zero-energy eigenstate of a given 1D kinetically constrained model and use them to prove our new states. We also demonstrate that all previously known exact eigenstates of PXP-type models satisfy these conditions, and, in fact, can be directly deduced from them. We discuss and demonstrate a remarkably effective general numerical technique for discovering finite-bond-dimension eigenstates residing in degenerate subspaces of a broad class of Hamiltonians. Our results highlight a previously unrecognized structure characteristic of the exponentially large nullspaces in kinetically constrained models, suggesting the possibly of extensively many increasingly complex area-law zero-energy eigenstates in the thermodynamic limit. The important implications of these emergent exact eigenstates for the general thermalization phenomenology are exemplified by one of the states introduced in this work, which we propose is a member of the primary $\mathbb{Z}_2$ quantum many-body scar tower responsible for long-lived revivals in the Rydberg atom chain experiment.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16327'&gt;arXiv:2503.16327&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 20 Mar 2025 16:52:11 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Ergodic behaviors in reversible 3-state cellular automata</title>

With the goal to uncover different physically distinct classes of ergodic behavior, we perform a systematic study of three-state cellular automata (with a stable `vacuum' state and `particles' with $\pm$ charges). The classification is aided by the automata's different transformation properties under discrete symmetries: charge conjugation, spatial parity and time reversal. In particular, we propose a simple classification that distinguishes between types and levels of ergodic behavior in such system as quantified by the following observables: the mean return time, the number of conserved quantities, and the scaling of correlation functions. In each of the physically distinct classes, we present examples and discuss some of their phenomenology. This includes chaotic or ergodic dynamics, phase-space fragmentation, Ruelle-Pollicott resonances, existence of quasilocal charges, and anomalous transport with a variety of dynamical exponents.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16593'&gt;arXiv:2503.16593&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 20 Mar 2025 17:55:59 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Tensor Cross Interpolation of Purities in Quantum Many-Body Systems</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17230</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Dmytro Kolisnyk, Raimel A. Medina, Romain Vasseur, Maksym Serbyn&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; A defining feature of quantum many-body systems is the exponential scaling of the Hilbert space with the number of degrees of freedom. This exponential complexity na\"ively renders a complete state characterization, for instance via the complete set of bipartite Renyi entropies for all disjoint regions, a challenging task. Recently, a compact way of storing subregions' purities by encoding them as amplitudes of a fictitious quantum wave function, known as entanglement feature, was proposed. Notably, the entanglement feature can be a simple object even for highly entangled quantum states. However the complexity and practical usage of the entanglement feature for general quantum states has not been explored. In this work, we demonstrate that the entanglement feature can be efficiently learned using only a polynomial amount of samples in the number of degrees of freedom through the so-called tensor cross interpolation (TCI) algorithm, assuming it is expressible as a finite bond dimension MPS. We benchmark this learning process on Haar and random MPS states, confirming analytic expectations. Applying the TCI algorithm to quantum eigenstates of various one dimensional quantum systems, we identify cases where eigenstates have entanglement feature learnable with TCI. We conclude with possible applications of the learned entanglement feature, such as quantifying the distance between different entanglement patterns and finding the optimal one-dimensional ordering of physical indices in a given state, highlighting the potential utility of the proposed purity interpolation method.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17230'&gt;arXiv:2503.17230&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 21 Mar 2025 15:33:00 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Solving tiling enumeration problems by tensor network contractions</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Kai Liang&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; This paper presents an algorithm for computing the contraction of two-dimensional tensor networks on a square lattice; and we combine it with solving congruence equations to compute the exact enumeration (including weighted enumeration) of Wang tilings. Based on this, the paper demonstrates how to transform other tiling enumeration problems (such as those of polyominoes) into Wang tiling enumeration problems, thereby solving them using this algorithm. Our algorithm extends the sequence length records for dozens of sequences defined by polyomino tiling enumeration on chessboards on the OEIS website, covering numerous of different polyomino sets, including I-polyominoes, tetrominoes, pentominoes, etc. This demonstrates the high efficiency and strong universality of the algorithm for solving exact tiling enumeration problems. In addition, the theory and techniques used in the algorithm establish a bridge between tensor network contractions and tiling enumeration, where the former provides a theoretical foundation for solving problems in the latter, while the latter offers an intuitive combinatorial interpretation of the former.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17698'&gt;arXiv:2503.17698&lt;/a&gt;] Published Sat, 22 Mar 2025 08:40:26 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Tensor-based homogeneous polynomial dynamical system analysis from data</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17774</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Xin Mao, Anqi Dong, Ziqin He, Yidan Mei, Shenghan Mei, Can Chen&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Numerous complex real-world systems, such as those in biological, ecological, and social networks, exhibit higher-order interactions that are often modeled using polynomial dynamical systems or homogeneous polynomial dynamical systems (HPDSs). However, identifying system parameters and analyzing key system-theoretic properties remain challenging due to their inherent nonlinearity and complexity, particularly for large-scale systems. To address these challenges, we develop an innovative computational framework in this article that leverages advanced tensor decomposition techniques, namely tensor train and hierarchical Tucker decompositions, to facilitate efficient identification and analysis of HPDSs that can be equivalently represented by tensors. Specifically, we introduce memory-efficient system identification techniques for directly estimating system parameters represented through tensor decompositions from time-series data. Additionally, we develop necessary and sufficient conditions for determining controllability and observability using the tensor decomposition-based representations of HPDSs, accompanied by detailed complexity analyses that demonstrate significant reductions in computational demands. The effectiveness and efficiency of our framework are validated through numerical examples.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17774'&gt;arXiv:2503.17774&lt;/a&gt;] Published Sat, 22 Mar 2025 13:57:39 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Emergent supercounterfluid and quantum phase diagram of two-component interacting bosons in one-dimensional optical lattice</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18154</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Saisai He, Yang Liu, Bin Xi, Hong-Gang Luo, Qiang Luo, Jize Zhao&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Motivated by a recent experiment that realizes nearest-neighbor dipolar couplings in an optical lattice [C. Lagoin, $\textit{et al.}$, Nature $\textbf{609}$, 485 (2022)], we study a one-dimensional version of the two-component extended Bose-Hubbard model via the density-matrix renormalization group method. By using the nearest-neighbor and on-site interaction parameters from the experiment, we start by mapping the quantum phase diagram in the hopping parameters $t_{A}\mbox{-}t_{B}$ plane with boson densities $\rho_{A}=\rho_{B}=1/2$. In addition to the density wave phase reported in the experiment, we find several regimes of superfluidity when one or two hopping parameters are large enough, and interestingly there is a supercounterfluid phase at moderate and comparable hopping parameters. The universality classes of these phase transitions are analyzed from the correlation functions, excitation gaps, and entanglement entropy. In particular, a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless type is recognized several gapped-to-gapless transitions. In addition, we also study the quantum phase transitions when varying $\rho_{B}$ from 0 to 1 while keeping $\rho_A = 1/2$. We identify a supersolid phase in a wide range of $1/2&lt;\rho_B&lt;1$. Our work paves the way for realizing exotic many-body phases in cold atom experiments upon proper tuning of experimental parameters.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18154'&gt;arXiv:2503.18154&lt;/a&gt;] Published Sun, 23 Mar 2025 17:48:15 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

Although Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) has established itself as a pillar for simulating one-dimensional quantum systems, its application to 2D systems has long been hindered by the notorious ``local minimum'' issues. Recent methodological breakthroughs have addressed this challenge by incorporating Gutzwiller-projected wavefunctions as initial states for DMRG simulations. This hybrid approach, referred to as DMRG guided by Gutzwiller-projected wave functions (or Gutzwiller-guided DMRG), has demonstrated remarkable improvements in accuracy, efficiency, and the ability to explore exotic quantum phases such as topological orders. This review examines the theoretical underpinnings of this approach, details key algorithmic developments, and showcases its applications in recent studies of 2D quantum systems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18374'&gt;arXiv:2503.18374&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 24 Mar 2025 06:14:01 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

In this study, we investigate the finite-temperature properties of two-dimensional square-lattice Rydberg atom arrays using the projected entangled pair states (PEPS) method. By analyzing the thermal behavior of systems in the checkerboard and striated phases, we extract critical exponents and identify phase transition characteristics. Our results confirm that the checkerboard phase transition belongs to the 2D Ising universality class, while the striated phase exhibits critical exponents that deviate from known universality classes, possibly due to finite-size effects. These findings provide theoretical insights into the thermal stability of quantum phases in Rydberg atom arrays and offer valuable guidance for future experimental efforts.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18413'&gt;arXiv:2503.18413&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 24 Mar 2025 07:45:22 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Screening in Hubbard models with long-range interactions</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18639</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Florian Gebhard, Kevin Bauerbach, Örs Legeza&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We provide solid evidence for the long-standing presumption that model Hamiltonians with short-range interactions faithfully reproduce the physics of the long-range Coulomb interaction in real materials. For this aim, we address a generic Hubbard model that captures the quantum phase transitions between metal, Mott insulator, and charge-density-wave insulator, in the absence of Fermi-surface nesting. By comparing the quantum phase diagrams for the $1/r$-Hubbard model on a half-filled chain with nearest-neighbor and $1/r$-long-range interactions, we argue that the inclusion of long-range interactions is not crucial for a proper description of interacting many-electron systems. To this end, we employ the Density Matrix Renormalization Group method on finite lattices and antiperiodic boundary conditions to determine the quantum phase transitions between the metallic Luttinger liquid for weak interactions, the Mott-Hubbard insulator for dominant on-site interactions, and the charge-density wave insulator for dominant inter-site interactions. The two phase diagrams qualitatively agree inasmuch as the quantum phase transitions are continuous in both cases. Moreover, simple Hartree-Fock theory and the atomic limit provide renormalization factors that allow us to quantitatively map the two phase diagrams onto each other. As a practical advantage, our findings imply that computational efforts can be reduced tremendously by using models with short-range interactions only.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18639'&gt;arXiv:2503.18639&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 24 Mar 2025 13:05:03 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Random quantum Ising model with three-spin couplings</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Ferenc Iglói, Yu-Cheng Lin&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We apply a real-space block renormalization group approach to study the critical properties of the random transverse-field Ising spin chain with multispin interactions. First we recover the known properties of the traditional model with two-spin interactions by applying the renormalization approach for arbitrary size of the block. For the model with three-spin couplings we calculate the critical point and demonstrate that the phase transition is controlled by an infinite disorder fixed point. We have determined the typical correlation-length critical exponent, which seems to be different from that of the random transverse Ising chain with nearest-neighbor couplings. Thus this model represents a new infinite disorder universality class.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18690'&gt;arXiv:2503.18690&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 24 Mar 2025 13:59:09 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Efficient QR-Based CP Decomposition Acceleration via Dimension Tree and Extrapolation</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18759</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Wenchao Xie, Jiawei Xu, Zheng Peng, Qingsong Wang&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The canonical polyadic (CP) decomposition is one of the most widely used tensor decomposition techniques. The conventional CP decomposition algorithm combines alternating least squares (ALS) with the normal equation. However, the normal equation is susceptible to numerical ill-conditioning, which can adversely affect the decomposition results. To mitigate this issue, ALS combined with QR decomposition has been proposed as a more numerically stable alternative. Although this method enhances stability, its iterative process involves tensor-times-matrix (TTM) operations, which typically result in higher computational costs. To reduce this cost, we propose branch reutilization of dimension tree, which increases the reuse of intermediate tensors and reduces the number of TTM operations. This strategy achieves a $33\%$ reduction in computational complexity for third and fourth order tensors. Additionally, we introduce a specialized extrapolation method in CP-ALS-QR algorithm, leveraging the unique structure of the matrix $\mathbf{Q}_0$ to further enhance convergence. By integrating both techniques, we develop a novel CP decomposition algorithm that significantly improves efficiency. Numerical experiments on five real-world datasets show that our proposed algorithm reduces iteration costs and enhances fitting accuracy compared to the CP-ALS-QR algorithm.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18759'&gt;arXiv:2503.18759&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 24 Mar 2025 15:07:37 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Simulation of Fermionic circuits using Majorana Propagation</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18939</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Aaron Miller, Zoë Holmes, Özlem Salehi, Rahul Chakraborty, Anton Nykänen, Zoltán Zimborás, Adam Glos, Guillermo García-Pérez&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We introduce Majorana Propagation, an algorithmic framework for the classical simulation of Fermionic circuits. Inspired by Pauli Propagation, Majorana Propagation operates by applying successive truncations throughout the Heisenberg evolution of the observable. We identify monomial length as an effective truncation strategy for typical, unstructured circuits by proving that high-length Majorana monomials are exponentially unlikely to contribute to expectation values and the backflow of high-length monomials to lower-length monomials is quadratically suppressed. Majorana Propagation can be used either independently, or in conjunction with quantum hardware, to simulate Fermionic systems relevant to quantum chemistry and condensed matter. We exemplify this by using Majorana Propagation to find circuits that approximate ground states for strongly correlated systems of up to 52 Fermionic modes. Our results indicate that Majorana Propagation is orders of magnitude faster and more accurate than state-of-the-art tensor-network-based circuit simulators.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18939'&gt;arXiv:2503.18939&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 24 Mar 2025 17:58:38 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Tensor-network study of the roughening transition in a (2 + 1)D $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theory with matter</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19027</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Wen-Tao Xu, Michael Knap, Frank Pollmann&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Within the confined phase of (2+1)D lattice gauge theories a roughening transition arises between a weakly confined regime with floppy string excitations and a strongly confined regime with stiff string excitations. In this work, we use an infinite Density Matrix Renormalization Group (iDMRG) algorithm to quantitatively characterize the properties of confined strings. To this end, we stabilize the state with a string excitation by 't Hooft loop operators. While for zero gauge-matter coupling we can use bare 't Hooft loop operators to do so, for finite gauge-matter coupling we have to transform them to emergent ones, which we achieve with an adiabatic protocol. By analyzing the scaling of both a novel order parameter and the entanglement entropy, our approach allows us to accurately determine the roughening transition, even at finite gauge-matter coupling.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19027'&gt;arXiv:2503.19027&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 24 Mar 2025 18:00:04 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Dynamics of one-dimensional spin models via complex-time evolution of tensor networks</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19269</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Jeong Hyeok Cha, Hyun-Yong Lee, Heung-Sik Kim&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Studying the real-time dynamics of strongly correlated systems poses significant challenges, which have recently become more manageable thanks to advances in density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) and tensor network methods. A notable development in this area is the introduction of a complex-time evolution scheme for tensor network states, originally suggested for solving Anderson impurity model and designed to suppress the growth of entanglement under time evolution. In this study, we employ the complex-time evolution scheme to investigate the dynamics of one-dimensional spin systems, specifically the transverse-field Ising model (TFIM) and the XXZ model. Our analysis revisits the dynamic critical exponent $z$ of the TFIM and explores the dynamical structure factor in both gapped and gapless states of the XXZ model. Importantly, the complex-time evolution reproduces the results of real-time evolution while mitigating the rapid growth of quantum entanglement typically associated with the latter. These results demonstrate that the combination of complex-time evolution and extrapolation provides a robust and efficient framework for studying the dynamics of complex quantum systems, enabling more comprehensive insights into their behavior.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19269'&gt;arXiv:2503.19269&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 25 Mar 2025 02:04:13 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Emergent Pair Density Wave Order Across a Lifshitz Transition</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Luhang Yang, Elbio Dagotto, Adrian E. Feiguin&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We numerically investigate the telltale signs of pair-density-wave order (PDW) in the Kondo-Heisenberg chain by focusing on the momentum resolved spectrum in different parameter regimes. Density matrix renormalization group calculations reveal that this phase is characterized by a dispersion with two minima and four Fermi points, indicating the emergence of an effective next-nearest-neighbor hopping that arises as a second-order effect to avoid magnetic frustration. The pairs appear in the spectrum as in-gap bound states with weight concentrated in the hole pockets. The low-energy physics can be understood by means of a generalized $t-J$ model with next-nearest-neighbor hopping. Our results offer a guide for searching for experimental signatures, and for other models that can realize PDW physics.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19761'&gt;arXiv:2503.19761&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 25 Mar 2025 15:26:37 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Single-band Triangular Lattice Hubbard Model with Tunable Anisotropy from Twisted Diamond Homobilayers</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19829</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Wen Sun, Chuyi Tuo, Hong Yao&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The ground-state properties of the single-band triangular lattice Hubbard model with hopping anisotropy and strong interactions remain elusive so far. Here we show that twisted diamond homobilayers with band extrema at $Y$ valley can realize weakly-coupled chains with quasi-1D band structure; applying displacement field generates interchain hopping, transforming this quasi-1D system into a 2D one. The low-energy physics can be described by localized Wannier functions on the triangular lattice with tunable hopping anisotropy, providing a promising platform for studying the anisotropic triangular lattice Hubbard model. We further employ density matrix renormalization group to study this model with interaction $U=10t$ and anisotropy $0.5\leq t'/t\leq 1.5$ at half filling, and obtain a rich ground state phase diagram, including a chiral spin liquid phase, non-magnetic phases, and a N\'eel antiferromagnetic phase. This work provides a first realization of displacement-field tuned anisotropy in a single-band triangular Hubbard model within moir\'e systems, establishing them as a promising platform to investigate intriguing correlated physics with tunable anisotropy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19829'&gt;arXiv:2503.19829&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 25 Mar 2025 16:43:34 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Variational M-Partite Geometric Entanglement Algorithm</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Vahid Azimi-Mousolou, Prashant Singh&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We propose a variational quantum algorithm to evaluate the $M$-partite geometric entanglement across arbitrary partitions of an $N$-qubit system into $M$ parties. By constructing tailored variational ansatz circuits for both single- and multi-qubit parties, we optimize the overlap between a target quantum state and an $M$-partite variational separable state. This method provides a flexible and scalable approach for characterizing arbitrary $M$-partite entanglement in complex quantum systems of a given dimension. We assess the accuracy of the proposed method by reproducing known analytical results and demonstrate its capability to evaluate entanglement among $M$ parties for any given conventional or unconventional partitions of one- and two-dimensional spin systems, both near and at a quantum critical point. Our results establish the versatility of the variational approach in capturing different types of entanglement in various quantum systems, surpassing the capabilities of existing methods. Our approach offers a powerful methodology for advancing research in quantum information science, condensed matter physics, and quantum field theory. Additionally, we discuss its advantages, highlighting its adaptability to diverse system architectures in the context of near-term quantum devices.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20056'&gt;arXiv:2503.20056&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 25 Mar 2025 20:33:44 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Symmetry resolved out-of-time-order correlators of Heisenberg spin chains using projected matrix product operators</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20327</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Martina Gisti, David J. Luitz, Maxime Debertolis&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We extend the concept of operator charge in the context of an abelian U (1) symmetry and apply this framework to symmetry-preserving matrix product operators (MPOs), enabling the description of operators projected onto specific sectors of the corresponding symmetry. Leveraging this representation, we study the effect of interactions on the scrambling of information in an integrable Heisenberg spin chain, by controlling the number of particles. Our focus lies on out-of-time order correlators (OTOCs) which we project on sectors with a fixed number of particles. This allows us to link the non-interacting system to the fully-interacting one by allowing more and more particle to interact with each other, keeping the interaction parameter fixed. While at short times, the OTOCs are almost not affected by interactions, the spreading of the information front becomes gradually faster and the OTOC saturate at larger values as the number of particle increases. We also study the behavior of finite-size systems by considering the OTOCs at times beyond the point where the front hits the boundary of the system. We find that in every sector with more than one particle, the OTOCs behave as if the local operator was rotated by a random unitary matrix, indicating that the presence of boundaries contributes to the maximal scrambling of local operators.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20327'&gt;arXiv:2503.20327&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 26 Mar 2025 08:54:20 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Accurate Gauge-Invariant Tensor Network Simulations for Abelian Lattice Gauge Theory in (2+1)D: ground state and real-time dynamics</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20566</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Yantao Wu, Wen-Yuan Liu&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We propose a novel tensor network method to achieve accurate and efficient simulations of Abelian lattice gauge theories (LGTs) in (2+1)D for both ground state and real-time dynamics. The first key is to identify a gauge canonical form (GCF) of gauge-invariant tensor network states, which already simplifies existing algorithms for (1+1)D LGTs. The second key is to employ the GCF of projected entangled-pair state (PEPS) combining with variational Monte Carlo (VMC), enabling efficient computations for (2+1)D LGTs. We demonstrate the versatile capability of this approach for accurate ground state simulation of pure $Z_2$, $Z_3$ and $Z_4$ gauge theory, odd-$Z_2$ gauge theories, and $Z_2$ gauge theory coupled to hard-core bosons, on square lattices up to $32 \times 32$. Furthermore, we demonstrate that it allows for accurate simulations of real-time dynamics up to long-time, exemplified by the dynamics of elementary excitations of the deconfined $Z_2$ gauge field on a $10\times10$ lattice. This is also the first example of using VMC to simulate the real-time dynamics of PEPS, whose impact may extend beyond gauge theory.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20566'&gt;arXiv:2503.20566&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 26 Mar 2025 14:04:21 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

Xantheas, Martin Ganahl, Frank Neese&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We present an efficient orbital optimization procedure that combines the highly GPU accelerated, spin-adapted density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) method with the complete active space self-consistent field (CAS-SCF) approach for quantum chemistry implemented in the ORCA program package. Leveraging the computational power of the latest generation of Nvidia GPU hardware, we perform CAS-SCF based orbital optimizations for unprecedented CAS sizes of up to 82 electrons in 82 orbitals [CAS(82,82)] in molecular systems comprising of active spaces sizes of hundreds of electrons in thousands of orbitals. For both the NVIDIA DGX-A100 and DGX-H100 hardware, we provide a detailed scaling and error analysis of our DMRG-SCF approach for benchmark systems consisting of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and iron-sulfur complexes of varying sizes. Our efforts demonstrate for the first time that highly accurate DMRG calculations at large bond dimensions are critical for obtaining reliably converged CAS-SCF energies. For the more challenging iron-sulfur benchmark systems, we furthermore find the optimized orbitals of a converged CAS-SCF calculation to depend more sensitively on the DMRG parameters than those for the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. The ability to obtain converged CAS-SCF energies and orbitals for active spaces of such large sizes within days reduces the challenges of including the appropriate orbitals into the CAS or selecting the correct minimal CAS, and may open up entirely new avenues for tackling strongly correlated molecular systems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20700'&gt;arXiv:2503.20700&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 26 Mar 2025 16:29:44 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

Birgitta Whaley&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We prove classical simulation hardness, under the generalized $\mathsf{P}\neq\mathsf{NP}$ conjecture, for quantum circuit families with applications in near-term chemical ground state estimation. The proof exploits a connection to particle number conserving matchgate circuits with fermionic magic state inputs, which are shown to be universal for quantum computation under post-selection, and are therefore not classically simulable in the worst case, in either the strong (multiplicative) or weak (sampling) sense. We apply this result to quantum multi-reference methods designed for near-term hardware by ruling out certain dequantization strategies for computing the off-diagonal matrix elements. We demonstrate these quantum speedups for two choices of reference state that incorporate both static and dynamic correlations to model the electronic eigenstates of molecular systems: orbital-rotated matrix product states, which are preparable in linear depth, and generalized unitary coupled-cluster with single and double excitations, for which computing the off-diagonal matrix elements is $\mathsf{BQP}$-complete for any polynomial depth. In each case we discuss the implications for achieving exponential quantum advantage in quantum chemistry on near-term hardware.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21041'&gt;arXiv:2503.21041&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 26 Mar 2025 23:15:32 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

Here, we use Quantinuum's H2 quantum computer to simulate digitized dynamics of the quantum Ising model and observe the emergence of Floquet prethermalization on timescales where accurate simulations using current classical methods are extremely challenging (if feasible at all). In addition to confirming the stability of dynamics subject to achievable digitization errors, we show direct evidence of the resultant local equilibration by computing diffusion constants associated with an emergent hydrodynamic description of the dynamics. Our results were enabled by continued advances in two-qubit gate quality (native partial entangler fidelities of 99.94(1)%) that allow us to access circuit volumes of over 2000 two-qubit gates. This work establishes digital quantum computers as powerful tools for studying continuous-time dynamics and demonstrates their potential to benchmark classical heuristics in a regime of scale and complexity where no known classical methods are both efficient and trustworthy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20870'&gt;arXiv:2503.20870&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 26 Mar 2025 18:00:02 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Quantum Coherence of Topologically Frustrated Spin Chains</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; S. B. Kožić, G. Torre, K. Delić, F. Franchini, S. M. Giampaolo&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The study of entanglement and magic properties in topologically frustrated systems suggests that, in the thermodynamic limit, these quantities decompose into two distinct contributions. One is determined by the specific nature of the model and its Hamiltonian, and another arises from topological frustration itself, resulting in being independent of the Hamiltonian's parameters. In this work, we test the generality of this picture by investigating an additional quantum resource, namely quantum coherence, in two different models where topological frustration is induced through an appropriate choice of boundary conditions. Our findings reveal a perfect analogy between the behavior of quantum coherence and that of other quantum resources, particularly magic, providing further evidence in support of the universality of this picture and the topological nature of this source of frustration.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20874'&gt;arXiv:2503.20874&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 26 Mar 2025 18:00:05 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Solvable Quantum Circuits in Tree+1 Dimensions</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20927</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Oliver Breach, Benedikt Placke, Pieter W. Claeys, S. A. Parameswaran&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We devise tractable models of unitary quantum many-body dynamics on tree graphs, as a first step towards a deeper understanding of dynamics in non-Euclidean spaces. To this end, we first demonstrate how to construct strictly local quantum circuits that preserve the symmetries of trees, such that their dynamical light cones grow isotropically. For trees with coordination number z, such circuits can be built from z-site gates. We then introduce a family of gates for which the dynamics is exactly solvable; these satisfy a set of constraints that we term 'tree-unitarity'. Notably, tree-unitarity reduces to the previously-established notion of dual-unitarity for z = 2, when the tree reduces to a line. Among the unexpected features of tree-unitarity is a trade-off between 'maximum butterfly velocity' dynamics of out-of-time-order correlators and the existence of non-vanishing correlation functions in multiple directions, a tension absent in one-dimensional dual-unitary models and their Euclidean generalizations. We connect the existence of (a wide class of) solvable dynamics with non-maximal butterfly velocity directly to a property of the underlying circuit geometry called $\delta$-hyperbolicity, and argue that such dynamics can only arise in non-Euclidean geometries. We give various examples of tree-unitary gates, discuss dynamical correlations, out-of-time-order correlators, and entanglement growth, and show that the kicked Ising model on a tree is a physically-motivated example of maximum-velocity tree-unitary dynamics.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20927'&gt;arXiv:2503.20927&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 26 Mar 2025 19:00:01 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Dynamic scaling and Family-Vicsek universality in $SU(N)$ quantum spin chains</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21454</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Cătălin Paşcu Moca, Balázs Dóra, Doru Sticlet, Angelo Valli, Tomaž Prosen, Gergely Zaránd&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The Family-Vicsek scaling is a fundamental framework for understanding surface growth in non-equilibrium classical systems, providing a universal description of temporal surface roughness evolution. While universal scaling laws are well established in quantum systems, the applicability of Family-Vicsek scaling in quantum many-body dynamics remains largely unexplored. Motivated by this, we investigate the infinite-temperature dynamics of one-dimensional $SU(N)$ spin chains, focusing on the well-known $SU(2)$ XXZ model and the $SU(3)$ Izergin-Korepin model. We compute the quantum analogue of classical surface roughness using the second cumulant of spin fluctuations and demonstrate universal scaling with respect to time and subsystem size. By systematically breaking global $SU(N)$ symmetry and integrability, we identify distinct transport regimes characterized by the dynamical exponent $z$: (i) ballistic transport with $z=1$, (ii) superdiffusive transport with the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang exponent $z=3/2$, and (iii) diffusive transport with the Edwards-Wilkinson exponent $z=2$. Notably, breaking integrability always drives the system into the diffusive regime. Our results demonstrate that Family-Vicsek scaling extends beyond classical systems, holding universally across quantum many-body models with $SU(N)$ symmetry.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21454'&gt;arXiv:2503.21454&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 27 Mar 2025 12:44:06 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>F-INR: Functional Tensor Decomposition for Implicit Neural Representations</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21507</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Sai Karthikeya Vemuri, Tim Büchner, Joachim Denzler&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Implicit Neural Representation (INR) has emerged as a powerful tool for encoding discrete signals into continuous, differentiable functions using neural networks. However, these models often have an unfortunate reliance on monolithic architectures to represent high-dimensional data, leading to prohibitive computational costs as dimensionality grows. We propose F-INR, a framework that reformulates INR learning through functional tensor decomposition, breaking down high-dimensional tasks into lightweight, axis-specific sub-networks. Each sub-network learns a low-dimensional data component (e.g., spatial or temporal). Then, we combine these components via tensor operations, reducing forward pass complexity while improving accuracy through specialized learning. F-INR is modular and, therefore, architecture-agnostic, compatible with MLPs, SIREN, WIRE, or other state-of-the-art INR architecture. It is also decomposition-agnostic, supporting CP, TT, and Tucker modes with user-defined rank for speed-accuracy control. In our experiments, F-INR trains $100\times$ faster than existing approaches on video tasks while achieving higher fidelity (+3.4 dB PSNR). Similar gains hold for image compression, physics simulations, and 3D geometry reconstruction. Through this, F-INR offers a new scalable, flexible solution for high-dimensional signal modeling.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21507'&gt;arXiv:2503.21507&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 27 Mar 2025 13:51:31 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Prethermalization by Random Multipolar Driving on a 78-Qubit Superconducting Processor</title>

Yet, drive-induced heating normally destabilizes the systems, which can be parametrically suppressed in the high-frequency regime by using periodic (Floquet) drives. It remains largely unknown to what extent highly controllable quantum simulators can suppress heating in non-periodically driven systems. Using the 78-qubit superconducting quantum processor, Chuang-tzu 2.0, we report the experimental observation of long-lived prethermal phases in many-body systems with tunable heating rates, driven by structured random protocols, characterized by $n$-multipolar temporal correlations. By measuring both the particle imbalance and subsystem entanglement entropy, we monitor the entire heating process over 1,000 driving cycles and observe the existence of the prethermal plateau. The prethermal lifetime is `doubly tunable': one way by driving frequency, the other by multipolar order; it grows algebraically with the frequency with the universal scaling exponent $2n{+}1$. Using quantum state tomography on different subsystems, we demonstrate a non-uniform spatial entanglement distribution and observe a crossover from area-law to volume-law entanglement scaling. With 78 qubits and 137 couplers in a 2D configuration, the entire far-from-equilibrium heating dynamics are beyond the reach of simulation using tensor-network numerical techniques. Our work highlights superconducting quantum processors as a powerful platform for exploring universal scaling laws and non-equilibrium phases of matter in driven systems in regimes where classical simulation faces formidable challenges.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21553'&gt;arXiv:2503.21553&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 27 Mar 2025 14:40:09 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Extracting Coupling-Mode Spectral Densities with Two-Dimensional Electronic Spectroscopy</title>

Chin&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Methods for reconstructing the spectral density of a vibrational environment from experimental data can yield key insights into the impact of the environment on molecular function. Although such experimental methods exist, they generally only access vibrational modes that couple diagonally to the electron system. Here we present a method for extracting the spectral density of modes that couple to the transition between electronic states, using two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy. To demonstrate this, we use a process-tensor method that can simulate two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy measurements in a numerically exact way. To explain how the extraction works, we also derive an approximate analytical solution, which illustrates that the non-Markovianity of the environment plays an essential role in the existence of the simulated signal.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21685'&gt;arXiv:2503.21685&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 27 Mar 2025 16:53:56 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Taking the temperature of quantum many-body scars</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21884</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Phillip C. Burke, Shane Dooley&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; A quantum many-body scar is an eigenstate of a chaotic many-body Hamiltonian that exhibits two seemingly incongruous properties: its energy eigenvalue corresponds to a high temperature, yet its entanglement structure resembles that of low-temperature eigenstates, such as ground states. Traditionally, a temperature is assigned to an energy \emph{eigenvalue} through the textbook canonical temperature-energy relationship. However, in this work, we use the \emph{eigenstate subsystem temperature} -- a recently developed quantity that assigns a temperature to an energy eigenstate, based on the structure of its reduced density matrix. For a thermal state, the eigenstate subsystem temperature is approximately equal to its canonical temperature. Given that quantum many-body scars have a ground-state-like entanglement structure, it is not immediately clear that their eigenstate subsystem temperature would be close to their canonical temperature. Surprisingly, we find that this is the case: the quantum many-body scars have approximate ``knowledge'' of their position in the spectrum encoded within their state structure.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21884'&gt;arXiv:2503.21884&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 27 Mar 2025 18:01:18 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

McCulloch&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Spontaneous symmetry breaking with type-B Goldstone modes is investigated in the SO($2s+1$) ferromagnetic model. A set of orthonormal basis states in the ground state subspace are constructed, which admit an exact Schmidt decomposition, exposing self-similarities in real space of an abstract fractal underlying the ground state subspace. Focusing on the SO(5) and the SO(6) ferromagnetic spin chains as illustrative examples, finite system-size scaling analysis of the entanglement entropy for this set of orthonormal basis states confirms that the entanglement entropy scales logarithmically with block size in the thermodynamic limit. The prefactor in front of the logarithm is half the number of type-B Goldstone modes $N_B$, which is identified as the fractal dimension $d_f$ for these orthonormal basis states. For the SO($2s+1$) ferromagnetic model $N_B = d_f =s$ for integer $s$ and $N_B = d_f =s+1/2$ for half-odd-integer $s$.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22468'&gt;arXiv:2503.22468&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 28 Mar 2025 14:29:11 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Charge creation via quantum tunneling in one-dimensional Mott insulators: A numerical study of the extended Hubbard model</title>

In this work, we conduct a systematic numerical analysis of quantum tunneling in one-dimensional Mott insulators described by the extended ($U$-$V$) Hubbard model. We discuss the applicability of the analytical formula for doublon-holon (DH) pair production, previously derived for the one-dimensional Hubbard model, which highlights the relationship between the tunneling threshold, the charge gap, and the correlation length. We test the formulas ability to predict both DH pair production and energy increase rate. Using tensor-network-based approaches, we demonstrate that the formula provides accurate predictions in the absence of excitonic states facilitated by the nearest-neighbor interaction $V$. However, when excitonic states emerge, the formula more accurately describes the rate of energy increase than the DH pair creation rate and in both cases gets improved by incorporating the exciton energy as the effective gap.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22481'&gt;arXiv:2503.22481&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 28 Mar 2025 14:43:45 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>The moment polytope of matrix multiplication is not maximal</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Maxim van den Berg, Matthias Christandl, Vladimir Lysikov, Harold Nieuwboer, Michael Walter, Jeroen Zuiddam&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Moment polytopes of tensors, the study of which is deeply rooted in invariant theory, representation theory and symplectic geometry, have found relevance in numerous places, from quantum information (entanglement polytopes) and algebraic complexity theory (GCT program and the complexity of matrix multiplication) to optimization (scaling algorithms). Towards an open problem in algebraic complexity theory, we prove separations between the moment polytopes of matrix multiplication tensors and unit tensors. As a consequence, we find that matrix multiplication moment polytopes are not maximal, i.e. are strictly contained in the corresponding Kronecker polytope. As another consequence, we obtain a no-go result for a natural operational characterization of moment polytope inclusion in terms of asymptotic restriction. We generalize the separation and non-maximality to moment polytopes of iterated matrix multiplication tensors. Our result implies that tensor networks where multipartite entanglement structures beyond two-party entanglement are allowed can go beyond projected entangled-pair states (PEPS) in terms of expressivity. Our proof characterizes membership of uniform points in moment polytopes of tensors, and establishes a connection to polynomial multiplication tensors via the minrank of matrix subspaces. As a result of independent interest, we extend these techniques to obtain a new proof of the optimal border subrank bound for matrix multiplication.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22633'&gt;arXiv:2503.22633&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 28 Mar 2025 17:25:06 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Detection of anyon braiding through pump-probe spectroscopy</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22792</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Xu Yang, Ryan Buechele, Nandini Trivedi&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We show that the braiding of anyons in a quantum spin liquid leaves a distinct dynamical signature in the nonlinear pump-probe response. Using a combination of exact diagonalization and matrix product state techniques, we study the nonlinear pump-probe response of the toric code in a magnetic field, a model which hosts mobile electric $e$ and magnetic $m$ anyonic excitations. While the linear response signal oscillates and decays with time like $\sim t^{-1.3}$, the amplitude of the nonlinear signal for $\chi^{(3)}_{XZZ}$ features a linear-in-time enhancement at early times. The comparison between $\chi^{(3)}_{XZZ}$, which involves the non-trivial braiding of $e$ and $m$ anyons, and $\chi^{(3)}_{XXX}$ that involves the trivial braiding of the same types of anyons, serves to distinguish the braiding statistics of anyons. We support our analysis by constructing a hard-core anyon model with statistical gauge fields to develop further insights into the time dependence of the pump-probe response. Pump-probe spectroscopy provides a distinctive new probe of quantum spin liquid states, beyond the inconclusive broad features observed in single spin flip inelastic neutron scattering.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22792'&gt;arXiv:2503.22792&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 28 Mar 2025 18:00:03 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

Multi-objective optimization can be challenging classically, even if the corresponding single-objective optimization problems are efficiently solvable. Thus, multi-objective optimization represents a compelling problem class to analyze with quantum computers. In this work, we use low-depth Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm to approximate the optimal Pareto front of certain multi-objective weighted maximum cut problems. We demonstrate its performance on an IBM Quantum computer, as well as with Matrix Product State numerical simulation, and show its potential to outperform classical approaches.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22797'&gt;arXiv:2503.22797&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 28 Mar 2025 18:00:25 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Xun Tang, Lexing Ying&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We introduce a novel numerical scheme for solving the Fokker-Planck equation of discretized Dean-Kawasaki models with a functional tensor network ansatz. The Dean-Kawasaki model describes density fluctuations of interacting particle systems, and it is a highly singular stochastic partial differential equation. By performing a finite-volume discretization of the Dean-Kawasaki model, we derive a stochastic differential equation (SDE). To fully characterize the discretized Dean-Kawasaki model, we solve the associated Fokker-Planck equation of the SDE dynamics. In particular, we use a particle-based approach whereby the solution to the Fokker-Planck equation is obtained by performing a series of density estimation tasks from the simulated trajectories, and we use a functional hierarchical tensor model to represent the density. To address the challenge that the sample trajectories are supported on a simplex, we apply a coordinate transformation from the simplex to a Euclidean space by logarithmic parameterization, after which we apply a sketching-based density estimation procedure on the transformed variables. Our approach is general and can be applied to general density estimation tasks over a simplex. We apply the proposed method successfully to the 1D and 2D Dean-Kawasaki models. Moreover, we show that the proposed approach is highly accurate in the presence of external potential and particle interaction.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22816'&gt;arXiv:2503.22816&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 28 Mar 2025 18:27:59 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

As a practical example, we introduce a coupled-cluster inspired framework to produce approximate Hamiltonian moments, and demonstrate its application in various linear algebra algorithms for ground state estimation. Through numerical examples, we illustrate the difference between the ground-state energies arising from quantum many-body linear algebra and those from the analogous many-body perturbation theory. Our results support the general idea of designing quantum many-body approximations outside of perturbation theory, providing a route to new algorithms and approximations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22908'&gt;arXiv:2503.22908&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 28 Mar 2025 23:04:33 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Kazumi Okuyama&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We construct a holographic tensor network for the double-scaled SYK model (DSSYK). The moment of the transfer matrix of DSSYK can be mapped to the matrix product state (MPS) of a spin chain. By adding the height direction as a holographic direction, we recast the MPS for DSSYK into the holographic tensor network whose building block is a 4-index tensor with the bond dimension three.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23003'&gt;arXiv:2503.23003&lt;/a&gt;] Published Sat, 29 Mar 2025 07:53:13 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Revealing quantum phase string effect in doped Mott-insulator: a tensor network state approach</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23851</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Wayne Zheng, Jia-Xin Zhang, Zheng-Yuan Yue, Zheng-Cheng Gu, Zheng-Yu Weng&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We apply the fermionic tensor network (TN) state method to understand the strongly correlated nature in a doped Mott insulator. We conduct a comparative study of the $\sigma t$-$J$ model, in which the no-double-occupancy constraint remains unchanged but the quantum phase string effect associated with doped holes is precisely switched off. Thus, the ground state of the $\sigma t$-$J$ model can serve as a well-controlled reference state of the standard $t$-$J$ model. In the absence of phase string, the spin long-range antiferromagnetic (AFM) order is found to be essentially decoupled from the doped holes, and the latter contribute to a Fermi-liquid-like compressibility and a coherent single-particle propagation with a markedly reduced pairing tendency. In contrast, our TN calculations of the $t$-$J$ model indicate that the AFM order decreases much faster with doping and the single-particle propagation of doped holes gets substantially suppressed, concurrently with a much stronger charge compressibility at small doping and a significantly amplified Cooper pairing tendencies. These findings demonstrate that quantum many-body interference from phase strings plays a pivotal role in the $t$-$J$ model, mediating long-range entanglement between spin and charge degrees of freedom.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23851'&gt;arXiv:2503.23851&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 31 Mar 2025 08:55:55 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Krylov complexity in quantum many-body scars of spin-1 models</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24073</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Qingmin Hu, Wen-Yi Zhang, Yunguang Han, Wen-Long You&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Weak ergodicity breaking, particularly through quantum many-body scars (QMBS), has become a significant focus in many-body physics. Krylov state complexity quantifies the spread of quantum states within the Krylov basis and serves as a powerful diagnostic for analyzing nonergodic dynamics. In this work, we study spin-one XXZ magnets and reveal nonergodic behavior tied to QMBS. For the XY model, the nematic N\'eel state exhibits periodic revivals in Krylov complexity. In the generic XXZ model, we identify spin helix states as weakly ergodicity-breaking states, characterized by low entanglement and nonthermal dynamics. Across different scenarios, the Lanczos coefficients for scarred states display an elliptical pattern, reflecting a hidden SU(2) algebra that enables analytical results for Krylov complexity and fidelity. These findings, which exemplify the rare capability to characterize QMBS analytically, are feasible with current experimental techniques and offer deep insights into the nonergodic dynamics of interacting quantum systems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24073'&gt;arXiv:2503.24073&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 31 Mar 2025 13:29:45 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Quantum phase diagram of the extended spin-3/2 Kitaev-Heisenberg model: A DMRG study</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24246</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Gui-Xin Liu, Ting-Long Wang, Yi-Fan Jiang&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Recently there has been considerable excitement surrounding the promising realization of high-spin Kitaev material, such as the quasi-2D compound CrI$_3$ and CrGeTe$_3$. However, the stability of quantum spin liquids (QSL) against single ion anisotropy (SIA) in these materials and the global quantum phase diagram of the extended spin-3/2 Kitaev model with finite SIA remain unclear. In this study, we perform large-scale density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) to explore the quantum phase diagram of the generalized spin-3/2 Kitaev-Heisenberg (K-H) model accompanied with SIA $A_c$. In the $A_c=0$ limit, the spin-3/2 K-H model exhibits a quantum phase diagram similar to that of a spin-1/2 system, including two QSLs around antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic Kitaev models. For models with finite $A_c$, we map out the quantum phase diagram around two Kitaev points and observe distinct types of in-plane vortex orders developed from these two QSL phases. Interestingly, series of nearly degenerate vortex configurations are discovered in each vortex phases. Using linear spin-wave theory, we demonstrate that these vortex configurations can be understood as a consequence of the quantum correction on a continuous family of degenerate classical states.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24246'&gt;arXiv:2503.24246&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 31 Mar 2025 15:58:20 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Quantum Methods for Managing Ambiguity in Natural Language Processing</title>

Wiggins&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The Categorical Compositional Distributional (DisCoCat) framework models meaning in natural language using the mathematical framework of quantum theory, expressed as formal diagrams. DisCoCat diagrams can be associated with tensor networks and quantum circuits. DisCoCat diagrams have been connected to density matrices in various contexts in Quantum Natural Language Processing (QNLP). Previous use of density matrices in QNLP entails modelling ambiguous words as probability distributions over more basic words (the word \texttt{queen}, e.g., might mean the reigning queen or the chess piece). In this article, we investigate using probability distributions over processes to account for syntactic ambiguity in sentences. The meanings of these sentences are represented by density matrices. We show how to create probability distributions on quantum circuits that represent the meanings of sentences and explain how this approach generalises tasks from the literature. We conduct an experiment to validate the proposed theory.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00040'&gt;arXiv:2504.00040&lt;/a&gt;] Published Sun, 30 Mar 2025 19:10:37 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Spin order, spin excitations, and RIXS spectra of spin-1/2 tetramer chains</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00095</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Junli Li, Jun-Qing Cheng, Trinanjan Datta, Dao-Xin Yao&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We investigate the spin dynamics of a 1D spin-1/2 Heisenberg tetramer chain. Employing a combination of Density Matrix Renormalization Group, quantum renormalization group, and perturbation theory techniques, we compute the energy levels and the quantum phase diagram, analyze the phase transitions, and evaluate the $L$ and $K$ -edge resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) spectrum of fractionalized and collective (single and multi-particle) excitations. Our calculations suggest that the chain can transition between a hidden $Z_2\times Z_2$ discrete symmetry preserving tetramer phase and a Haldane phase with non-vanishing string order that breaks the hidden symmetry. These two gapped phases are intervened by an intermediate deconfined quantum critical state comprising of free spins and three-site doublets, which is a gapless critical phase with deconfined spinons. We find that the tetramer chain can support fractionalized (spinon) and collective (triplon and quinton) excitations. In the ferromagnetic intra-tetramer limit, the chain can support a quinton excitation which has a five-fold degenerate excited state. String order parameter calculations suggest CuInVO$_5$ to be in a Haldane-like phase whose $L$ -edge RIXS spectrum can support observable triplon and quinton excitations. We also identify possible two-particle excitations (two-singlon, two-triplon, triplon-quinton, and two-quinton excitations) resulting from the double spin-flip effect in the $K$ -edge RIXS spectrum.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00095'&gt;arXiv:2504.00095&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 31 Mar 2025 18:00:07 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>On Infinite Tensor Networks, Complementary Recovery and Type II Factors</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00096</link>

In particular, we consider tensor networks in which each layer acts as a quantum code with complementary recovery, a property that features prominently in the bulk-to-boundary maps intrinsic to holographic quantum error-correcting codes. In this case, we decompose the limiting Hilbert space and the algebras of observables in a way that keeps track of the entanglement in the network. As a specific example, we describe this inductive limit for the holographic HaPPY code model and relate its algebraic and error-correction features. We find that the local algebras in this model are given by the hyperfinite type II$_\infty$ factor. Next, we discuss other networks that build upon this framework and comment on a connection between type II factors and stabilizer circuits. We conclude with a discussion of MERA networks in which complementary recovery is broken. We argue that this breaking possibly permits a limiting type III von Neumann algebra, making them more suitable ans\"atze for approximating subregions of quantum field theories.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00096'&gt;arXiv:2504.00096&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 31 Mar 2025 18:00:09 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>SCRec: A Scalable Computational Storage System with Statistical Sharding and Tensor-train Decomposition for Recommendation Models</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00520</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Jinho Yang, Ji-Hoon Kim, Joo-Young Kim&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Deep Learning Recommendation Models (DLRMs) play a crucial role in delivering personalized content across web applications such as social networking and video streaming. However, with improvements in performance, the parameter size of DLRMs has grown to terabyte (TB) scales, accompanied by memory bandwidth demands exceeding TB/s levels. Furthermore, the workload intensity within the model varies based on the target mechanism, making it difficult to build an optimized recommendation system. In this paper, we propose SCRec, a scalable computational storage recommendation system that can handle TB-scale industrial DLRMs while guaranteeing high bandwidth requirements. SCRec utilizes a software framework that features a mixed-integer programming (MIP)-based cost model, efficiently fetching data based on data access patterns and adaptively configuring memory-centric and compute-centric cores. Additionally, SCRec integrates hardware acceleration cores to enhance DLRM computations, particularly allowing for the high-performance reconstruction of approximated embedding vectors from extremely compressed tensor-train (TT) format. By combining its software framework and hardware accelerators, while eliminating data communication overhead by being implemented on a single server, SCRec achieves substantial improvements in DLRM inference performance. It delivers up to 55.77$\times$ speedup compared to a CPU-DRAM system with no loss in accuracy and up to 13.35$\times$ energy efficiency gains over a multi-GPU system.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00520'&gt;arXiv:2504.00520&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 01 Apr 2025 08:12:45 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Exact Diagonalization, Matrix Product States and Conformal Perturbation Theory Study of a 3D Ising Fuzzy Sphere Model</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00842</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Andreas M. Läuchli, Loïc Herviou, Patrick H. Wilhelm, Slava Rychkov&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Numerical studies of phase transitions in statistical and quantum lattice models provide crucial insights into the corresponding Conformal Field Theories (CFTs). In higher dimensions, comparing finite-volume numerical results to infinite-volume CFT data is facilitated by choosing the sphere $S^{d-1}$ as the spatial manifold. Recently, the fuzzy sphere regulator in Ref. [Zhu et al, Phys. Rev. X 13 021009 (2023)] has enabled such studies with exact rotational invariance, yielding impressive agreement with known 3D Ising CFT predictions, as well as new results. However, systematic improvements and a deeper understanding of finite-size corrections remain essential. In this work, we revisit the fuzzy sphere regulator, focusing on the original Ising model, with two main goals. First, we assess the robustness of this approach using Conformal Perturbation Theory (CPT), to which we provide a detailed guidebook. We demonstrate how CPT provides a unified framework for determining the critical point, the speed of light, and residual deviations from CFT predictions. Applying this framework, we study finite-size corrections and clarify the role of tuning the model in minimizing these effects. Second, we develop a novel method for extracting Operator Product Expansion (OPE) coefficients from fuzzy sphere data. This method leverages the sensitivity of energy levels to detuning from criticality, providing new insights into level mixing and avoided crossings in finite systems. Our work also includes validation of CPT in a 1+1D Ising model away from the integrable limit.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00842'&gt;arXiv:2504.00842&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 01 Apr 2025 14:29:26 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>LimTDD: A Compact Decision Diagram Integrating Tensor and Local Invertible Map Representations</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01168</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Xin Hong, Aochu Dai, Dingchao Gao, Sanjiang Li, Zhengfeng Ji, Mingsheng Ying&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Tensor networks serve as a powerful tool for efficiently representing and manipulating high-dimensional data in applications such as quantum physics, machine learning, and data compression. Tensor Decision Diagrams (TDDs) offer an efficient framework for tensor representation by leveraging decision diagram techniques. However, the current implementation of TDDs and other decision diagrams fail to exploit tensor isomorphisms, limiting their compression potential. This paper introduces Local Invertible Map Tensor Decision Diagrams (LimTDDs), an extension of TDDs that incorporates local invertible maps (LIMs) to achieve more compact representations. Unlike LIMDD, which uses Pauli operators for quantum states, LimTDD employs the $XP$-stabilizer group, enabling broader applicability across tensor-based tasks. We present efficient algorithms for normalization, slicing, addition, and contraction, critical for tensor network applications. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that LimTDDs achieve greater compactness than TDDs and, in best-case scenarios and for quantum state representations, offer exponential compression advantages over both TDDs and LIMDDs. Experimental results in quantum circuit tensor computation and simulation confirm LimTDD's superior efficiency.

We consider four representative models in detail: the domain-wall (DW) Fredrickson-Andersen (FA), the DW East, the ZZZ-FA, and the XOR-FA models. Using numerical tensor networks, we build the LD phase diagrams of these models in terms of the softness of the constraint and the counting field conjugate to the dynamical activity. In all cases, we find distinct dynamical phases separated by phase transitions along the self-dual lines, revealing the presence of multi-critical points that delimit first-order from continuous active-inactive transitions. We discuss connections to supersymmetry and possible extensions to higher spin and space dimensions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01258'&gt;arXiv:2504.01258&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 02 Apr 2025 00:10:57 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Low-energy structure and topology of the two-band Hubbard-Kanamori model</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Nayara G. Gusmão, Germán Blesio, Armando Aligia, Walber H. Brito, Maria C. O. Aguiar, Karen Hallberg&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We investigate the Mott transition in a two-band Hubbard-Kanamori model using Dynamical Mean-Field Theory (DMFT) with the Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) and the Numerical Renormalization Group (NRG) as impurity solvers. Our study focuses on the case where the intraorbital and interorbital Coulomb interactions are equal (U = U2) and the Hund's coupling is absent (J = 0). Spectral analysis confirms the absence of an orbital-selective Mott transition (OSMT), even in systems with significantly different bandwidths (t1 and t2 for the wide and narrow bands, respectively), indicating a simultaneous Mott transition in both bands. Notably, the NRG results reveal the emergence of a pseudo-gap-like feature and a central peak in the narrow band, whose characteristics depend on the hopping parameter t2. These spectral features may serve as precursors to OSMT in more realistic systems with finite Hund's coupling (J &gt; 0). Furthermore, in the Mott insulating phase, the self-energies of both bands diverge, suggesting that the Mott transition represents a topological phase transition. Our results highlight the crucial role of accurate impurity solvers in capturing the density of states and detailed spectral structures.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01269'&gt;arXiv:2504.01269&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 02 Apr 2025 00:36:46 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Topological Phase Transition in the Two-Leg Hubbard Model: Emergence of the Haldane Phase via Diagonal Hopping and Strong Interactions</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02157</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; João Pedro Gama D'Elia, Thereza Paiva&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We investigate the two-leg Hubbard model with diagonal hopping to explore the interplay between geometrical frustration and strong electron-electron interactions. Using the Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) method, we demonstrate the emergence of a topological Haldane phase, which results explicitly from the complementary effects of diagonal hopping-induced frustration and strong on-site Coulomb repulsion. The topological phase transition from a trivial insulator to the nontrivial Haldane phase is characterized by significant changes in magnetic properties, edge correlations, and the appearance of a nonzero string order parameter. Furthermore, we confirm the topological nature of this phase through a detailed analysis of the spin gap and entanglement spectrum, demonstrating clear signatures of symmetry-protected topological order.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02157'&gt;arXiv:2504.02157&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 02 Apr 2025 22:13:27 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Perturbative Variational Quantum Eigensolver based on Reduced Density Matrix Method</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02340</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Yuhan Zheng, Yibin Guo, Huili Zhang, Jie Liu, Xiongzhi Zeng, Xiaoxia Cai, Zhenyu Li, Jinlong Yang&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Current noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices lack the quantum resources required for practical applications. To address this, we propose the perturbative variational quantum eigensolver (PT-VQE). In PT-VQE, VQE is used to capture key correlations within a carefully selected active space, while perturbation theory efficiently incorporates interactions in the remaining space, without requiring additional qubits or circuit depth. When the VQE-optimized state closely approximates the true ground state in the active space, excitations cannot act solely in the active space, since their contributions to perturbative correction are negligible. This reduces the highest-order required RDM from 4-RDM to 3-RDM, significantly reducing computational costs. We validate PT-VQE by calculating the ground-state potential energy surfaces (PESs) of $\rm{HF}$ and $\rm{N}_2$, as well as the ground-state energy of ferrocene ($\rm{Fe(C_5H_5)_2}$). Additionally, PT-VQE is performed on a quantum computer to compute the PES of ${\rm F}_2$. The consistent results obtained from both PT-VQE with the highest 3-RDM and 4-RDM confirm the reliability of the constraint. PT-VQE significantly outperforms standard VQE, achieving chemical accuracy. This method offers a resource-efficient and practical approach for accurate quantum simulations of larger systems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02340'&gt;arXiv:2504.02340&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 03 Apr 2025 07:20:20 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Finite steady-state current defies non-Hermitian many-body localization</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02460</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Pietro Brighi, Marko Ljubotina, Federico Roccati, Federico Balducci&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Non-Hermitian many-body localization (NH MBL) has emerged as a possible scenario for stable localization in open systems, as suggested by spectral indicators identifying a putative transition for finite system sizes. In this work, we shift the focus to dynamical probes, specifically the steady-state spin current, to investigate transport properties in a disordered, non-Hermitian XXZ spin chain. Through exact diagonalization for small systems and tensor-network methods for larger chains, we demonstrate that the steady-state current remains finite and decays exponentially with disorder strength, showing no evidence of a transition up to disorder values far beyond the previously claimed critical point. Our results reveal a stark discrepancy between spectral indicators, which suggest localization, and transport behavior, which indicates delocalization. This highlights the importance of dynamical observables in characterizing NH MBL and suggests that traditional spectral measures may not fully capture the physics of non-Hermitian systems. Additionally, we observe a non-commutativity of limits in system size and time, further complicating the interpretation of finite-size studies. These findings challenge the existence of NH MBL in the studied model and underscore the need for alternative approaches to understand localization in non-Hermitian settings.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02460'&gt;arXiv:2504.02460&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 03 Apr 2025 10:24:39 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Bootstrapping the Electronic Structure of Quantum Materials</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02861</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Anna O. Schouten, Simon Ewing, David A. Mazziotti&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The last several decades have seen significant advances in the theoretical modeling of materials within the fields of solid-state physics and materials science, but many methods commonly applied to this problem struggle to capture strong electron correlation accurately. Recent widespread interest in quantum materials -- where strong correlation plays a crucial role in the quantum effects governing their behavior -- further highlights the need for theoretical methods capable of rigorously treating such correlation. Here, we present a periodic generalization of variational two-electron reduced density matrix (2-RDM) theory, a bootstrapping-type method that minimizes the ground-state energy as a functional of the 2-RDM without relying on the wavefunction. The 2-RDM is computed directly by semidefinite programming with $N$-representability conditions, ensuring accurate treatment of strongly correlated electronic systems. By exploiting translational symmetry, we significantly reduce computational scaling, enabling applications to realistic materials-scale systems. Additionally, we introduce an alternative to conventional energy band structures: natural-orbital occupation-number bands, which, being independent of mean-field assumptions, offer deeper insights into electron correlation effects. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach by applying the theory to hydrogen chains, molybdenum disulfide, and nickel oxide, showing that natural-orbital occupation bands correctly capture electronic character in regimes where density functional theory fails. This work represents a major step toward accurately describing the electronic structure of quantum materials using reduced density matrices rather than wavefunctions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02861'&gt;arXiv:2504.02861&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 31 Mar 2025 17:04:41 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

This phase exhibits doublon-holon pairing correlations with opposite signs along the rung and chain directions, reminiscent of d-wave pairing in chemically doped ladder systems. By constructing the phase diagram, we reveal that the doublon-holon pairing state emerges between the spin-singlet phase and the charge-density-wave/$\eta$-pairing phase. Our study suggests that the interplay of charge, spin, and $\eta$-spin degrees of freedom can give rise to exotic quantum many-body states in photodoped Mott insulators.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03324'&gt;arXiv:2504.03324&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 04 Apr 2025 10:08:46 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Symmetrizing the Constraints -- Density Matrix Renormalization Group for Constrained Lattice Models</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Ting-Tung Wang, Xiaoxue Ran, Zi Yang Meng&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We develop a density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) algorithm for constrained quantum lattice models that successfully {\it{implements the local constraints as symmetries in the contraction of the matrix product states and matrix product operators}}. Such an implementation allows us to investigate a quantum dimer model in DMRG for any lattice geometry wrapped around a cylinder with substantial circumference. We have thence computed the ground state phase diagram of the quantum dimer model on triangular lattice, with the symmetry-breaking characteristics of the columnar solid phase and $\sqrt{12}\times\sqrt{12}$ valence bond solid phase fully captured, as well as the topological entanglement entropy of the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ quantum spin liquid phase that extends to the RK point on non-bipartite lattice accurately revealed. Our DMRG algorithm on constrained quantum lattice models opens new opportunities for matrix and tensor-based algorithms for these systems that have immediate relevance towards the frustrated quantum magnets and synthetic quantum simulators.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04035'&gt;arXiv:2504.04035&lt;/a&gt;] Published Sat, 05 Apr 2025 03:05:11 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Scalable simulation of random quantum circuits using projected entangled-pair states</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04769</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Sung-Bin B. Lee, Hee Ryang Choi, Daniel Donghyon Ohm, Seung-Sup B. Lee&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Classical simulation of a programmable quantum processor is crucial in identifying the threshold of a quantum advantage. We use the simple update of projected entangled-pair states (PEPSs) in the Vidal gauge to simulate the states of random quantum circuits (RQCs), which center around recent quantum advantage claims. Applied to square lattices of qubits akin to state-of-the-art superconducting processors, our PEPS simulation is exact for circuit depths less than $D_\mathrm{tr}$ = $\beta\log_2\chi$, where $\chi$ is the maximum bond dimension and $2 \lesssim \beta \lesssim 4$ depends on the choice of two-qubit gates, independent of the qubit number $n$. We find the universal scaling behaviors of the state fidelity by performing large-scale simulations for $n \leq 10^{4}$ or $\chi \leq 128$ on a conventional CPU. Our method has computational cost scaling polynomially with $n$ for circuit depth $D =O(\log n)$ and is more advantageous than matrix product state (MPS) approaches if $n$ is large. This work underscores PEPSs as a scalable tool for benchmarking quantum algorithms, with future potential for sampling applications using advanced contraction techniques.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04769'&gt;arXiv:2504.04769&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 07 Apr 2025 06:47:48 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

In this study, we focus on probabilistic imaginary-time evolution (PITE) algorithm and derive its formulation in the context of state-vector-based simulations, where quantum state vectors are directly used to compute observables without statistical errors. We compare the results with those of shot-based simulations, which estimate observables through repeated projective measurements. Applying the PITE algorithm to the Heisenberg chain, we investigate optimal initial conditions for convergence. We further demonstrate the method on the transverse-field Ising model using a state-of-the-art trapped-ion quantum device. Finally, we explore the potential of error mitigation in this framework, highlighting practical considerations for near-term digital quantum simulations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04958'&gt;arXiv:2504.04958&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 07 Apr 2025 11:45:31 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Benchmarking vibrational spectra: 5000 accurate eigenstates of acetonitrile using tree tensor network states</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Henrik R. Larsson&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Accurate vibrational spectra are essential for understanding how molecules behave, yet their computation remains challenging and benchmark data to reliably compare different methods are sparse. Here, we present high-accuracy eigenstate computations for the six-atom, 12-dimensional acetonitrile molecule, a prototypical, strongly coupled, anharmonic system. Using a density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) algorithm with a tree-tensor-network-state (TTNS) ansatz, a refinement using TTNSs as basis set, and reliable procedures to estimate energy errors, we compute up to 5,000 vibrational states with error estimates below 0.0007 $\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$. Our analysis reveals that previous works underestimated the energy error by up to two orders of magnitude. Our data serve as a benchmark for future vibrational spectroscopy methods and our new method offers a path toward similarly precise computations of large, complex molecular systems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05382'&gt;arXiv:2504.05382&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 07 Apr 2025 18:00:02 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

By addressing scaling bottlenecks, FMPS enables more efficient simulation of shallow, multi-mode CV quantum circuits with non-Gaussian input states. The method is validated by simulating random shallow and cascaded circuits with highly non-Gaussian input states, showing superior performance compared to existing techniques, also in the presence of loss.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05860'&gt;arXiv:2504.05860&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 08 Apr 2025 09:37:19 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Comparative Analysis of Classical and Quantum-Inspired Solvers: A Preliminary Study on the Weighted Max-Cut Problem</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05989</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Aitor Morais, Eneko Osaba, Iker Pastor, Izaskun Oregui&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Combinatorial optimization is essential across numerous disciplines. Traditional metaheuristics excel at exploring complex solution spaces efficiently, yet they often struggle with scalability. Deep learning has become a viable alternative for quickly generating high-quality solutions, particularly when metaheuristics underperform. In recent years, quantum-inspired approaches such as tensor networks have shown promise in addressing these challenges. Despite these advancements, a thorough comparison of the different paradigms is missing. This study evaluates eight algorithms on Weighted Max-Cut graphs ranging from 10 to 250 nodes. Specifically, we compare a Genetic Algorithm representing metaheuristics, a Graph Neural Network for deep learning, and the Density Matrix Renormalization Group as a tensor network approach. Our analysis focuses on solution quality and computational efficiency (i.e., time and memory usage). Numerical results show that the Genetic Algorithm achieves near-optimal results for small graphs, although its computation time grows significantly with problem size. The Graph Neural Network offers a balanced solution for medium-sized instances with low memory demands and rapid inference, yet it exhibits more significant variability on larger graphs. Meanwhile, the Tensor Network approach consistently yields high approximation ratios and efficient execution on larger graphs, albeit with increased memory consumption.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05989'&gt;arXiv:2504.05989&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 08 Apr 2025 12:51:49 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

Sandvik, Gonzalo Alvarez, Juan Carrasquilla, Marcel Franz, Mohammad H. Amin&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; In a recent preprint [1] (arXiv:2503.05693), Tindall et al. presented impressive classical simulations of quantum dynamics using tensor networks. Their methods represent a significant improvement in the classical state of the art, and in some cases show lower errors than recent simulations of quantum dynamics using a quantum annealer [2] (King et al., Science, eado6285, 2025). However, of the simulations in Ref. [2], Ref. [1] did not attempt the most complex lattice geometry, nor reproduce the largest simulations in 3D lattices, nor simulate the longest simulation times, nor simulate the low-precision ensembles in which correlations grow the fastest, nor produce the full-state and fourth-order observables produced by Ref. [2]. Thus this work should not be misinterpreted as having overturned the claim of Ref. [2]: the demonstration of quantum simulations beyond the reach of classical methods. Rather, these classical advances narrow the parameter space in which beyond-classical computation has been demonstrated. In the near future these classical methods can be combined with quantum simulations to help sharpen the boundary between classical and quantum simulability.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06283'&gt;arXiv:2504.06283&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 25 Mar 2025 17:52:08 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>FETTA: Flexible and Efficient Hardware Accelerator for Tensorized Neural Network Training</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06474</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Jinming Lu, Jiayi Tian, Hai Li, Ian Young, Zheng Zhang&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The increasing demand for on-device training of deep neural networks (DNNs) aims to leverage personal data for high-performance applications while addressing privacy concerns and reducing communication latency. However, resource-constrained platforms face significant challenges due to the intensive computational and memory demands of DNN training. Tensor decomposition emerges as a promising approach to compress model size without sacrificing accuracy. Nevertheless, training tensorized neural networks (TNNs) incurs non-trivial overhead and severe performance degradation on conventional accelerators due to complex tensor shaping requirements. To address these challenges, we propose FETTA, an algorithm and hardware co-optimization framework for efficient TNN training. On the algorithm side, we develop a contraction sequence search engine (CSSE) to identify the optimal contraction sequence with the minimal computational overhead. On the hardware side, FETTA features a flexible and efficient architecture equipped with a reconfigurable contraction engine (CE) array to support diverse dataflows. Furthermore, butterfly-based distribution and reduction networks are implemented to perform flexible tensor shaping operations during computation. Evaluation results demonstrate that FETTA achieves reductions of 20.5x/100.9x, 567.5x/45.03x, and 11609.7x/4544.8x in terms of processing latency, energy, and energy-delay product (EDP) over GPU and TPU, respectively. Moreover, working on the tensorized training, FETTA outperforms prior accelerators with a speedup of 3.87~14.63x, and an energy efficiency improvement of 1.41~2.73x on average.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06474'&gt;arXiv:2504.06474&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 08 Apr 2025 22:32:38 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Successive randomized compression: A randomized algorithm for the compressed MPO-MPS product</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06475</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Chris Camaño, Ethan N. Epperly, Joel A. Tropp&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Tensor networks like matrix product states (MPSs) and matrix product operators (MPOs) are powerful tools for representing exponentially large states and operators, with applications in quantum many-body physics, machine learning, numerical analysis, and other areas. In these applications, computing a compressed representation of the MPO--MPS product is a fundamental computational primitive. For this operation, this paper introduces a new single-pass, randomized algorithm, called successive randomized compression (SRC), that improves on existing approaches in speed or in accuracy. The performance of the new algorithm is evaluated on synthetic problems and unitary time evolution problems for quantum spin systems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06475'&gt;arXiv:2504.06475&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 08 Apr 2025 22:33:49 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Identifying Universal Spin Excitations in Spin-1/2 Kagome Quantum Spin Liquid Materials</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06491</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Aaron T. Breidenbach, Arthur C. Campello, Jiajia Wen, Hong-Chen Jiang, Daniel M. Pajerowski, Rebecca W. Smaha, Young S. Lee&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; A quantum spin liquid (QSL) is an exotic quantum state of matter characterized by fluctuating spins which may exhibit long-range entanglement. Among the possible host candidates for a QSL ground state, the $S$=1/2 kagome lattice antiferromagnet is particularly promising. Using high resolution inelastic neutron scattering measurements on Zn-barlowite (Zn$_\mathrm{x}$Cu$_\mathrm{4-x}$(OD)$_\mathrm{6}$FBr, $x\simeq 0.80$), we measure a spin excitation spectrum consistent with a QSL ground state. Continuum scattering above $\sim$1 meV matches that of herbertsmithite (Zn$_\mathrm{x}$Cu$_\mathrm{4-x}$(OD)$_6$Cl$_2$, $x\simeq 0.85$), another prominent kagome QSL material, indicating universal spinon excitations. A detailed analysis of the spin-spin correlations, compared with density matrix renormalization group calculations, further indicate a QSL ground state for the physically relevant Hamiltonian parameters. The measured spectra in Zn-barlowite are consistent with gapped behavior with a gap size $\Delta = 1.1(2)$ meV. Comparison with a simple pair correlation model allows us to clearly distinguish intrinsic kagome correlations from impurity-induced correlations. Our results clarify the behavior that is universal within this important family of QSL candidate materials.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06491'&gt;arXiv:2504.06491&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 08 Apr 2025 23:36:06 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

By leveraging matrix product states to compress the quantum state representation, we simulate an N + 1-spin circular Ising model with a transverse field. Furthermore, we develop an analog error mitigation approach through zero-noise extrapolation by introducing a precise noise injection technique for the transmon qubit. As a validation, we apply our error-mitigated qubit-efficient VQE in determining the ground state energies of a 4-spin Ising model. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of performing quantum algorithms with minimal quantum resources while effectively mitigating the impact of noise, offering a promising pathway to bridge the gap between theoretical advances and practical implementations on current noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06554'&gt;arXiv:2504.06554&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 09 Apr 2025 03:23:26 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Plastic tensor networks for interpretable generative modeling</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06722</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Katsuya O. Akamatsu, Kenji Harada, Tsuyoshi Okubo, Naoki Kawashima&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; A structural optimization scheme for a single-layer nonnegative adaptive tensor tree (NATT) that models a target probability distribution is proposed as an alternative paradigm for generative modeling. The NATT scheme, by construction, automatically searches for a tree structure that best fits a given discrete dataset whose features serve as inputs, and has the advantage that it is interpretable as a probabilistic graphical model. We consider the NATT scheme and a recently proposed Born machine adaptive tensor tree (BMATT) optimization scheme and demonstrate their effectiveness on a variety of generative modeling tasks where the objective is to infer the hidden structure of a provided dataset. Our results show that in terms of minimizing the negative log-likelihood, the single-layer scheme has model performance comparable to the Born machine scheme, though not better. The tasks include deducing the structure of binary bitwise operations, learning the internal structure of random Bayesian networks given only visible sites, and a real-world example related to hierarchical clustering where a cladogram is constructed from mitochondrial DNA sequences. In doing so, we also show the importance of the choice of network topology and the versatility of a least-mutual information criterion in selecting a candidate structure for a tensor tree, as well as discuss aspects of these tensor tree generative models including their information content and interpretability.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06722'&gt;arXiv:2504.06722&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 09 Apr 2025 09:23:11 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Efficient mutual magic and magic capacity with matrix product states</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07230</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Poetri Sonya Tarabunga, Tobias Haug&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Stabilizer R\'enyi entropies (SREs) probe the non-stabilizerness (or magic) of many-body systems and quantum computers. Here, we introduce the mutual von-Neumann SRE and magic capacity, which can be efficiently computed in time $O(N\chi^3)$ for matrix product states (MPSs) of bond dimension $\chi$. We find that mutual SRE characterizes the critical point of ground states of the transverse-field Ising model, independently of the chosen local basis. Then, we relate the magic capacity to the anti-flatness of the Pauli spectrum, which quantifies the complexity of computing SREs. The magic capacity characterizes transitions in the ground state of the Heisenberg and Ising model, randomness of Clifford+T circuits, and distinguishes typical and atypical states. Finally, we make progress on numerical techniques: we design two improved Monte-Carlo algorithms to compute the mutual $2$-SRE, overcoming limitations of previous approaches based on local update. We also give improved statevector simulation methods for Bell sampling and SREs with $O(8^{N/2})$ time and $O(2^N)$ memory, which we demonstrate for $24$ qubits. Our work uncovers improved approaches to study the complexity of quantum many-body systems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07230'&gt;arXiv:2504.07230&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 09 Apr 2025 19:12:26 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Simulating quantum dynamics in two-dimensional lattices with tensor network influence functional belief propagation</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07344</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Gunhee Park, Johnnie Gray, Garnet Kin-Lic Chan&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Describing nonequilibrium quantum dynamics remains a significant computational challenge due to the growth of spatial entanglement. The tensor network influence functional (TN-IF) approach mitigates this problem for computing the time evolution of local observables by encoding the subsystem's influence functional path integral as a matrix product state (MPS), thereby shifting the resource governing computational cost from spatial entanglement to temporal entanglement. We extend the applicability of the TN-IF method to two-dimensional lattices by demonstrating its construction on tree lattices and proposing a belief propagation (BP) algorithm for the TN-IF, termed influence functional BP (IF-BP), to simulate local observable dynamics on arbitrary graphs. Even though the BP algorithm introduces uncontrolled approximation errors on arbitrary graphs, it provides an accurate description for locally tree-like lattices. Numerical simulations of the kicked Ising model on a heavy-hex lattice, motivated by a recent quantum experiment, highlight the effectiveness of the IF-BP method, which demonstrates superior performance in capturing long-time dynamics where traditional tensor network state-based methods struggle. Our results further reveal that the temporal entanglement entropy (TEE) only grows logarithmically with time for this model, resulting in a polynomial computational cost for the whole method. We further construct a cluster expansion of IF-BP to introduce loop correlations beyond the BP approximation, providing a systematic correction to the IF-BP estimate. We demonstrate the power of the cluster expansion of the IF-BP in simulating the quantum quench dynamics of the 2D transverse field Ising model, obtaining numerical results that improve on the state-of-the-art.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07344'&gt;arXiv:2504.07344&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 10 Apr 2025 00:04:32 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Quantifying the Phase Diagram and Hamiltonian of $S=1/2$ Kagome Antiferromagnets: Bridging Theory and Experiment</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07387</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Shengtao Jiang, Arthur C. Campello, Wei He, Jiajia Wen, Daniel M. Pajerowski, Young S. Lee, Hong-Chen Jiang&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Spin-$1/2$ kagome antiferromagnets are leading candidates for realizing quantum spin liquid (QSL) ground states. While QSL ground states are predicted for the pure Heisenberg model, understanding the robustness of the QSL to additional interactions that may be present in real materials is a forefront question in the field. Here we employ large-scale density-matrix renormalization group simulations to investigate the effects of next-nearest neighbor exchange couplings $J_2$ and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions $D$, which are relevant to understanding the prototypical kagome materials herbertsmithite and Zn-barlowite. By utilizing clusters as large as XC12 and extrapolating the results to the thermodynamic limit, we precisely delineate the scope of the QSL phase, which remains robust across an expanded parameter range of $J_2$ and $D$. Direct comparison of the simulated static and dynamic spin structure factors with inelastic neutron scattering reveals the parameter space of the Hamiltonians for herbertsmithite and Zn-barlowite, and, importantly, provides compelling evidence that both materials exist within the QSL phase. These results establish a powerful convergence of theory and experiment in this most elusive state of matter.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07387'&gt;arXiv:2504.07387&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 10 Apr 2025 02:15:03 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

David Lin, Manuel Schneider&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Parton distribution functions (PDFs) describe the inner, non-perturbative structure of hadrons. Their computation involves matrix elements with a Wilson line along a direction on the light cone, posing significant challenges in Euclidean lattice calculations, where the time direction is not directly accessible. We propose implementing the light-front Wilson line within the Hamiltonian formalism using tensor network techniques. The approach is demonstrated in the massive Schwinger model (quantum electrodynamics in 1+1 dimensions), a toy model that shares key features with quantum chromodynamics. We present accurate continuum results for the fermion PDF of the vector meson at varying fermion masses, obtained from first principle calculations directly in Minkowski space. Our strategy also provides a useful path for quantum simulations and quantum computing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07508'&gt;arXiv:2504.07508&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 10 Apr 2025 07:10:53 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Renormalization group-like flows in randomly connected tensor networks</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Naoki Sasakura&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Randomly connected tensor networks (RCTN) are the dynamical systems defined by summing over all the possible networks of tensors. Because of the absence of fixed lattice structure, RCTN is not expected to have renormalization procedures. In this paper, however, we consider RCTN with a real tensor, and it is proven that a Hamiltonian vector flow of a tensor model in the canonical formalism with a positive cosmological constant has the properties which a renormalization group (RG) flow of RCTN would have: The flow has fixed points on phase transition surfaces; every flow line is asymptotically terminated by fixed points at both ends, where an upstream fixed point has higher criticality than a downstream one; the flow goes along phase transition surfaces; there exists a function which monotonically decreases along the flow, analogously to the $a$- and $c$-functions of RG. A complete classification of fixed points is given. Although there are no cyclic flows in the strict sense, these exist, if infinitesimal jumps are allowed near fixed points.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07587'&gt;arXiv:2504.07587&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 10 Apr 2025 09:30:04 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Fractional Chern Insulator and Quantum Anomalous Hall Crystal in Twisted MoTe$_2$</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Jialin Chen, Qiaoyi Li, Xiaoyu Wang, Wei Li&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Recent experimental advances have uncovered fractional Chern insulators in twisted MoTe$_2$ (tMoTe$_2$) systems, posing significant theoretical challenges in understanding the interaction effects and correlated topological phases. Here, we construct a realistic moir\'e lattice model tailored for tMoTe$_2$ and conduct investigations using state-of-the-art tensor-network methods. Our ground-state calculations reveal a rich array of interaction- and filling-dependent phases, including the FCI, Chern insulator, and generalized Wigner crystal, etc., explaining recent experimental observations. Moreover, we reveal quantum anomalous Hall crystals exhibiting integer Hall conductivity at fractional moir\'e unit cell fillings, which opens new avenues for experimental exploration in tMoTe$_2$. In the FCI phase, dynamical simulations reveal a single-particle continuum with a finite charge gap, indicating the presence of fractional charge excitations. Moreover, our finite-temperature calculations determine the characteristic temperatures for charge activation and ferromagnetic (FM) transitions, consistent with experiments. We find that the charge gap is significantly larger than the energy scales of both thermal activation and FM transitions, explaining recent experimental observations. Overall, by integrating ground-state, finite-temperature, and dynamical tensor-network calculations on the real-space model, we establish a theoretical framework for understanding and exploring correlated topological phases in tMoTe$_2$ and related systems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07932'&gt;arXiv:2504.07932&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 10 Apr 2025 17:47:23 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

In this work, we investigate the entanglement entropy of \textit{quantum} chiral magnets and demonstrate that it reflects the inhomogeneous nature of the ground state. We perform numerical simulations of a one-dimensional monoaxial chiral ferromagnetic chain with Zeeman term using the density matrix renormalization group method. Our results show that the entanglement entropy exhibits oscillatory behavior, which can be tuned by varying the external magnetic field. Analysis of the local magnetization and spin chirality further confirms that these oscillations correspond to solitonic structures. Moreover, our findings suggest that the entanglement entropy can serve as a probe for detecting the vacuum structure, providing new insights into quantum correlations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08273'&gt;arXiv:2504.08273&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 11 Apr 2025 06:11:12 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

In addition to the expected renormalization to the band structure, we find that the electron-phonon (e-ph) interaction produces an anomalous spectral feature when electrons are added in the singlet channel but which is absent in the triplet channel. By comparing these results with those obtained from perturbation theory in the antiadiabatic limit, we demonstrate that this anomalous feature is a remnant of the strong electron-electron interaction mediated by the SSH coupling previously derived in the two-particle limit. By studying the evolution of this feature as a function of doping, we track the fate of this attraction to higher carrier concentrations and provide predictions for the spectral features to help guide future searches for strong e-ph mediated pairing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09020'&gt;arXiv:2504.09020&lt;/a&gt;] Published Sat, 12 Apr 2025 00:15:19 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>SW-TNC : Reaching the Most Complex Random Quantum Circuit via Tensor Network Contraction</title>

With the increasing complexity and diversity of quantum circuit structures, existing classical simulation algorithms need to be improved and extended. In this work, we propose novel strategies for tensor network contraction based simulator on Sunway architecture. Our approach addresses three main aspects: complexity, computational paradigms and fine-grained optimization. Data reuse schemes are designed to reduce floating-point operations, and memory organization techniques are employed to eliminate slicing overhead while maintaining parallelism. Step fusion strategy is extended by multi-core cooperation to improve the data locality and computation intensity. Fine-grained optimizations, such as in-kernel vectorized permutations, and split-K operators, are developed as well to address the challenges in new hotspot distribution and topological structure. These innovations can accelerate the simulation of the Zuchongzhi-60-24 by more than 10 times, using more than 1024 Sunway nodes (399,360 cores). Our work demonstrates the potential for enabling efficient classical simulation of increasingly complex quantum circuits.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09186'&gt;arXiv:2504.09186&lt;/a&gt;] Published Sat, 12 Apr 2025 12:00:48 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Adiabatic Encoding of Pre-trained MPS Classifiers into Quantum Circuits</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Keisuke Murota&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Although Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs) offer powerful methods for classification tasks, the training of QNNs faces two major training obstacles: barren plateaus and local minima. A promising solution is to first train a tensor-network (TN) model classically and then embed it into a QNN.\ However, embedding TN-classifiers into quantum circuits generally requires postselection whose success probability may decay exponentially with the system size. We propose an \emph{adiabatic encoding} framework that encodes pre-trained MPS-classifiers into quantum MPS (qMPS) circuits with postselection, and gradually removes the postselection while retaining performance. We prove that training qMPS-classifiers from scratch on a certain artificial dataset is exponentially hard due to barren plateaus, but our adiabatic encoding circumvents this issue. Additional numerical experiments on binary MNIST also confirm its robustness.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09250'&gt;arXiv:2504.09250&lt;/a&gt;] Published Sat, 12 Apr 2025 15:12:46 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>An Exact Link between Nonlocal Magic and Operator Entanglement</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09360</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Faidon Andreadakis, Paolo Zanardi&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Nonstabilizerness, commonly referred to as magic, is a quantum property of states associated with the non-Clifford resources required for their preparation. As a resource, magic complements entanglement, and the interplay between these two concepts has garnered significant attention in recent years. In this work, we establish an exact correspondence between the generation of nonlocal magic and operator entanglement under unitary evolutions. Nonlocal magic refers to nonstabilizerness that cannot be erased via local operations, while operator entanglement generalizes entanglement to operator space, characterizing the complexity of operators across a bipartition. Specifically, we prove that a unitary map generates nonlocal magic if and only if it generates operator entanglement on Pauli strings. Guided by this result, we introduce an average measure of a unitary's Pauli-entangling power, serving as a proxy for nonlocal magic generation. We derive analytical formulas for this measure and examine its properties, including its typical value and upper bounds in terms of the nonstabilizerness properties of the evolution.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09360'&gt;arXiv:2504.09360&lt;/a&gt;] Published Sat, 12 Apr 2025 22:40:04 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Cross-talk in superconducting qubit lattices with tunable couplers - comparing transmon and fluxonium architectures</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10298</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; F. Lange, L. Heunisch, H. Fehske, D. P. DiVincenzo, M. J. Hartmann&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Cross-talk between qubits is one of the main challenges for scaling superconducting quantum processors. Here, we use the density-matrix renormalization-group to numerically analyze lattices of superconducting qubits from a perspective of many-body localization. Specifically, we compare different architectures that include tunable couplers designed to decouple qubits in the idle state, and calculate the residual ZZ interactions as well as the inverse participation ratio in the computational basis states. For transmon qubits outside of the straddling regime, the results confirm that tunable C-shunt flux couplers are significantly more efficient in mitigating the ZZ interactions than tunable transmons. A recently proposed fluxonium architecture with tunable transmon couplers is demonstrated to also maintain its strong suppression of the ZZ interactions in larger systems, while having a higher inverse participation ratio in the computational basis states than lattices of transmon qubits. Our results thus suggest that fluxonium architectures may feature lower cross talk than transmon lattices when designed to achieve similar gate speeds and fidelities.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10298'&gt;arXiv:2504.10298&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 14 Apr 2025 15:07:35 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Universal fault-tolerant logic with heterogeneous holographic codes</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10386</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Matthew Steinberg, Junyu Fan, Jens Eisert, Sebastian Feld, Alexander Jahn, Chunjun Cao&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The study of holographic bulk-boundary dualities has led to the construction of novel quantum error correcting codes. Although these codes have shed new light on conceptual aspects of these dualities, they have widely been believed to lack a crucial feature of practical quantum error correction: The ability to support universal fault-tolerant quantum logic. In this work, we introduce a new class of holographic codes that realize this feature. These heterogeneous holographic codes are constructed by combining two seed codes in a tensor network on an alternating hyperbolic tiling. We show how this construction generalizes previous strategies for fault tolerance in tree-type concatenated codes, allowing one to implement non-Clifford gates fault-tolerantly on the holographic boundary. We also demonstrate that these codes allow for high erasure thresholds under a suitable heterogeneous combination of specific seed codes. Compared to previous concatenated codes, heterogeneous holographic codes achieve large overhead savings in physical qubits, e.g., a $21.8\%$ reduction for a two-layer Steane/quantum Reed-Muller combination. Unlike standard concatenated codes, we establish that the new codes can encode more than a single logical qubit per code block by applying ``black hole'' deformations with tunable rate and distance, while possessing fully addressable, universal fault-tolerant gate sets. Therefore, our work strengthens the case for the utility of holographic quantum codes for practical quantum computing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10386'&gt;arXiv:2504.10386&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 14 Apr 2025 16:28:33 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Permutation of Tensor-Train Cores for Computing Moments on Stochastic Differential Equations</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10492</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Kayo Kinjo, Rihito Sakurai, Tatsuya Kishimoto, Jun Ohkubo&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Tensor networks, particularly the tensor train (TT) format, have emerged as powerful tools for high-dimensional computations in physics and computer science. In solving coupled differential equations, such as those arising from stochastic differential equations (SDEs) via duality relations, ordering the TT cores significantly influences numerical accuracy. In this study, we first systematically investigate how different orderings of the TT cores affect the accuracy of computed moments using the duality relation in stochastic processes. Through numerical experiments on a two-body interaction model, we demonstrate that specific orderings of the TT cores yield lower relative errors, particularly when they align with the underlying interaction structure of the system. Motivated by these findings, we then propose a novel quantitative measure, $score$, which is defined based on an ordering of the TT cores and an SDE parameter set. While the score is independent of the accuracy of moments to compute by definition, we assess its effectiveness by evaluating the accuracy of computed moments. Our results indicate that orderings that minimize the score tend to yield higher accuracy. This study provides insights into optimizing orderings of the TT cores, which is essential for efficient and reliable high-dimensional simulations of stochastic processes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10492'&gt;arXiv:2504.10492&lt;/a&gt;] Published Sat, 29 Mar 2025 03:44:45 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Heat operator approach to quantum stochastic thermodynamics in the strong-coupling regime</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10631</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Sheikh Parvez Mandal, Mahasweta Pandit, Khalak Mahadeviya, Mark T. Mitchison, Javier Prior&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Open quantum systems exchange heat with their environments and the fluctuations of this heat carry crucial signatures of the underlying dynamical processes. Within the well-established two-point measurement scheme and employing thermofield dynamics, we identify a 'heat operator,' whose moments with respect to the vacuum state correspond to the stochastic moments of the heat exchanged with a thermal bath. This recasts the computation of heat statistics as a standard unitary time-evolution problem, allowing us to leverage powerful tensor-network techniques for simulating quantum dynamics. In particular, we exploit the chain mapping of thermodynamic reservoirs to compute heat fluctuations in the Ohmic spin-boson model. The method, however, is general and applies to arbitrary open quantum systems coupled to non-interacting (bosonic or fermionic) thermal environments, offering a powerful, non-perturbative framework for understanding heat transfer in open quantum systems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10631'&gt;arXiv:2504.10631&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 14 Apr 2025 18:26:45 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Algorithmic Advances Towards a Realizable Quantum Lattice Boltzmann Method</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10870</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Apurva Tiwari, Jason Iaconis, Jezer Jojo, Sayonee Ray, Martin Roetteler, Chris Hill, Jay Pathak&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The Quantum Lattice Boltzmann Method (QLBM) is one of the most promising approaches for realizing the potential of quantum computing in simulating computational fluid dynamics. Many recent works mostly focus on classical simulation, and rely on full state tomography. Several key algorithmic issues like observable readout, data encoding, and impractical circuit depth remain unsolved. As a result, these are not directly realizable on any quantum hardware. We present a series of novel algorithmic advances which allow us to implement the QLBM algorithm, for the first time, on a quantum computer. Hardware results for the time evolution of a 2D Gaussian initial density distribution subject to a uniform advection-diffusion field are presented. Furthermore, 3D simulation results are presented for particular non-uniform advection fields, devised so as to avoid the problem of diminishing probability of success due to repeated post-selection operations required for multiple timesteps. We demonstrate the evolution of an initial quantum state governed by the advection-diffusion equation, accounting for the iterative nature of the explicit QLBM algorithm. A tensor network encoding scheme is used to represent the initial condition supplied to the advection-diffusion equation, significantly reducing the two-qubit gate count affording a shorter circuit depth. Further reductions are made in the collision and streaming operators. Collectively, these advances give a path to realizing more practical, 2D and 3D QLBM applications with non-trivial velocity fields on quantum hardware.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10870'&gt;arXiv:2504.10870&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 15 Apr 2025 05:02:41 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Symmetry-protected topological order identified via Gutzwiller-guided density-matrix-renormalization-group: $\mathrm{SO}(n)$ spin chains</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10919</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Pei-Yuan Cai, Hui-Ke Jin, Yi Zhou&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We present a comprehensive study of topological phases in the SO($n$) spin chains using a combination of analytical parton construction and numerical techniques. For even $n=2l$, we identify a novel SPT$^2$ phase characterized by two distinct topological sectors, exhibiting exact degeneracy at the matrix product state (MPS) exactly solvable point. Through Gutzwiller-projected mean-field theory and density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) calculations, we demonstrate that these sectors remain topologically degenerate in close chains throughout the SPT$^2$ phase, with energy gaps decaying exponentially with system size. For odd $n=2l+1$, we show that the ground state remains unique in close chains. We precisely characterize critical states using entanglement entropy scaling, confirming the central charges predicted by conformal field theories. Our results reveal fundamental differences between even and odd $n$ cases, provide numerical verification of topological protection, and establish reliable methods for studying high-symmetry quantum systems. The Gutzwiller-guided DMRG is demonstrated to be notably efficient in targeting specific topological sectors.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10919'&gt;arXiv:2504.10919&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 15 Apr 2025 06:59:18 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Non-stabilizerness in open XXZ spin chains: Universal scaling and dynamics</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11139</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Doru Sticlet, Balázs Dóra, Dominik Szombathy, Gergely Zaránd, Cătălin Paşcu Moca&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Magic, or non-stabilizerness, is a crucial quantum resource, yet its dynamics in open quantum systems remain largely unexplored. We investigate magic in the open XXZ spin chain under either boundary gain and loss, or bulk dephasing using the stabilizer R\'enyi entropy $M_2$. To enable scalable simulations of large systems, we develop a novel, highly efficient algorithm for computing $M_2$ within the matrix product states formalism while maintaining constant bond dimension--an advancement over existing methods. For boundary driving, we uncover universal scaling laws, $M_2(t) \sim t^{1/z}$, linked to the dynamical exponent $z$ for several distinct universality classes. We also disentangle classical and quantum contributions to magic by introducing a mean-field approximation for magic, thus emphasizing the prominent role of quantum critical fluctuations in non-stabilizerness. For bulk dephasing, dissipation can transiently enhance magic before suppressing it, and drive it to a nontrivial steady-state value. These findings position magic as a powerful diagnostic tool for probing universality and dynamics in open quantum systems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11139'&gt;arXiv:2504.11139&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 15 Apr 2025 12:41:52 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>A Quantum-Inspired Algorithm for Wave Simulation Using Tensor Networks</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11181</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Kevin Lively, Vittorio Pagni, Gonzalo Camacho&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We present an efficient classical algorithm based on the construction of a unitary quantum circuit for simulating the Isotropic Wave Equation (IWE) in one, two, or three dimensions. Using an analogy with the massless Dirac equation, second order time and space derivatives in the IWE are reduced to first order, resulting in a Schr\"odinger equation of motion. Exact diagonalization of the unitary circuit in combination with Tensor Networks allows simulation of the wave equation with a resolution of $10^{13}$ grid points on a laptop. A method for encoding arbitrary analytical functions into diagonal Matrix Product Operators is employed to prepare and evolve a Matrix Product State (MPS) encoding the solution. Since the method relies on the Quantum Fourier Transform, which has been shown to generate small entanglement when applied to arbitrary MPSs, simulating the evolution of initial conditions with sufficiently low bond dimensions to high accuracy becomes highly efficient, up to the cost of Trotterized propagation and sampling of the wavefunction. We conclude by discussing possible extensions of the approach for carrying out Tensor Network simulations of other partial differential equations such as Maxwell's equations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11181'&gt;arXiv:2504.11181&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 15 Apr 2025 13:36:08 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Assessing Tensor Network Quantum Emulators for Hamiltonian Simulation of Pharmaceutical Molecules: Challenges and Limitations in Drug Discovery Applications</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Marek Kowalik, Ellen Michael, Peter Pogány, Phalgun Lolur&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Quantum computing holds promise for revolutionizing computational chemistry simulations, particularly in drug discovery. However, current quantum hardware is limited by noise and scale, necessitating bridging technologies. This study provides an initial evaluation of tensor network quantum emulators, narrowed to matrix product state-based emulators, for Hamiltonian simulation of pharmaceutical molecules, with a focus on predicting the reactivity of targeted covalent drugs. We assess runtime scaling, accuracy, and resource requirements across various active space sizes, comparing performance to traditional state vector simulation methods. Our results reveal that, for accurate estimation of the expectation value trajectory of a key measurement operator - used as a quantum-derived feature for reactivity prediction - the required bond dimension in matrix product state tensor networks grows rapidly with system size, effectively negating runtime advantages for larger, chemically relevant molecules. This study highlights the fundamental challenges in classically simulating complex quantum chemistry systems and contributes to the support of the irreplaceability premise of quantum computers to efficiently handle strongly entangled systems. Such robustness of fault-tolerant quantum computers leads to practical advantages in drug discovery applications.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11399'&gt;arXiv:2504.11399&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 15 Apr 2025 17:14:01 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Property Inheritance for Subtensors in Tensor Train Decompositions</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; HanQin Cai, Longxiu Huang&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Tensor dimensionality reduction is one of the fundamental tools for modern data science. To address the high computational overhead, fiber-wise sampled subtensors that preserve the original tensor rank are often used in designing efficient and scalable tensor dimensionality reduction. However, the theory of property inheritance for subtensors is still underdevelopment, that is, how the essential properties of the original tensor will be passed to its subtensors. This paper theoretically studies the property inheritance of the two key tensor properties, namely incoherence and condition number, under the tensor train setting. We also show how tensor train rank is preserved through fiber-wise sampling. The key parameters introduced in theorems are numerically evaluated under various settings. The results show that the properties of interest can be well preserved to the subtensors formed via fiber-wise sampling. Overall, this paper provides several handy analytic tools for developing efficient tensor analysis methods.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11396'&gt;arXiv:2504.11396&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 15 Apr 2025 17:10:38 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Integrating Neural Networks and Tensor Networks for Computing Free Energy</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12037</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Hanyan Cao, Yijia Wang, Feng Pan, Pan Zhang&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Computing free energy is a fundamental problem in statistical physics. Recently, two distinct methods have been developed and have demonstrated remarkable success: the tensor-network-based contraction method and the neural-network-based variational method. Tensor networks are accu?rate, but their application is often limited to low-dimensional systems due to the high computational complexity in high-dimensional systems. The neural network method applies to systems with general topology. However, as a variational method, it is not as accurate as tensor networks. In this work, we propose an integrated approach, tensor-network-based variational autoregressive networks (TNVAN), that leverages the strengths of both tensor networks and neural networks: combining the variational autoregressive neural network's ability to compute an upper bound on free energy and perform unbiased sampling from the variational distribution with the tensor network's power to accurately compute the partition function for small sub-systems, resulting in a robust method for precisely estimating free energy. To evaluate the proposed approach, we conducted numerical experiments on spin glass systems with various topologies, including two-dimensional lattices, fully connected graphs, and random graphs. Our numerical results demonstrate the superior accuracy of our method compared to existing approaches. In particular, it effectively handles systems with long-range interactions and leverages GPU efficiency without requiring singular value decomposition, indicating great potential in tackling statistical mechanics problems and simulating high-dimensional complex systems through both tensor networks and neural networks.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12037'&gt;arXiv:2504.12037&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 16 Apr 2025 12:52:19 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>A Strong-Coupling-Limit Study on the Pairing Mechanism in the Pressurized La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12127</link>

To investigate the underlying pairing mechanism and symmetry in this complex system, we propose and analyze a mixed spin-$1$ and spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ bilayer $t$-$J$ model in the strong coupling regime. This model explicitly incorporates the crucial role of strong Hund's coupling, which favors the formation of local spin-triplet states from the two onsite $E_g$ orbital electrons at half-filling. We further investigate the model using both slave-particle mean-field theory and the density matrix renormalization group method. Our simulation results reveal that the dominate pairing channel is the interlayer one in the $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital. The Hund's coupling is shown to enhance superconductivity within a reasonable physical range. Moreover, electron doping strengthens superconductivity by increasing carrier density; in contrast, hole doping weakens superconductivity. These findings offer critical insights into the unconventional superconductivity of pressurized La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and underline the important role of orbital-selective behavior and Hund's rule.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12127'&gt;arXiv:2504.12127&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 16 Apr 2025 14:42:22 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>ScarFinder: a detector of optimal scar trajectories in quantum many-body dynamics</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Jie Ren, Andrew Hallam, Lei Ying, Zlatko Papić&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Mechanisms that give rise to coherent quantum dynamics, such as quantum many-body scars, have recently attracted much interest as a way of controlling quantum chaos. However, identifying the presence of quantum scars in general many-body Hamiltonians remains an outstanding challenge. Here we introduce ScarFinder, a variational framework that reveals possible scar-like dynamics without prior knowledge of scar states or their algebraic structure. By iteratively evolving and projecting states within a low-entanglement variational manifold, ScarFinder isolates scarred trajectories by suppressing thermal contributions. We validate the method on the analytically tractable spin-1 XY model, recovering the known scar dynamics, as well as the mixed field Ising model, where we capture and generalize the initial conditions previously associated with ``weak thermalization''. We then apply the method to the PXP model of Rydberg atom arrays, efficiently characterizing its mixed phase space and finding a previously unknown trajectory with nearly-perfect revival dynamics in the thermodynamic limit. Our results establish ScarFinder as a powerful, model-agnostic tool for identifying and optimizing coherent dynamics in quantum many-body systems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12383'&gt;arXiv:2504.12383&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 16 Apr 2025 18:00:01 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Learning transitions in classical Ising models and deformed toric codes</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12385</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Malte Pütz, Samuel J. Garratt, Hidetoshi Nishimori, Simon Trebst, Guo-Yi Zhu&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Conditional probability distributions describe the effect of learning an initially unknown classical state through Bayesian inference. Here we demonstrate the existence of a learning transition, having signatures in the long distance behavior of conditional correlation functions, in the two-dimensional classical Ising model. This transition, which arises when learning local energy densities, extends all the way from the infinite-temperature paramagnetic state down to the thermal critical state. The intersection of the line of learning transitions and the thermal Ising transition is a novel tricritical point. Our model for learning also describes the effects of weak measurements on a family of quantum states which interpolate between the (topologically ordered) toric code and a trivial product state. Notably, the location of the above tricritical point implies that the quantum memory in the entire topological phase is robust to weak measurement, even when the initial state is arbitrarily close to the quantum phase transition separating topological and trivial phases. Our analysis uses a replica field theory combined with the renormalization group, and we chart out the phase diagram using a combination of tensor network and Monte Carlo techniques. Our methods can be extended to study the more general effects of learning on both classical and quantum states.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12385'&gt;arXiv:2504.12385&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 16 Apr 2025 18:00:01 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>A tensor network approach to sensing quantum light-matter interactions</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Aiman Khan, Francesco Albarelli, Animesh Datta&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We present the fundamental limits to the precision of estimating parameters of a quantum matter system probed by light, even when some of the light is lost. This practically inevitable scenario leads to a tripartite quantum system of matter, and light -- detected and lost. Evaluating fundamental information theoretic quantities such as the quantum Fisher information of only the detected light was heretofore impossible. We succeed by expressing the final quantum state of the detected light as a matrix product operator. We apply our method to resonance fluorescence and pulsed spectroscopy. For both, we quantify the sub-optimality of continuous homodyning and photo-counting measurements in parameter estimation. For the latter, we find that single-photon Fock state pulses allow higher precision per photon than pulses of coherent states. Our method should be valuable in studies of quantum light-matter interactions, quantum light spectroscopy, quantum stochastic thermodynamics, and quantum clocks.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12399'&gt;arXiv:2504.12399&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 16 Apr 2025 18:06:10 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Finding periodic orbits in projected quantum many-body dynamics</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12472</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Elena Petrova, Marko Ljubotina, Gökhan Yalnız, Maksym Serbyn&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Describing general quantum many-body dynamics is a challenging task due to the exponential growth of the Hilbert space with system size. The time-dependent variational principle (TDVP) provides a powerful tool to tackle this task by projecting quantum evolution onto a classical dynamical system within a variational manifold. In classical systems, periodic orbits play a crucial role in understanding the structure of the phase space and the long-term behavior of the system. However, finding periodic orbits is generally difficult, and their existence and properties in generic TDVP dynamics over matrix product states have remained largely unexplored. In this work, we develop an algorithm to systematically identify and characterize periodic orbits in TDVP dynamics. Applying our method to the periodically kicked Ising model, we uncover both stable and unstable periodic orbits. We characterize the Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser tori in the vicinity of stable periodic orbits and track the change of the periodic orbits as we modify the Hamiltonian parameters. We observe that periodic orbits exist at any value of the coupling constant between prethermal and fully thermalizing regimes, but their relevance to quantum dynamics and imprint on quantum eigenstates diminishes as the system leaves the prethermal regime. Our results demonstrate that periodic orbits provide valuable insights into the TDVP approximation of quantum many-body evolution and establish a closer connection between quantum and classical chaos.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12472'&gt;arXiv:2504.12472&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 16 Apr 2025 20:20:22 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Realizing string breaking dynamics in a $Z_2$ lattice gauge theory on quantum hardware</title>

Using Tensor Network simulations, we demonstrate that the static potential as well as the site-resolved configuration of the matter sites and gauge links allows us to identify the regimes in which string breaking occurs. Furthermore, we develop a variational quantum eigensolver that allows for reliably preparing the ground state of the theory in both the absence and presence of static charges and to capture the static aspects of the phenomenon. Carrying out state preparation on real quantum hardware for up to 19 qubits, we demonstrate its suitability for current quantum devices. In addition, we study the real-time dynamics of a flux tube between two static charges using both Tensor Networks and quantum hardware. Using a trotterization for the time-evolution operator, we are able to show that the breaking process starts with the creation of charges inside the string. These eventually redistribute towards the static charges and screen them, which leads to the breaking of the flux tube.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13760'&gt;arXiv:2504.13760&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 18 Apr 2025 15:52:31 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

For an open system with Hilbert space dimension $D$, the quantum state of the emitted radiation can be described as a temporally ordered matrix-product state (MPS). We provide simple analytical expressions for the quantum Fisher information (QFI) of the radiation state, which asymptotically scales linearly with the sensing time unless the open system has multiple steady states. We characterize the crossovers in QFI near dynamical phase transitions, emphasizing the role of temporal correlations in setting the asymptotic rate at which QFI increases. We discuss when optimal sensing is possible with instantaneously measured radiation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13815'&gt;arXiv:2504.13815&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 18 Apr 2025 17:43:31 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Comparative Benchmarking of Utility-Scale Quantum Emulators</title>

In this study, we benchmark seven state-of-the-art quantum emulators employing techniques such as tensor networks, matrix product states (MPS), decision diagrams, and factorized ket based methods, running on CPU based hardware and focusing on effectively exact simulations. Performance is assessed on 13 benchmark circuits from the MQTBench library, spanning circuit sizes from 4 to 1,024 qubits. Our results reveal that MPS-based emulators outperform other approaches overall, successfully solving 8 benchmarks up to the maximum size of 1,024 qubits and 12 benchmarks up to at least 100 qubits in less than 5 minutes. We find evidence that all circuits except a random one can be simulated in polynomial time. This work demonstrates that quantum emulators can faithfully simulate a broad range of large and complex universal quantum circuits with high fidelity, far beyond the limits of statevector simulators and today's quantum hardware.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14027'&gt;arXiv:2504.14027&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 18 Apr 2025 18:32:47 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Gauging Quantum Phases: A Matrix Product State Approach</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; David Blanik, José Garre-Rubio, Norbert Schuch&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Utilizing the framework of matrix product states, we investigate gauging as a method for exploring quantum phases of matter. Specifically, we describe how symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases and spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) phases in one-dimensional spin systems behave under twisted gauging, a generalization of the well-known gauging procedure for globally symmetric states. Compared to previous, order parameter--based, approaches our analysis is not limited to the case of maximally non-commutative (MNC) phases and we use our findings to propose a generalization of the Kennedy-Tasaki transformation to the non-MNC setting. A key result of our work is that gauging produces configurations characterized by a combination of MNC order and symmetry breaking, when applied to non-MNC SPT phases. More generally, we conjecture a precise correspondence between SSB and non-MNC SPT phases, possibly enabling the detection of such phases using local and string order parameters.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14380'&gt;arXiv:2504.14380&lt;/a&gt;] Published Sat, 19 Apr 2025 19:04:26 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>A Review on the Applications of Density Functional Theory to the FQH System</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Yi Yang, Yayun Hu, Zi-Xiang Hu&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The fractional quantum Hall (FQH) effect remains a captivating area in condensed matter physics, characterized by strongly correlated topological order, fractionalized excitations, and anyonic statistics. Numerical simulations, such as exact diagonalization, density matrix renormalization group, matrix product states, and Monte Carlo methods, are essential to examine the properties of strongly correlated systems. Recently, density functional theory (DFT) has been employed in this field within the framework of composite fermion (CF) theory. In this paper, we assess how DFT addresses major challenges in FQH system, such as computing ground state and low-energy excitations. We emphasize the critical insights provided by DFT-based methods into the CF model, edge effects, and the nature of fractional charge and magnetoroton excitations. Furthermore, we examine the advantages and limitations of DFT approaches, highlight the interplay between numerical simulations and theoretical models. We finally discuss the future potential of time-dependent DFT (TDDFT) for modeling non-equilibrium dynamics.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14558'&gt;arXiv:2504.14558&lt;/a&gt;] Published Sun, 20 Apr 2025 10:08:02 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Page curve like dynamics in Interacting Quantum Systems</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14675</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Tamoghna Ray, Abhishek Dhar, Manas Kulkarni&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We study the dynamics of entanglement in a one-dimensional $XXZ$ spin-$1/2$ chain, with and without integrability-breaking interactions, that is connected to a bath. We start from a state where the system and bath are completely unentangled, and the bath is polarized spin-down. We consider two different initial states for the system - (i) a polarized spin-up state, and (ii) an infinite temperature state. In the particle representation of the spin chain, the polarized spin-up state corresponds to a filled state, while the polarized spin-down state corresponds to an empty state. Starting from these inhomogeneous quenches, in all the above-mentioned cases we obtain the Page curve like behavior in the entanglement. We report different power-law behavior in the growth of entanglement for different initial states and different kinds of baths (interacting and non-interacting). In an attempt to explore plausible deep connections between entanglement and Boltzmann entropy, we investigate the latter in both the filled and the infinite temperature case, for the system and the bath. For the filled case, the Boltzmann entropy of the system has the form of a Page curve but quantitatively deviates from the entanglement. On the other hand, the entropy of the bath keeps increasing. Remarkably, for the infinite temperature case, we find that the system and bath Boltzmann entropies agree with the entanglement entropy, after and before the Page time, respectively. Our findings are expected to hold for generic interacting quantum systems and could be of relevance to black hole physics.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14675'&gt;arXiv:2504.14675&lt;/a&gt;] Published Sun, 20 Apr 2025 16:36:38 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Trainable Quantum Neural Network for Multiclass Image Classification with the Power of Pre-trained Tree Tensor Networks</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14995</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Keisuke Murota, Takumi Kobori&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Tree tensor networks (TTNs) offer powerful models for image classification. While these TTN image classifiers already show excellent performance on classical hardware, embedding them into quantum neural networks (QNNs) may further improve the performance by leveraging quantum resources. However, embedding TTN classifiers into QNNs for multiclass classification remains challenging. Key obstacles are the highorder gate operations required for large bond dimensions and the mid-circuit postselection with exponentially low success rates necessary for the exact embedding. In this work, to address these challenges, we propose forest tensor network (FTN)-classifiers, which aggregate multiple small-bond-dimension TTNs. This allows us to handle multiclass classification without requiring large gates in the embedded circuits. We then remove the overhead of mid-circuit postselection by extending the adiabatic encoding framework to our setting and smoothly encode the FTN-classifiers into a quantum forest tensor network (qFTN)- classifiers. Numerical experiments on MNIST and CIFAR-10 demonstrate that we can successfully train FTN-classifiers and encode them into qFTN-classifiers, while maintaining or even improving the performance of the pre-trained FTN-classifiers. These results suggest that synergy between TTN classification models and QNNs can provide a robust and scalable framework for multiclass quantum-enhanced image classification.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14995'&gt;arXiv:2504.14995&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 21 Apr 2025 09:51:39 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Note on Type $III_1$ Algebras in $ c= 1$ String Theory and Bulk Causal Diamonds</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15076</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; T. Banks&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We argue that the Leutheusser-Liu procedure of isolating a von Neumann algebra in the $N = \infty$ limit of string theories, leads to the algebra of relativistic fermion fields on a half line for the $c = 1$ string theory. This is a Type $I$ von Neumann algebra, since it is the algebra of the Rindler wedge in the Rindler vacuum state. Subalgebras of finite regions are Type $III_1$. The argument uses the elegant results of Moore and of Alexandrov, Kazakov and Kostov. This model is well known to be integrable and have no black hole excitations. We have speculated that adding an interaction invisible in perturbation theory to a large finite number, $M$, of copies of the model, produces a non-integrable model with meta-stable excitations having all of the properties of linear dilaton black holes. The algebra of fields is the tensor product of $M$ copies of the $c = 1$ model's algebra, whether or not we add the non-integrable interaction. We argue that the infinite dimensional $c = 1$ algebras are analogous to those of the boundary field theory in AdS/CFT, even though they appear to encode bulk causal structure. An IR cutoff on the boundary renders them finite and causal structure must be formulated in terms of an analog of the Tensor Network Renormalization Group. This is a time dependent Hamiltonian flow, embedding smaller Hilbert spaces into larger ones. It is the analog of one sided modular inclusion in quantum field theory.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15076'&gt;arXiv:2504.15076&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 21 Apr 2025 13:04:09 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Simulating quantum dynamics in two-dimensional lattices with tensor network influence functional belief propagation</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07344</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Gunhee Park, Johnnie Gray, Garnet Kin-Lic Chan&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Describing nonequilibrium quantum dynamics remains a significant computational challenge due to the growth of spatial entanglement. The tensor network influence functional (TN-IF) approach mitigates this problem for computing the time evolution of local observables by encoding the subsystem's influence functional path integral as a matrix product state (MPS), thereby shifting the resource governing computational cost from spatial entanglement to temporal entanglement. We extend the applicability of the TN-IF method to two-dimensional lattices by demonstrating its construction on tree lattices and proposing a belief propagation (BP) algorithm for the TN-IF, termed influence functional BP (IF-BP), to simulate local observable dynamics on arbitrary graphs. Even though the BP algorithm introduces uncontrolled approximation errors on arbitrary graphs, it provides an accurate description for locally tree-like lattices. Numerical simulations of the kicked Ising model on a heavy-hex lattice, motivated by a recent quantum experiment, highlight the effectiveness of the IF-BP method, which demonstrates superior performance in capturing long-time dynamics where traditional tensor network state-based methods struggle. Our results further reveal that the temporal entanglement entropy (TEE) only grows logarithmically with time for this model, resulting in a polynomial computational cost for the whole method. We further construct a cluster expansion of IF-BP to introduce loop correlations beyond the BP approximation, providing a systematic correction to the IF-BP estimate. We demonstrate the power of the cluster expansion of the IF-BP in simulating the quantum quench dynamics of the 2D transverse field Ising model, obtaining numerical results that improve on the state-of-the-art.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07344'&gt;arXiv:2504.07344&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 10 Apr 2025 00:04:32 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Branch-and-bound digitized counterdiabatic quantum optimization</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Anton Simen, Sebastián V. Romero, Alejandro Gomez Cadavid, Enrique Solano, Narendra N. Hegade&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Branch-and-bound algorithms effectively solve combinatorial optimization problems, relying on the relaxation of the objective function to obtain tight lower bounds. While this is straightforward for convex objective functions, higher-order formulations pose challenges due to their inherent non-convexity. In this work, we propose branch-and-bound digitized counterdiabatic quantum optimization (BB-DCQO), a quantum algorithm that addresses the relaxation difficulties in higher-order unconstrained binary optimization (HUBO) problems. By employing bias fields as approximate solutions to the relaxed problem, we iteratively enhance the quality of the results compared to the bare bias-field digitized counterdiabatic quantum optimization (BF-DCQO) algorithm. We refer to this enhanced method as BBB-DCQO. In order to benchmark it against simulated annealing (SA), we apply it on sparse HUBO instances with up to $156$ qubits using tensor network simulations. To explore regimes that are less tractable for classical simulations, we experimentally apply BBB-DCQO to denser problems using up to 100 qubits on IBM quantum hardware. We compare our results with SA and a greedy-tuned quantum annealing baseline. In both simulations and experiments, BBB-DCQO consistently achieved higher-quality solutions with significantly reduced computational overhead, showcasing the effectiveness of integrating counterdiabatic quantum methods into branch-and-bound to address hard non-convex optimization tasks.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15367'&gt;arXiv:2504.15367&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 21 Apr 2025 18:19:19 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

In this paper, we present a rigorous mathematical framework for expressing high-order derivatives of functional TTNs, both with or without constraints. Our framework decomposes the total derivative of a given TTN into a summation of TTNs, each corresponding to the partial derivatives of the original TTN. Using this decomposition, we derive the Taylor expansion of vector-valued functions subject to ordinary differential equation constraints or algebraic constraints imposed by Runge--Kutta (RK) methods. As a concrete application, we employ this framework to construct order conditions for RK methods. Due to the intrinsic tensor properties of partial derivatives and the separable tensor structure in RK methods, the Taylor expansion of numerical solutions can be obtained in a manner analogous to that of exact solutions using tensor operators. This enables the order conditions of RK methods to be established by directly comparing the Taylor expansions of the exact and numerical solutions, eliminating the need for mathematical induction. For a given function $\vector{f}$, we derive sharper order conditions that go beyond the classical ones, enabling the identification of situations where a standard RK scheme of order {\it p} achieves unexpectedly higher convergence order for the particular function. These results establish new connections between tensor network theory and classical numerical methods, potentially opening new avenues for both analytical exploration and practical computation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15516'&gt;arXiv:2504.15516&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 22 Apr 2025 01:26:51 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Emergent Kitaev materials in synthetic Fermi-Hubbard bilayers</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15755</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Daniel González-Cuadra, Alejandro Bermudez&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We investigate the emergence of bond-directional spin-spin interactions in a synthetic Fermi-Hubbard bilayer that can be realized with ultracold fermions in Raman optical lattices. The model exploits synthetic dimensions to couple two honeycomb layers, each corresponding to a different hyperfine atomic state, via Raman-assisted tunneling and, moreover, via an inter-layer Hubbard repulsion due to the cold-atom scattering. In the strong-coupling regime at half filling, we derive effective spin Hamiltonians for the kinetic exchange featuring Kitaev, Heisenberg, off-diagonal exchange ($\Gamma$-couplings), as well as tunable Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions. We identify specific configurations that generate both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic Kitaev couplings with various perturbations of relevance to Kitaev materials, providing a tunable platform that can explore how quantum spin liquids emerge from itinerant fermion systems. We analyze the Fermi-liquid and Mott-insulating phases, highlighting a correspondence between Dirac and Majorana quasi-particles, with possible phase transitions thereof. In an extreme anisotropic limit, we show that the model reduces to an inter-layer ribbon in a quasi-1D ladder, allowing for a numerical study of the correlated ground state using matrix product states. We find a transition from a symmetry-protected topological insulator to a Kitaev-like regime characterized by nonlocal string order. Our results establish that cold-atom quantum simulators based on Raman optical lattices can be a playground for extended Kitaev models, bridging itinerant fermionic systems and spin-liquid physics.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15755'&gt;arXiv:2504.15755&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 22 Apr 2025 10:07:56 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Multi-Scale Tensorial Summation and Dimensional Reduction Guided Neural Network for Edge Detection</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15770</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Lei Xu, Mehmet Yamac, Mete Ahishali, Moncef Gabbouj&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Edge detection has attracted considerable attention thanks to its exceptional ability to enhance performance in downstream computer vision tasks. In recent years, various deep learning methods have been explored for edge detection tasks resulting in a significant performance improvement compared to conventional computer vision algorithms. In neural networks, edge detection tasks require considerably large receptive fields to provide satisfactory performance. In a typical convolutional operation, such a large receptive field can be achieved by utilizing a significant number of consecutive layers, which yields deep network structures. Recently, a Multi-scale Tensorial Summation (MTS) factorization operator was presented, which can achieve very large receptive fields even from the initial layers. In this paper, we propose a novel MTS Dimensional Reduction (MTS-DR) module guided neural network, MTS-DR-Net, for the edge detection task. The MTS-DR-Net uses MTS layers, and corresponding MTS-DR blocks as a new backbone to remove redundant information initially. Such a dimensional reduction module enables the neural network to focus specifically on relevant information (i.e., necessary subspaces). Finally, a weight U-shaped refinement module follows MTS-DR blocks in the MTS-DR-Net. We conducted extensive experiments on two benchmark edge detection datasets: BSDS500 and BIPEDv2 to verify the effectiveness of our model. The implementation of the proposed MTS-DR-Net can be found at https://github.com/LeiXuAI/MTS-DR-Net.git.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15770'&gt;arXiv:2504.15770&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 22 Apr 2025 10:28:10 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Moment Tensor Potential and Equivariant Tensor Network Potential with explicit dispersion interactions</title>

Shapeev&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; In this study, we investigate the effect of incorporating explicit dispersion interactions in the functional form of machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs), particularly in the Moment Tensor Potential and Equivariant Tensor Network potential for accurate modeling of liquid carbon tetrachloride, methane, and toluene. We show that explicit incorporation of dispersion interactions via D2 and D3 corrections significantly improves the accuracy of MLIPs when the cutoff radius is set to a commonly used value of 5 -- 6 \r{A}. We also show that for carbon tetrachloride and methane, a substantial improvement in accuracy can be achieved by extending the cutoff radius to 7.5 \r{A}. However, for accurate modeling of toluene, explicit incorporation of dispersion remains important. Furthermore, we find that MLIPs incorporating dispersion interactions via D2 reach a close level of accuracy to those incorporating D3, and D2 is suitable for accurate modeling of the systems in the study, while being less computationally expensive. We evaluated the accuracy of MLIPs in dimer binding curves compared to ab initio data and in predicting density and radial distribution functions compared to experiments.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15760'&gt;arXiv:2504.15760&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 22 Apr 2025 10:11:54 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Robust Mixed-State Cluster States and Spurious Topological Entanglement Negativity</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Seunghun Lee, Eun-Gook Moon&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We investigate 1D and 2D cluster states under local decoherence to assess the robustness of their mixed-state subsystem symmetry-protected topological (SSPT) order. By exactly computing fidelity correlators via dimensional reduction of effective statistical mechanics models, we pinpoint the critical error rate for strong-to-weak spontaneous breaking of strong subsystem symmetry. Without resorting to the replica trick, we demonstrate that mixed-state SSPT order remains remarkably robust up to the maximal decoherence rate when noise respects strong subsystem symmetry. Furthermore, we propose that the mixed-state SSPT order can be detected by a constant correction to the area-law scaling of entanglement negativity, termed spurious topological entanglement negativity. This also highlights that topological entanglement negativity, a widely used diagnostic for mixed-state topological order, is generally not invariant under finite-depth quantum channels.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16165'&gt;arXiv:2504.16165&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 22 Apr 2025 18:00:02 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Kronecker states: a powerful source of multipartite maximally entangled states in quantum information</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16256</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Walther Gonzalez&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; In quantum information theory, maximally entangled states, specifically locally maximally entangled (LME) states, are essential for quantum protocols. While many focus on bipartite entanglement, applications such as quantum error correction and multiparty secret sharing rely on multipartite entanglement. These LME states naturally appear in the invariant subspaces of tensor products of irreducible representations of the symmetric group $S_n$, called Kronecker subspaces, whose dimensions are the Kronecker coefficients. A Kronecker subspace is a space of multipartite LME states that entangle high-dimensional Hilbert spaces. Although these states can be derived from Clebsch-Gordan coefficients of $S_n$, known methods are inefficient even for small $n$. A quantum-information-based alternative comes from entanglement concentration protocols, where Kronecker subspaces arise in the isotypic decomposition of multiple copies of entangled states. Closed forms have been found for the multiqubit $W$-class states, but not in general. This thesis extends that approach to any multiqubit system. We first propose a graphical construction called W-state Stitching, where multiqubit entangled states are represented as tensor networks built from $W$ states. By analyzing the isotypic decomposition of copies of these graph states, corresponding graph Kronecker states can be constructed. In particular, graph states of generic multiqubit systems can generate any Kronecker subspace. We explicitly construct bases for three- and four-qubit systems and show that the W-stitching technique also serves as a valuable tool for multiqubit entanglement classification. These results may open new directions in multipartite entanglement resource theories, with bipartite and tripartite $W$ states as foundational elements, and asymptotic analysis based on Kronecker states.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16256'&gt;arXiv:2504.16256&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 22 Apr 2025 20:30:52 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Augmenting Simulated Noisy Quantum Data Collection by Orders of Magnitude Using Pre-Trajectory Sampling with Batched Execution</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16297</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Taylor L. Patti, Thien Nguyen, Justin G. Lietz, Alexander J. McCaskey, Brucek Khailany&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Classically simulating quantum systems is challenging, as even noiseless $n$-qubit quantum states scale as $2^n$. The complexity of noisy quantum systems is even greater, requiring $2^n \times 2^n$-dimensional density matrices. Various approximations reduce density matrix overhead, including quantum trajectory-based methods, which instead use an ensemble of $m \ll 2^n$ noisy states. While this method is dramatically more efficient, current implementations use unoptimized sampling, redundant state preparation, and single-shot data collection. In this manuscript, we present the Pre-Trajectory Sampling technique, increasing the efficiency and utility of trajectory simulations by tailoring error types, batching sampling without redundant computation, and collecting error information. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method with both a mature statevector simulation of a 35-qubit quantum error-correction code and a preliminary tensor network simulation of 85 qubits, yielding speedups of up to $10^6$x and $16$x, as well as generating massive datasets of one trillion and one million shots, respectively.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16297'&gt;arXiv:2504.16297&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 22 Apr 2025 22:36:18 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Nontrivial entanglement passively mediated by a quenched magnetic impurity</title>

Manuel&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We investigate the entanglement properties of a Kondo system undergoing a transition to a state with a quenched magnetic impurity, using the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) method. We focus on a two-channel spin-1 Kondo impurity with single-ion anisotropy, where a quantum phase transition occurs between two topologically distinct local Fermi liquids. In the fully screened Kondo phase, realized at lower anisotropies, the entangled region surrounding the magnetic impurity mimics the Kondo screening cloud, although its length does not follow the conventional behavior. In contrast, beyond the transition, the system enters a non-Landau Fermi liquid phase with a markedly different entanglement structure: as the impurity is quenched and disentangled from the rest of the system due to the breakdown of the Kondo effect, the two conduction channels coupled only through the impurity develop a significant degree of entanglement with one another. Our findings demonstrate that a quenched magnetic impurity can passively and efficiently mediate entanglement between spatially separated conduction bands.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16308'&gt;arXiv:2504.16308&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 22 Apr 2025 23:01:28 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Urei Miura&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We introduce a multi-species generalization of the asymmetric simple exclusion process (ASEP) with a ``no-passing" constraint, forbidding overtaking, on a one-dimensional open chain. This no-passing rule fragments the Hilbert space into an exponential number of disjoint sectors labeled by the particle sequence, leading to relaxation dynamics that depend sensitively on the initial ordering. We construct exact matrix-product steady states in every particle sequence sector and derive closed-form expressions for the particle-number distribution and two-point particle correlation functions. In the two-species case, we identify a parameter regime where some sectors relax in finite time while others exhibit metastable relaxation dynamics, revealing the coexistence of fast and slow dynamics and strong particle sequence sector dependence. Our results uncover a novel mechanism for non-equilibrium metastability arising from Hilbert space fragmentation in exclusion processes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16363'&gt;arXiv:2504.16363&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 23 Apr 2025 02:32:00 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Simulating Quantum Circuits with Tree Tensor Networks using Density-Matrix Renormalization Group Algorithm</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16718</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Aditya Dubey, Zeki Zeybek, Peter Schmelcher&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Quantum computing offers the potential for computational abilities that can go beyond classical machines. However, they are still limited by several challenges such as noise, decoherence, and gate errors. As a result, efficient classical simulation of quantum circuits is vital not only for validating and benchmarking quantum hardware but also for gaining deeper insights into the behavior of quantum algorithms. A promising framework for classical simulation is provided by tensor networks. Recently, the Density-Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) algorithm was developed for simulating quantum circuits using matrix product states (MPS). Although MPS is efficient for representing quantum states with one-dimensional correlation structures, the fixed linear geometry restricts the expressive power of the MPS. In this work, we extend the DMRG algorithm for simulating quantum circuits to tree tensor networks (TTNs). The framework employs a variational compression scheme that optimizes the TTN to approximate the evolved quantum state. To benchmark the method, we simulate random circuits and the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) with various two-qubit gate connectivities. For the random circuits, we devise tree-like gate layouts that are suitable for TTN and show that TTN requires less memory than MPS for the simulations. For the QAOA circuits, a naive TTN construction that exploits graph structure significantly improves the simulation fidelities. Our findings show that the DMRG algorithm with TTNs provides a promising framework for simulating quantum circuits, particularly when gate connectivities exhibit clustering or a hierarchical structure.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16718'&gt;arXiv:2504.16718&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:48:03 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Anomalous matrix product operator symmetries and 1D mixed-state phases</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Xiao-Qi Sun&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The renormalization group for matrix product density operators (MPDOs) provides a powerful framework for describing one-dimensional mixed-state phases of matter and the renormalization fixed points (RFPs) are representative states for analyzing nontrivial phases. Recently, it was found that anomalous symmetries can provide a fundamental obstruction for certain short-range correlated mixed states to be efficiently prepared. In this work, we consider generalized symmetries including non-invertible ones realized microscopically as matrix product operators (MPOs), and study the physical implications of their quantum anomaly on the MPDO RFPs. We prove that MPDOs with strong anomalous MPO symmetries cannot be prepared from a normal matrix product state in the trivial phase via a translationally invariant finite-depth local quantum channel. We explicitly construct a general class of zero-correlation-length MPDO RFPs that exhibit strong anomalous MPO symmetries, and these MPDO RFPs form a distinct class from those that can be efficiently prepared as a consequence of quantum anomaly. Nonetheless, we further prove that all the constructed MPDO RFPs can be prepared from product states by finite-depth quantum circuit with measurements and feedforward.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16985'&gt;arXiv:2504.16985&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 23 Apr 2025 18:00:00 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

Generating large-scale random quantum states is crucial for quantum computing and many-body physics, yet remains a key challenge. We present a practical method based on local measurements of random Tensor Networks, focusing on random Matrix Product States (MPS) generated by two distinct quantum circuit architectures, both feasible on near-term devices. We certify the emergent quantum randomness using the frame potential and establish a mapping between its behavior and the statistical mechanics of a domain wall particle model. In both architectures, the effect of quantum measurements induces a nontrivial confinement mechanism, where domain walls are either trapped by an external potential or bound in pairs to form meson-like excitations. Our results, supported by both exact analytical calculations and numerical simulations, suggest that confinement is a general mechanism underlying random state generation in broader settings with local measurements, including quantum circuits and chaotic dynamics.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16995'&gt;arXiv:2504.16995&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 23 Apr 2025 18:00:02 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Efficient witnessing and testing of magic in mixed quantum states</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18098</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Tobias Haug, Poetri Sonya Tarabunga&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Nonstabilizerness or `magic' is a crucial resource for quantum computers which can be distilled from noisy quantum states. However, determining the magic of mixed quantum has been a notoriously difficult task. Here, we provide efficient witnesses of magic based on the stabilizer R\'enyi entropy which robustly indicate the presence of magic and quantitatively estimate magic monotones. We also design efficient property testing algorithms to reliably distinguish states with high and low magic, assuming the entropy is bounded. We apply our methods to certify the number of noisy T-gates under a wide class of noise models. Additionally, using the IonQ quantum computer, we experimentally verify the magic of noisy random quantum circuits. Surprisingly, we find that magic is highly robust, persisting even under exponentially strong noise. Our witnesses can also be efficiently computed for matrix product states, revealing that subsystems of many-body quantum states can contain extensive magic despite entanglement. Finally, our work also has direct implications for cryptography and pseudomagic: To mimic high magic states with as little magic as possible, one requires an extensive amount of entropy. This implies that entropy is a necessary resource to hide magic from eavesdroppers. Our work uncovers powerful tools to verify and study the complexity of noisy quantum systems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18098'&gt;arXiv:2504.18098&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 25 Apr 2025 05:56:09 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>On Ising model in magnetic field on the lattice</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18744</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Raghav G. Jha&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We conjecture an approximate expression for the free energy in the thermodynamic limit of the classical square lattice Ising model in a uniform (real) magnetic field. The zero-field result is well known due to Onsager for more than eighty years, but no such result exists for a nonzero magnetic field on a regular lattice. We verify our conjecture using numerical tensor renormalization group (TRG) methods and find good agreement with a maximum deviation of $\sim2\%$ from the numerical results for the free energy across all $\beta$ and real magnetic field, $h$.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18744'&gt;arXiv:2504.18744&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 25 Apr 2025 23:43:59 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Classical simulation of parity-preserving quantum circuits</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19317</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Carolin Wille, Sergii Strelchuk&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We present a classical simulation method for fermionic quantum systems which, without loss of generality, can be represented by parity-preserving circuits made of two-qubit gates in a brick-wall structure. We map such circuits to a fermionic tensor network and introduce a novel decomposition of non-Matchgate gates into a Gaussian fermionic tensor and a residual quartic term, inspired by interacting fermionic systems. The quartic term is independent of the specific gate, which allows us to precompute intermediate results independently of the exact circuit structure and leads to significant speedups when compared to other methods. Our decomposition suggests a natural perturbative expansion which can be turned into an algorithm to compute measurement outcomes and observables to finite accuracy when truncating at some order of the expansion. For particle number conserving gates, our decomposition features a unique truncation cutoff reducing the computational effort for high precision calculations. Our algorithm significantly lowers resource requirements for simulating parity-preserving circuits while retaining high accuracy, making it suitable for simulations of interacting systems in quantum chemistry and material science. Lastly, we discuss how our algorithm compares to other classical simulation methods for fermionic quantum systems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19317'&gt;arXiv:2504.19317&lt;/a&gt;] Published Sun, 27 Apr 2025 17:42:39 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Non-stabilizerness generation in a multi-particle quantum walk</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19750</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Cătălin Paşcu Moca, Doru Sticlet, Balázs Dóra, Angelo Valli, Dominik Szombathy, Gergely Zaránd&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We investigate the generation of non-stabilizerness, or magic, in a multi-particle quantum walk by analyzing the time evolution of the stabilizer R\'enyi entropy $M_2$. Our study considers both single- and two-particle quantum walks in the framework of the XXZ Heisenberg model with varying interaction strengths. We demonstrate that the spread of magic follows the light-cone structure dictated by the system's dynamics, with distinct behaviors emerging in the easy-plane ($\Delta &lt; 1$) and easy-axis ($\Delta &gt; 1$) regimes. For $\Delta &lt; 1$, magic generation is primarily governed by single-particle dynamics, while for $\Delta &gt; 1$, doublon propagation dominates, resulting in a significantly slower growth of $M_2$. Furthermore, the magic exhibits logarithmic growth in time for both one and two-particle dynamics. Additionally, by examining the Pauli spectrum, we show that the statistical distribution of level spacings exhibits Poissonian behavior, independent of interaction strength or particle number. Our results shed light on the role of interactions on magic generation in a many-body system.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19750'&gt;arXiv:2504.19750&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 28 Apr 2025 12:50:34 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian Learning of Triplon Excitations in an Artificial Nanoscale Molecular Quantum Magnet</title>

Lado&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Extracting the Hamiltonian parameters of nanoscale quantum magnets from experimental measurements is a significant challenge in quantum matter. Here we establish a machine learning strategy to extract the parameters of a spin Hamiltonian from inelastic spectroscopy with scanning tunneling microscopy, and we demonstrate this methodology experimentally with an artificial nanoscale molecular magnet based on cobalt phthalocyanine (CoPC) molecules on NbSe$_2$. We show that this technique allows us to extract the Hamiltonian parameters of a quantum magnet from the differential conductance, including the substrate-induced spatial variation of the exchange couplings. Our methodology leverages a machine learning algorithm trained on exact quantum many-body simulations with tensor networks of finite quantum magnets, leading to a methodology that predicts the Hamiltonian parameters of CoPC quantum magnets of arbitrary size. Our results demonstrate how quantum many-body methods and machine learning enable us to learn a microscopic description of nanoscale quantum many-body systems with scanning tunneling spectroscopy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20711'&gt;arXiv:2504.20711&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 29 Apr 2025 12:43:35 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Trotterization is substantially efficient for low-energy states</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20746</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Kaoru Mizuta, Tomotaka Kuwahara&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Trotterization is one of the central approaches for simulating quantum many-body dynamics on quantum computers or tensor networks. In addition to its simple implementation, recent studies have revealed that its error and cost can be reduced if the initial state is closed in the low-energy subspace. However, the improvement by the low-energy property rapidly vanishes as the Trotter order grows in the previous studies, and thus, it is mysterious whether there exists genuine advantage of low-energy initial states. In this Letter, we resolve this problem by proving the optimal error bound and cost of Trotterization for low-energy initial states. For generic local Hamiltonians composed of positive-semidefinite terms, we show that the Trotter error is at most linear in the initial state energy $\Delta$ and polylogarithmic in the system size $N$. As a result, the computational cost becomes substantially small for low-energy states with $\Delta \in o(Ng)$ compared to the one for arbitrary initial states, where $g$ denotes the energy per site and $Ng$ means the whole-system energy. Our error bound and cost of Trotterization achieve the theoretically-best scaling in the initial state energy $\Delta$. In addition, they can be partially extended to weakly-correlated initial states having low-energy expectation values, which are not necessarily closed in the low-energy subspace. Our results will pave the way for fast and accurate simulation of low-energy states, which are one central targets in condensed matter physics and quantum chemistry.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20746'&gt;arXiv:2504.20746&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 29 Apr 2025 13:27:14 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>TT-LoRA MoE: Unifying Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning and Sparse Mixture-of-Experts</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21190</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Pradip Kunwar, Minh N. Vu, Maanak Gupta, Mahmoud Abdelsalam, Manish Bhattarai&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We propose Tensor-Trained Low-Rank Adaptation Mixture of Experts (TT-LoRA MoE), a novel computational framework integrating Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) with sparse MoE routing to address scalability challenges in large model deployments. Unlike traditional MoE approaches, which face substantial computational overhead as expert counts grow, TT-LoRA MoE decomposes training into two distinct, optimized stages. First, we independently train lightweight, tensorized low-rank adapters (TT-LoRA experts), each specialized for specific tasks. Subsequently, these expert adapters remain frozen, eliminating inter-task interference and catastrophic forgetting in multi-task setting. A sparse MoE router, trained separately, dynamically leverages base model representations to select exactly one specialized adapter per input at inference time, automating expert selection without explicit task specification. Comprehensive experiments confirm our architecture retains the memory efficiency of low-rank adapters, seamlessly scales to large expert pools, and achieves robust task-level optimization. This structured decoupling significantly enhances computational efficiency and flexibility: uses only 2% of LoRA, 0.3% of Adapters and 0.03% of AdapterFusion parameters and outperforms AdapterFusion by 4 value in multi-tasking, enabling practical and scalable multi-task inference deployments.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21190'&gt;arXiv:2504.21190&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 29 Apr 2025 21:46:43 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>A Unified Variational Framework for Quantum Excited States</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21459</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Shi-Xin Zhang, Lei Wang&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Determining quantum excited states is crucial across physics and chemistry but presents significant challenges for variational methods, primarily due to the need to enforce orthogonality to lower-energy states, often requiring state-specific optimization, penalty terms, or specialized ansatz constructions. We introduce a novel variational principle that overcomes these limitations, enabling the \textit{simultaneous} determination of multiple low-energy excited states. The principle is based on minimizing the trace of the inverse overlap matrix multiplied by the Hamiltonian matrix, $\mathrm{Tr}(\mathbf{S}^{-1}\mathbf{H})$, constructed from a set of \textit{non-orthogonal} variational states $\{|\psi_i\rangle\}$. Here, $\mathbf{H}_{ij} = \langle\psi_i | H | \psi_j\rangle$ and $\mathbf{S}_{ij} = \langle\psi_i | \psi_j\rangle$ are the elements of the Hamiltonian and overlap matrices, respectively. This approach variationally optimizes the entire low-energy subspace spanned by $\{|\psi_i\rangle\}$ without explicit orthogonality constraints or penalty functions. We demonstrate the power and generality of this method across diverse physical systems and variational ansatzes: calculating the low-energy spectrum of 1D Heisenberg spin chains using matrix product states, finding vibrational spectrum of Morse potential using quantics tensor trains for real-space wavefunctions, and determining excited states for 2D fermionic Hubbard model with variational quantum circuits. In all applications, the method accurately and simultaneously obtains multiple lowest-lying energy levels and their corresponding states, showcasing its potential as a unified and flexible framework for calculating excited states on both classical and quantum computational platforms.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21459'&gt;arXiv:2504.21459&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 30 Apr 2025 09:28:04 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

Inspired by twisted boundary conditions in equilibrium systems, this approach modifies the temporal evolution of the system upon completing a spatial loop, enabling the identification of distinct Floquet phases, including discrete time crystals (DTCs). By studying the spectral form factor (SFF) and its response to the twist, we uncover signatures of time-crystalline order, which exhibits periodic dependence on the twist parameter analogous to the Little-Parks effect in superconductors. We apply this framework to the kicked Ising model, demonstrating that our twist can distinguish time-crystalline phases.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21461'&gt;arXiv:2504.21461&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 30 Apr 2025 09:29:36 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Superconductivity and trimers on attractive-$U$ Hubbard ladders</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21630</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Ian Pilé, Evgeni Burovski&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We investigate the interplay between superconducting correlations and trimer formation in polarized two-component Fermi gases confined to multileg attractive-$U$ Hubbard ladders. Employing density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations, we explore the effects of spin-dependent tunneling amplitudes on these systems. Specifically, we analyze how bound states of three fermions (trimers) impact Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) superconducting correlations at commensurate charge carrier densities, where $2n_{\uparrow} = n_{\downarrow}$. In one-dimensional (1D) systems, trimer formation is known to suppress FFLO correlations exponentially. Our results demonstrate that this suppression persists on ladder lattices of small width, effectively mirroring the 1D behavior. However, we find a striking departure from the 1D regime as the ladder width increases. On ladders with a width of four legs, the influence of trimers on superconducting correlations becomes negligible, suggesting that wider ladder systems provide a distinct environment where FFLO-like pairing remains robust even in the presence of trimer states. These findings underscore the dimensional crossover in Hubbard systems and shed light on the mechanisms governing superconductivity and bound-state formation in strongly correlated fermionic systems. Our work has implications for understanding unconventional superconductivity in strongly correlated systems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21630'&gt;arXiv:2504.21630&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 30 Apr 2025 13:33:06 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Universal Structures and Emergent Geometry from Large-$c$ BCFT Ensemble</title>

We apply the results to computing ensemble average of copies of multi-point correlation functions of boundary changing operators (BCO), and find the results in agreement with one copy of the Virasoro TQFT. Further, we consider ensemble average of CFT path-integrals expressed as tensor networks of BCO correlation functions using the formalism developed in arXiv:2210.12127, arXiv:2311.18005 and arXiv:2403.03179. We find a natural emergence of locality and a loop-sum structure reminiscent of lattice integrable models. We illustrate this universal structure through explicit examples at genus zero and genus one. Moreover, we provide strong evidence that, at leading order in large-$c$, the results match those of three-dimensional Einstein gravity. In the presence of closed CFT operator insertions, generalized free fields emerge, with their correlation functions governed by the shortest paths connecting the insertions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21660'&gt;arXiv:2504.21660&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 30 Apr 2025 14:02:05 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Improved Lanczos Algorithm using Matrix Product States</title>

Mendl&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We improve the Lanczos algorithm using the matrix product state representation proposed in Phys. Rev. B 85, 205119 (2012). As an alternative to the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG), the Lanczos algorithm avoids local minima and can directly find multiple low-lying eigenstates. However, its performance and accuracy are affected by the truncation required to maintain the efficiency of the tensor network representation. In this work, we enhance its convergence by restarting with multiple states. We benchmark our method on one-dimensional instances of the Fermi-Hubbard model with 8 sites and the Heisenberg model with 16 sites in an external field, using numerical experiments targeting the first five lowest eigenstates. Across these tests, our approach obtains accuracy improvements of three to seven orders of magnitude. Finally, we extend the Heisenberg model simulation to a lattice with 30 sites to highlight its scalability.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21786'&gt;arXiv:2504.21786&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 30 Apr 2025 16:45:25 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Preparation Circuits for Matrix Product States by Classical Variational Disentanglement</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Refik Mansuroglu, Norbert Schuch&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We study the classical compilation of quantum circuits for the preparation of matrix product states (MPS), which are quantum states of low entanglement with an efficient classical description. Our algorithm represents a near-term alternative to previous sequential approaches by reverse application of a disentangler, which can be found by minimizing bipartite entanglement measures after the application of a layer of parameterized disentangling gates. Since a successful disentangler is expected to decrease the bond dimension on average, such a layer-by-layer optimization remains classically efficient even for deep circuits. Additionally, as the Schmidt coefficients of all bonds are locally accessible through the canonical $\Gamma$-$\Lambda$ form of an MPS, the optimization algorithm can be heavily parallelized. We discuss guarantees and limitations to trainability and show numerical results for ground states of one-dimensional, local Hamiltonians as well as artificially spread out entanglement among multiple qubits using error correcting codes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21298'&gt;arXiv:2504.21298&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 30 Apr 2025 04:13:01 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Sebastian Leontica, Andrew G. Green&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Matrix product states are useful representations for a large variety of naturally occurring quantum states. Studying their typical properties is important for understanding universal behavior, including quantum chaos and thermalization, as well as the limits of classical simulations of quantum devices. We show that the usual ensemble of sequentially generated random matrix product states (RMPS) using local Haar random unitaries is not uniform when viewed as a restriction of the full Hilbert space. As a result, the entanglement across the chain exhibits an anomalous asymmetry under spatial inversion. We show how to construct an unbiased measure starting from the left-canonical form and design a Metropolis algorithm for sampling random states. Some properties of this new ensemble are investigated both analytically and numerically, such as the resulting resolution of identity over matrix product states and the typical entanglement spectrum, which is found to differ from the sequentially generated case.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00073'&gt;arXiv:2505.00073&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 30 Apr 2025 18:00:02 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Contemporary tensor network approaches to gapless and topological phases in an extended Bose-Hubbard ladder</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00106</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Yuma Watanabe, Ravindra W. Chhajlany, Maciej Lewenstein, Tobias Graß, Utso Bhattacharya&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The development of numerically efficient computational methods has facilitated in depth studies of various correlated phases of matter including critical and topological phases. A quantum Monte-Carlo study of an extended Bose-Hubbard ladder has recently been used to identify an exotic phase with hidden order, where superfluid correlations coexist with string order, dubbed a Haldane superfluid (HSF). However, finite-size methods can struggle to uniquely determine the boundaries of quasi-long-range ordered states with nonlocal, e.g. string-like, correlations. In the present Letter, we revisit the HSF scenario using tensor network algorithms specialized for finite/infinite (quasi-)1D systems, \textit{i.e.} the well-governed finite-size density matrix renormalization group (DMRG), and the state-of-the-art infinite-size variational uniform matrix product state (VUMPS) methods. While DMRG results extrapolated to the thermodynamic limit are compatible with a putative HSF, the results from the VUMPS calculations provide sharper phase boundaries that leave no room for such a topological superfluid. Our results demonstrate the crucial advantage of the VUMPS in characterizing topological and critical interacting phases providing the precise phase boundaries.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00106'&gt;arXiv:2505.00106&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 30 Apr 2025 18:20:42 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Tree tensor network hierarchical equations of motion based on time-dependent variational principle for efficient open quantum dynamics in structured thermal environments</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00126</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Xinxian Chen, Ignacio Franco&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We introduce an efficient method TTN-HEOM for exactly calculating the open quantum dynamics for driven quantum systems interacting with highly structured bosonic baths by combining the tree tensor network (TTN) decomposition scheme to the bexcitonic generalization of the numerically-exact hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM). The method yields a series of quantum master equations for all core tensors in the TTN that efficiently and accurately capture the open quantum dynamics for non-Markovian environments to all orders in the system-bath interaction. These master equations are constructed based on the time-dependent Dirac--Frenkel variational principle which isolates the optimal dynamics for the core tensors given the TTN ansatz. The dynamics converges to the HEOM when increasing the rank of the core tensors, a limit in which the TTN ansatz becomes exact. We introduce TENSO, Tensor Equations for Non-Markovian Structured Open systems, as a general-purpose Python code to propagate the TTN-HEOM dynamics. We implement three general propagators for the coupled master equations: Two fixed-rank methods that require a constant memory footprint during the dynamics, and one adaptive-rank method with variable memory footprint controlled by the target level of computational error. We exemplify the utility of these methods by simulating a two-level system coupled to a structured bath containing one Drude--Lorentz component and eight Brownian oscillators, which is beyond what can presently be computed using the standard HEOM. Our results show that the TTN-HEOM is capable to simulate both dephasing and relaxation dynamics of driven quantum system interacting with structured baths, even those of chemical complexity, with affordable computational cost.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00126'&gt;arXiv:2505.00126&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 30 Apr 2025 18:48:05 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Simplified Fermionic Scattering State Preparation for the NISQ Era</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Michael Hite&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; With quantum computers steadily improving, large volume quantum scattering simulations is getting very close. Yet, in the noisy intermediate scale quantum (NISQ) era, we are limited to shallow circuits on the order of a thousand layers. Thus, accurate and efficient state preparation methods are needed. We introduce a simplified fermionic scattering state preparation method that reduces circuit depth significantly by partially relaxing the fermionic condition. Using the 1+1D transverse field Ising model as our test bed with exact diagonalization and time evolving block decimation with matrix product states, we show that our simplified states retain nearly all of the behavior of the true fermionic state while being prepared on just a handful of qubits. We also show promising early results on IonQ Forte 1.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00476'&gt;arXiv:2505.00476&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 01 May 2025 12:03:58 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Accelerating two-dimensional tensor network contractions using QR-decompositions</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00494</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Yining Zhang, Qi Yang, Philippe Corboz&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Infinite projected entangled-pair states (iPEPS) provide a powerful tool for studying strongly correlated systems directly in the thermodynamic limit. A core component of the algorithm is the approximate contraction of the iPEPS, where the computational bottleneck typically lies in the singular value or eigenvalue decompositions involved in the renormalization step. This is particularly true on GPUs, where tensor contractions are substantially faster than these decompositions. Here we propose a contraction scheme for $C_{4v}$-symmetric tensor networks based on combining the corner transfer matrix renormalization group (CTMRG) with QR-decompositions which are substantially faster -- especially on GPUs. Our approach achieves up to two orders of magnitude speedup compared to standard CTMRG and yields state-of-the-art results for the Heisenberg and $J_1$-$J_2$ models in about one hour on an H100 GPU.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00494'&gt;arXiv:2505.00494&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 01 May 2025 12:48:26 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Strange correlator and string order parameter for non-invertible symmetry protected topological phases in 1+1d</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00673</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Da-Chuan Lu, Fu Xu, Yi-Zhuang You&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; In this paper, we construct strange correlators and string order parameters for non-invertible symmetry protected topological phases (NISPTs) in 1+1d quantum lattice spin models. The strange correlator exhibits long-range order when evaluated between two distinct NISPTs and decays exponentially otherwise. We show that strange charged operators inserted into the strange correlator are linked to the interface algebra (boundary tube algebra) and are non-trivial when all its irreducible representations have dimensions greater than one. We discuss the generalization to higher dimensions. The string order parameter is obtained by contracting the truncated symmetry operator with charge decoration operators, which are determined by the NISPT action tensors. We illustrate the above construction using the three NISPTs of $\text{Rep}(D_8)$ and demonstrate the extraction of categorical data via tensor networks, particularly through the ZX calculus. Finally, we show that the entanglement spectrum degeneracy is determined by the irreducible representations of the interface algebra when assuming non-invertible symmetry on-site condition.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00673'&gt;arXiv:2505.00673&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 01 May 2025 17:26:43 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Simple Holography in General Spacetimes</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00695</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Raphael Bousso, Elisa Tabor&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The simple or "outermost" wedge in AdS is the portion of the entanglement wedge that can be reconstructed with sub-exponential effort from CFT data. Here we furnish a definition in arbitrary spacetimes: given an input wedge $a$ analogous to a CFT boundary region, the simple wedge $z(a)$ is the largest wedge accessible by a "zigzag," a certain sequence of antinormal lightsheets. We show that $z(a)$ is a throat, and that it is contained in every other throat. This implies that $z(a)$ is unique; that it is contained in the generalized entanglement wedge; and that it reduces to the AdS prescription as a special case. The zigzag explicitly constructs a preferred Cauchy slice that renders the simple wedge accessible from $a$; thus it adds a novel structure even in AdS. So far, no spacelike construction is known to reproduce these results, even in time-symmetric settings. This may have implications for the modeling of holographic encoding by tensor networks.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00695'&gt;arXiv:2505.00695&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 01 May 2025 17:55:50 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

Firstly, it describes three main paradigms in this field of knowledge: gate-based quantum computers, quantum annealers, and tensor networks. The article also examines specific industrial applications, such as bin packing, job shop scheduling, and route planning for robots and vehicles. These applications demonstrate the potential of quantum computing to solve complex problems in the industry. The article concludes by presenting a vision of the directions the field will take in the coming years, also discussing the current limitations of quantum technology. Despite these limitations, quantum computing is emerging as a powerful tool to address industrial challenges in the future.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00891'&gt;arXiv:2505.00891&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 01 May 2025 22:13:12 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

The method is benchmarked on the two-leg ladder Hubbard model using both molecular orbital and momentum bases. Energy convergence is shown to be improved in the momentum basis compared to the molecular orbital basis for both the spin-quintet ground state and the spin-singlet excited state. We clarify the relationship between the compactness of the many-body wave function and the sparsity of the representation matrices of symmetry operations. Furthermore, the enhancement of the superconducting correlation function due to the Coulomb interaction is demonstrated. Our method highlights the importance of symmetry structure in random-sampling quantum simulation of correlated systems&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00914'&gt;arXiv:2505.00914&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 01 May 2025 23:23:37 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Shunsuke Sengoku, Hoi Chun Po, Haruki Watanabe&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Recent studies have revealed that frustration-free models, expressed as sums of finite-range interactions or hoppings, exhibit several properties markedly different from those of frustrated models. In this work, we demonstrate that, by relaxing the finite-range condition to allow for exponentially decaying hoppings, one can build gapped frustration-free systems that realize Chern insulators as well as quasi-degenerate ground states with finite-size splittings. Moreover, by permitting power-law decaying hoppings, we also construct a gapless band metal whose finite-size gap scales inversely with the system size $L$. These findings serve as an important step toward clarifying the general properties of frustration-free systems and those represented by tensor network states.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01010'&gt;arXiv:2505.01010&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 02 May 2025 05:20:48 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Topological pump and its plateau transitions of $N$-leg spin ladder</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Kota Yamamoto, Yoshihito Kuno, Tomonari Mizoguchi, Kazuki Sone, Yasuhiro Hatsugai&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; A topological pump on an $N\textrm{-}$leg spin ladder is discussed by introducing spatial clusterization whose adiabatic limit is a set of $2N\textrm{-}$site staircase clusters. We set a pump path in the parameter space that connects two different symmetry protected topological phases. By introducing a symmetry breaking staggered magnetic field, the system is always gapped during the pump. In the topological pump {thus obtained}, the bulk Chern number is given by the number of the critical points enclosed by the pump path. Plateau transitions characterized by the Chern number are demonstrated associated with deformation of the pump path. We find that there are $N$ critical points enclosed by the pump path for the $N\textrm{-}$leg ladder. The ground state phase diagram without symmetry breaking terms is numerically investigated by using the quantized Berry phase. We also discuss the physical picture of edge states in the diagonal boundary, and numerically demonstrate the bulk-edge correspondence for $N=2,3$ cases.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01153'&gt;arXiv:2505.01153&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 02 May 2025 09:57:03 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

It supports a wide range of features for electronic structure, multi-component (pre-Born-Oppenheimer), anharmonic vibrational structure, and vibronic calculations. In addition to the ground and excited state solvers, QCMaquis allows for time propagation of matrix product states based on the tangent-space formulation of time-dependent DMRG. The latest developments include transcorrelated electronic structure calculations, very recent vibrational and vibronic models, and a convenient Python wrapper, facilitating the interface with external libraries.

      <title>Fractionalized fermionic multicriticality in anisotropic Kitaev spin-orbital liquids</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01493</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Max Fornoville, Lukas Janssen&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We study the low-temperature phase diagram of quantum Kitaev-Heisenberg spin-orbital models with XXZ anisotropy on the honeycomb lattice. Within a parton mean-field theory, we identify three different quantum phases, distinguished by their symmetries. Besides a disordered spin-orbital liquid with unbroken U(1) x Z2 spin rotational symmetry, there are two orbital liquid phases characterized by spin long-range order. In these phases, the spin rotational symmetry is spontaneously broken down to residual U(1) and Z2 symmetries, respectively. The symmetric spin-orbital liquid features three flavors of linearly dispersing gapless Majorana fermions. In the symmetry-broken phases, one of the three Majorana excitations remains gapless, while the other two acquire a band gap. The transitions from the symmetric to the symmetry-broken phases are continuous and fall into the fractionalized Gross-Neveu-Z2* and Gross-Neveu-SO(2)* universality classes, respectively. The transition between the ordered phases is discontinuous. Using a renormalization group analysis based on the epsilon expansion, we demonstrate that the triple point in the phase diagram features fractionalized fermionic multicriticality with emergent SO(3) symmetry.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01493'&gt;arXiv:2505.01493&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 02 May 2025 18:00:00 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Polarization-Driven Charge Frustration and Emergent Phases in the One-Dimensional Extended Hubbard Model</title>

We show that charge frustration - induced by electronic polarization effects - stabilizes unconventional insulating states in the one-dimensional extended Hubbard model. Using exact diagonalization and density-matrix renormalization group, we uncover a charge-disordered phase that remains insulating despite lacking long-range order and possessing an effectively attractive on-site interaction - a behavior reminiscent of gapful spin liquids in frustrated spin systems. We also identify a fragile ferroelectric phase and a charge-density-wave state with emergent eight-site periodicity. These findings establish charge frustration, driven by charge-dipole interactions, as a robust mechanism for realizing exotic phases in low-dimensional correlated systems, with implications for organic conductors, transition-metal oxides, and ultracold polar molecules.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01725'&gt;arXiv:2505.01725&lt;/a&gt;] Published Sat, 03 May 2025 07:38:48 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>A Matrix Product State Representation of Boolean Functions</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01930</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Umut Eren Usturali, Claudio Chamon, Andrei E. Ruckenstein, Eduardo R. Mucciolo&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We introduce a novel normal form representation of Boolean functions in terms of products of binary matrices, hereafter referred to as the Binary Matrix Product (BMP) representation. BMPs are analogous to the Tensor-Trains (TT) and Matrix Product States (MPS) used, respectively, in applied mathematics and in quantum many-body physics to accelerate computations that are usually inaccessible by more traditional approaches. BMPs turn out to be closely related to Binary Decision Diagrams (BDDs), a powerful compressed representation of Boolean functions invented in the late 80s by Bryant that has found a broad range of applications in many areas of computer science and engineering. We present a direct and natural translation of BMPs into Binary Decision Diagrams (BDDs), and derive an elementary set of operations used to manipulate and combine BMPs that are analogous to those introduced by Bryant for BDDs. Both BDDs and BMPs are practical tools when the complexity of these representations, as measured by the maximum bond dimension of a BMP (or the accumulated bond dimension across the BMP matrix train) and the number of nodes of a BDD, remains polynomial in the number of bits, $n$. In both cases, controlling the complexity hinges on optimizing the order of the Boolean variables. BMPs offer the advantage that their construction and manipulation rely on simple linear algebra -- a compelling feature that can facilitate the development of open-source libraries that are both more flexible and easier to use than those currently available for BDDs. An initial implementation of a BMP library is available on GitHub, with the expectation that the close conceptual connection to TT and MPS techniques will motivate further development of BMP methods by researchers in these fields, potentially enabling novel applications to classical and quantum computing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01930'&gt;arXiv:2505.01930&lt;/a&gt;] Published Sat, 03 May 2025 21:48:39 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

We mainly use the level spectroscopic technique of two 36-site tori to investigate the ground-state phase diagram, and further characterize phases by spin, dimer and chiral correlation functions. The ground state has rich phases including several magnetic ordered phases like zigzag phase and tetrahedral phase, as well as several novel nonmagnetic phases, some of which exhibit valence bond solid behavior in their dimer correlation functions. However, we do not find direct evidence of a quantum spin liquid phase with spinon Fermi surface in this model. Our results can give a better understanding of the ground-state properties of the triangular Heisenberg model with ring-exchange interaction, and help to understand the relevant triangular materials.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02030'&gt;arXiv:2505.02030&lt;/a&gt;] Published Sun, 04 May 2025 08:37:03 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Partons from stabilizer codes</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Rafael A. Macedo, Carlo C. Bellinati, Weslei B. Fontana, Eric C. Andrade, Rodrigo G. Pereira&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The Gutzwiller projection of fermionic wave functions is a well-established method for generating variational wave functions describing exotic states of matter, such as quantum spin liquids. We investigate the conditions under which a projected wave function constructed from fermionic partons can be rigorously shown to possess topological order. We demonstrate that these conditions can be precisely determined in the case of projected Majorana stabilizer codes. We then use matrix product states to study states that interpolate between two distinct Majorana fermion codes, one yielding a $\mathbb Z_2$ spin liquid and the other a trivial polarized state upon projection. While the free-fermion states are adiabatically connected, we find that the projected states undergo a phase transition detected by the topological entanglement entropy. Our work underscores the profound impact of the Gutzwiller projection and cautions against inferring properties of quantum spin liquids solely from their unprojected counterparts.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02683'&gt;arXiv:2505.02683&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 05 May 2025 14:32:19 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Sequential Generation of Two-dimensional Super-area-law States with Local Parent Hamiltonian</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Wucheng Zhang&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We construct examples of highly entangled two-dimensional states by exploiting a correspondence between stochastic processes in $d$ dimensions and quantum states in $d+1$ dimensions. The entanglement structure of these states, which we explicitly calculate, can be tuned between area law, sub-volume law, and volume law. This correspondence also enables a sequential generation protocol: the states can be prepared through a series of unitary transformations acting on an auxiliary system. We also discuss the conditions under which these states have local, frustration-free parent Hamiltonians.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02914'&gt;arXiv:2505.02914&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 05 May 2025 18:00:10 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>HMAE: Self-Supervised Few-Shot Learning for Quantum Spin Systems</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03140</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Ibne Farabi Shihab, Sanjeda Akter, Anuj Sharma&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Quantum machine learning for spin and molecular systems faces critical challenges of scarce labeled data and computationally expensive simulations. To address these limitations, we introduce Hamiltonian-Masked Autoencoding (HMAE), a novel self-supervised framework that pre-trains transformers on unlabeled quantum Hamiltonians, enabling efficient few-shot transfer learning. Unlike random masking approaches, HMAE employs a physics-informed strategy based on quantum information theory to selectively mask Hamiltonian terms based on their physical significance. Experiments on 12,500 quantum Hamiltonians (60% real-world, 40% synthetic) demonstrate that HMAE achieves 85.3% $\pm$ 1.5% accuracy in phase classification and 0.15 $\pm$ 0.02 eV MAE in ground state energy prediction with merely 10 labeled examples - a statistically significant improvement (p &lt; 0.01) over classical graph neural networks (78.1% $\pm$ 2.1%) and quantum neural networks (76.8% $\pm$ 2.3%). Our method's primary advantage is exceptional sample efficiency - reducing required labeled examples by 3-5x compared to baseline methods - though we emphasize that ground truth values for fine-tuning and evaluation still require exact diagonalization or tensor networks. We explicitly acknowledge that our current approach is limited to small quantum systems (specifically limited to 12 qubits during training, with limited extension to 16-20 qubits in testing) and that, while promising within this regime, this size restriction prevents immediate application to larger systems of practical interest in materials science and quantum chemistry.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03140'&gt;arXiv:2505.03140&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 06 May 2025 03:32:16 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Typical Machine Learning Datasets as Low-Depth Quantum Circuits</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03399</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Florian J. Kiwit, Bernhard Jobst, Andre Luckow, Frank Pollmann, Carlos A. Riofrío&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Quantum machine learning (QML) is an emerging field that investigates the capabilities of quantum computers for learning tasks. While QML models can theoretically offer advantages such as exponential speed-ups, challenges in data loading and the ability to scale to relevant problem sizes have prevented demonstrations of such advantages on practical problems. In particular, the encoding of arbitrary classical data into quantum states usually comes at a high computational cost, either in terms of qubits or gate count. However, real-world data typically exhibits some inherent structure (such as image data) which can be leveraged to load them with a much smaller cost on a quantum computer. This work further develops an efficient algorithm for finding low-depth quantum circuits to load classical image data as quantum states. To evaluate its effectiveness, we conduct systematic studies on the MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, and Imagenette datasets. The corresponding circuits for loading the full large-scale datasets are available publicly as PennyLane datasets and can be used by the community for their own benchmarks. We further analyze the performance of various quantum classifiers, such as quantum kernel methods, parameterized quantum circuits, and tensor-network classifiers, and we compare them to convolutional neural networks. In particular, we focus on the performance of the quantum classifiers as we introduce nonlinear functions of the input state, e.g., by letting the circuit parameters depend on the input state.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03399'&gt;arXiv:2505.03399&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 06 May 2025 10:27:51 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Explaining Anomalies with Tensor Networks</title>

Recently, Aizpurua et al. demonstrated explainable anomaly detection with matrix product states on a discrete-valued cyber-security task, using quantum-inspired methods to gain insight into the learned model and detected anomalies. Here, we extend this framework to real-valued data domains. We furthermore introduce tree tensor networks for the task of explainable anomaly detection. We demonstrate these methods with three benchmark problems, show adequate predictive performance compared to several baseline models and both tensor network architectures' ability to explain anomalous samples. We thereby extend the application of tensor networks to a broader class of potential problems and open a pathway for future extensions to more complex tensor network architectures.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03911'&gt;arXiv:2505.03911&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 06 May 2025 18:35:05 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Planar fault-tolerant circuits for non-Clifford gates on the 2D color code</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05175</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Andreas Bauer, Julio C. Magdalena de la Fuente&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We introduce a family of scalable planar fault-tolerant circuits that implement logical non-Clifford operations on a 2D color code, such as a logical $T$ gate or a logical non-Pauli measurement that prepares a magic $|T\rangle$ state. The circuits are relatively simple, consisting only of physical $T$ gates, $CX$ gates, and few-qubit measurements. They can be implemented with an array of qubits on a 2D chip with nearest-neighbor couplings, and no wire crossings. The construction is based on a spacetime path integral representation of a non-Abelian 2+1D topological phase, which is related to the 3D color code. We turn the path integral into a circuit by expressing it as a spacetime $ZX$ tensor network, and then traversing it in some chosen time direction. We describe in detail how fault tolerance is achieved using a "just-in-time" decoding strategy, for which we repurpose and extend state-of-the-art color-code matching decoders.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05175'&gt;arXiv:2505.05175&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 08 May 2025 12:23:22 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional $J_1$-$J_2$ clock model: A cornucopia of emergence</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05194</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Vishnu Pulloor Kuttanikkad, Abhishodh Prakash, Rajesh Narayanan, Titas Chanda&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We present a comprehensive study on the frustrated $J_1$-$J_2$ classical $q$-state clock model with even $q&gt;4$ on a two-dimensional square lattice, revealing a rich ensemble of phases driven by competing interactions. In the unfrustrated regime ($J_1&gt;2J_2$), the model reproduces the standard clock model phenomenology: a low-temperature $\mathbb{Z}_q$-broken ferromagnet, an intermediate XY-like critical quasi-long-range-ordered (QLRO) phase with emergent $U(1)$ symmetry, and a high-temperature paramagnet. For $J_1&lt;2J_2$, frustration stabilizes five distinct regimes: the disordered paramagnet, a stripe-ordered phase breaking $\mathbb{Z}_q\times\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry, two $\mathbb{Z}_2$-broken nematic phases (one with and one without QLRO), and an exotic stripe phase with emergent discrete $\mathbb{Z}_q$ spin degrees of freedom prohibited in the microscopic Hamiltonian. Remarkably, this seemingly forbidden $\mathbb{Z}_q$ order emerges via a relevant operator in the infrared long-wavelength limit, rather than from an irrelevant perturbation, highlighting a non-standard route to emergence. Using large-scale corner transfer matrix renormalization group calculations, complemented by classical Monte Carlo simulations, we map the complete phase diagram and identify Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless, Ising, first-order, and unconventional Landau-incompatible transitions between different phases. Finally, we propose an effective field-theoretic framework that encompasses these emergent orders and their interwoven transitions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05194'&gt;arXiv:2505.05194&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 08 May 2025 12:51:59 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Asymmetric decay of quantum many-body scars in XYZ quantum spin chains</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05435</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Dhiman Bhowmick, Vir B. Bulchandani, Wen Wei Ho&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Quantum many-body scars are atypical energy eigenstates of chaotic quantum many-body systems that prevent certain special non-equilibrium initial conditions from thermalizing. We point out that quantum many-body scars exist for any nearest-neighbor spin-$S$ XYZ quantum spin chain, and arise in the form of an infinite family of highly excited yet nonentangled product-state eigenstates, which define periodic textures in spin space. This set of scars, discovered originally by Granovskii and Zhedanov in 1985, encompasses both the experimentally relevant 'spin helices' for XXZ chains and more complicated helix-like states constructed from Jacobi elliptic functions for generic XYZ chains. An appealing feature of Granovskii-Zhedanov scars is that they are well-defined in the semiclassical limit $S \to \infty$, which allows for a systematic and analytical treatment of their dynamical instability to perturbations of the Hamiltonian. Using time-dependent spin-wave theory, we predict that upon perturbing along certain directions in Hamiltonian space, Granovskii-Zhedanov scars exhibit a dramatic asymmetry in their decay: depending on the sign of the perturbation, the decrease of their contrast is either slow and linear, or fast and exponential in time. This asymmetry can be traced to the absence (presence) of imaginarity in the spectrum of the Bogoliubov Hamiltonian governing quantum fluctuations about the scar, which corresponds to the absence (presence) of a non-zero Lyapunov exponent for the limiting classical trajectory. Numerical simulations using matrix product states (MPS) and infinite time-evolving block decimation (iTEBD) confirm that our prediction remains valid even far from the semiclassical limit. Our findings challenge existing theories of how quantum-many body scars relax.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05435'&gt;arXiv:2505.05435&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 08 May 2025 17:23:34 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Quantum selection of order and dynamic properties of Kitaev-Heisenberg ferromagnet on a triangular lattice</title>

Maksimov&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Recent interest in monolayer materials motivated a search for two-dimensional ferromagnets with sizable spin-orbit coupling. Magnetic anisotropy of exchange Hamiltonian, induced by spin-orbit coupling, may not only stabilize long-range order, but also in turn can be a source of frustration and accidental degeneracy, which is the case for the Kitaev-Heisenberg model. Here we present an extensive study of ground state and excitations of ferromagnetic anisotropic-exchange Kitaev-Heisenberg model on a triangular lattice using order-by-disorder and augmented spin-wave theory calculations. It is shown that while bond-dependent terms of the model do not affect the ground state classically, quantum fluctuations select preferred magnetization direction of the ferromagnetic state and significantly alter classical phase diagram. Anisotropic terms of the magnetic Hamiltonian also give rise to magnon-magnon interactions that lead to spontaneous decay and spectral renormalization, which we illustrate using non-linear spin-wave theory.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05204'&gt;arXiv:2505.05204&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 08 May 2025 13:00:32 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>FTNILO: Explicit Multivariate Function Inversion, Optimization and Counting, Cryptography Weakness and Riemann Hypothesis Solution Equation with Tensor Networks</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05493</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Alejandro Mata Ali&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; In this paper, we present a new formalism, the Field Tensor Network Integral Logical Operator (FTNILO), to obtain the explicit equation that returns the minimum, maximum, and zeros of a multivariable injective function, and an algorithm for non-injective ones. This method extends the MeLoCoToN algorithm for inversion and optimization problems with continuous variables, by using Field Tensor Networks. The fundamentals of the method are the conversion of the problem of minimization of $N$ continuous variables into a problem of maximization of a dependent functional of a single variable. It can also be adapted to determine other properties, such as the zeros of any function. For this purpose, we use an extension of the imaginary time evolution, the new method of continuous signals, and partial or total integration, depending on the case. In addition, we show a direct way to recover both the tensor networks and the MeLoCoToN from this formalism. We show some examples of application, such as the Riemann hypothesis resolution. We provide an explicit integral equation that gives the solution of the Riemann hypothesis, being that if it results in a zero value, it is correct; otherwise, it is wrong. This algorithm requires no deep mathematical knowledge and is based on simple mathematical properties.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05493'&gt;arXiv:2505.05493&lt;/a&gt;] Published Sat, 03 May 2025 18:12:44 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

Such fractional responses are common in classical systems including the anomalous stress-strain behaviour of viscoelastic polymers, L\'evy-like contaminant transport in heterogeneous porous media, and the non-Debye dielectric relaxation of glassy dielectrics. Furthermore, these unique interactions can be implemented in current quantum information architectures, with intriguing consequences for the many-body dynamics. Using a truncated Jordan-Wigner approach, we show that in the long wavelength limit of the mean field, the dynamical critical exponent is set by the fractional order q as $z=q/2$. To probe genuine many-body dynamics, we apply matrix-product-state simulations with the time-dependent variational principle adapted to nonlocal couplings.

      <title>Towards secondary structure prediction of longer mRNA sequences using a quantum-centric optimization scheme</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05782</link>

However, the combinatorial complexity of possible foldings, especially in long sequences, poses significant computational challenges for classical algorithms. In this work, we propose a scalable, quantum-centric optimization framework that integrates quantum sampling with classical post-processing to tackle this problem. Building on a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) formulation of the mRNA folding task, we develop two complementary workflows: a Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR)-based variational quantum algorithm enhanced with gauge transformations and local search, and an Instantaneous Quantum Polynomial (IQP) circuit-based scheme where training is done classically and sampling is delegated to quantum hardware. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these approaches using IBM quantum processors, solving problem instances with up to 156 qubits and circuits containing up to 950 nonlocal gates, corresponding to mRNA sequences of up to 60 nucleotides. Additionally, we validate scalability of the CVaR algorithm on a tensor network simulator, reaching up to 354 qubits in noiseless settings. These results demonstrate the growing practical capabilities of hybrid quantum-classical methods for tackling large-scale biological optimization problems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05782'&gt;arXiv:2505.05782&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 09 May 2025 04:53:40 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

However, their density undergoes abrupt jumps because of the peculiar structure of the low temperature phase, which is only partially ordered and hosts a finite density of zero-energy domain walls. The number of linear defects between consecutive zero-energy domain walls is quantized to integer values, leading to a devil's staircase of topological origin. By contrast to the devil's staircase of the ANNNI and related models, the wave-vector is not fixed to commensurate values inside each phase.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05889'&gt;arXiv:2505.05889&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 09 May 2025 08:56:51 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>TTNOpt: Tree tensor network package for high-rank tensor compression</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05908</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Ryo Watanabe, Hidetaka Manabe, Toshiya Hikihara, Hiroshi Ueda&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We have developed TTNOpt, a software package that utilizes tree tensor networks (TTNs) for quantum spin systems and high-dimensional data analysis. TTNOpt provides efficient and powerful TTN computations by locally optimizing the network structure, guided by the entanglement pattern of the target tensors. For quantum spin systems, TTNOpt searches for the ground state of Hamiltonians with bilinear spin interactions and magnetic fields, and computes physical properties of these states, including the variational energy, bipartite entanglement entropy (EE), single-site expectation values, and two-site correlation functions. Additionally, TTNOpt can target the lowest-energy state within a specified subspace, provided that the Hamiltonian conserves total magnetization. For high-dimensional data analysis, TTNOpt factorizes complex tensors into TTN states that maximize fidelity to the original tensors by optimizing the tensors and the network. When a TTN is provided as input, TTNOpt reconstructs the network based on the EE without referencing the fidelity of the original state. We present three demonstrations of TTNOpt: (1) Ground-state search for the hierarchical chain model with a system size of $256$. The entanglement patterns of the ground state manifest themselves in a tree structure, and TTNOpt successfully identifies the tree. (2) Factorization of a quantic tensor of the $2^{24}$ dimensions representing a three-variable function where each variant has a weak bit-wise correlation.

      <title>Distributed Tensor Network Library for Quantum Computing Emulation</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06119</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Jakub Adamski, Oliver Thomson Brown&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Tensor networks offer an adaptable and efficient approach to emulation of quantum computers. Their usage relies on partitioning circuits into small tensors, which are contracted together to form the final result. While this approach intends to minimise the problem size, exceeding the locally available memory is sometimes unavoidable due to the exponential nature of quantum systems. Most HPC tensor network packages tackle this issue with a procedure called circuit slicing, which distributes the entire network onto multiple ranks, recombining it back when necessary. In this study, we present a novel alternative approach, where individual tensors are both broadcast and scattered to harness multiple levels of parallelism. The technique is abstracted behind a fixed distribution pattern, and actualised in a new portable tensor network library, QTNH, built on top of MPI and ScaLAPACK. We showcase its capabilities on ARCHER2, by emulating two well-known algorithms - the Quantum Fourier Transform and Random Circuit Sampling. This is accomplished by leveraging the implemented operations to realise various contraction strategies, including a unique distributed MPS tensor factorisation approach. We thus demonstrate that our library can be used to advance the accuracy of quantum emulation, while offering a simple and flexible interface to tensor distribution.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06119'&gt;arXiv:2505.06119&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 09 May 2025 15:17:42 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>2D Quon Language: Unifying Framework for Cliffords, Matchgates, and Beyond</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06336</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Byungmin Kang, Chen Zhao, Zhengwei Liu, Xun Gao, Soonwon Choi&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Simulating generic quantum states and dynamics is practically intractable using classical computers. However, certain special classes -- namely Clifford and matchgate circuits -- permit efficient computation. They provide invaluable tools for studying many-body physics, quantum chemistry, and quantum computation. While both play foundational roles across multiple disciplines, the origins of their tractability seem disparate, and their relationship remain unclear. A deeper understanding of such tractable classes could expand their scope and enable a wide range of new applications. In this work, we make progress toward the unified understanding of the Clifford and matchgate -- these two classes are, in fact, distinct special cases of a single underlying structure. Specifically, we introduce the 2D Quon language, which combines Majorana worldlines with their underlying spacetime topology to diagrammatically represent quantum processes and tensor networks. In full generality, the 2D Quon language is universal -- capable of representing arbitrary quantum states, dynamics, or tensor networks -- yet they become especially powerful in describing Clifford and matchgate classes. Each class can be efficiently characterized in a visually recognizable manner using the Quon framework. This capability naturally gives rise to several families of efficiently computable tensor networks introduced in this work: punctured matchgates, hybrid Clifford-matchgate-MPS, and ansatze generated from factories of tractable networks. All of these exhibit high non-Cliffordness, high non-matchgateness, and large bipartite entanglement entropy. We discuss a range of applications of our approach, from recovering well-known results such as the Kramers-Wannier duality and the star-triangle relation of the Ising model, to enabling variational optimization with novel ansatz states.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06336'&gt;arXiv:2505.06336&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 09 May 2025 18:00:00 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Emergent magnetism and spin liquids in an extended Hubbard description of moiré bilayers</title>

Seifert, Leon Balents, Hong-Chen Jiang&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Motivated by twisted transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), we study an extended Hubbard model with both on-site and off-site repulsive interactions, in which Mott insulating states with concomitant charge order occur at fractional fillings. To resolve the charge ordering as well as the fate of the local moments formed thereby, we perform large-scale density matrix renormalization group calculations on cylindrical geometries for several filling fractions and ranges of interaction strength. Depending on the precise parameter regime, both antiferromagnetically ordered as well as quantum-disordered states are found, with a particularly prominent example being a quantum spin liquid-type ground state on top of charge-ordering with effective Kagom\'e geometry. We discuss the different mechanisms at play in stabilizing various electronic and magnetic states. The results suggest that moir\'e TMDs are a promising venue for emergent quantum magnetism of strongly interacting electrons.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06339'&gt;arXiv:2505.06339&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 09 May 2025 18:00:00 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Fractional Chern Insulators and Competing States in a Twisted MoTe$_2$ Lattice Model</title>

Parameswaran&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We construct an interacting lattice model for twisted $\mathrm{MoTe}_{2}$ bilayers at a twist angle of approximately 3.7\degree. We use the infinite density matrix renormalization group (iDMRG) in a cylinder geometry to identify a variety of competing integer and fractional Chern insulators and charge density wave (CDW) states that emerge upon the spontaneous breaking of time reversal symmetry by valley polarization. We use finite-size analysis to establish the robustness of Chern insulating states even in geometries that admit competing CDWs, and explore the phase transitions between these states driven by increasing sublattice potential or interaction strength. Our work highlights the crucial role played by direct spin exchange in stabilizing the parent valley-polarized Chern ferromagnet band, and by the mixing with higher bands in destabilizing CIs/FCIs in favor of CDW orders.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06354'&gt;arXiv:2505.06354&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 09 May 2025 18:01:11 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Initialization and training of matrix product state probabilistic models</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06419</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Xun Tang, Yuehaw Khoo, Lexing Ying&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Modeling probability distributions via the wave function of a quantum state is central to quantum-inspired generative modeling and quantum state tomography (QST). We investigate a common failure mode in training randomly initialized matrix product states (MPS) using gradient descent. The results show that the trained MPS models do not accurately predict the strong interactions between boundary sites in periodic spin chain models. In the case of the Born machine algorithm, we further identify a causality trap, where the trained MPS models resemble causal models that ignore the non-local correlations in the true distribution. We propose two complementary strategies to overcome the training failure -- one through optimization and one through initialization. First, we develop a natural gradient descent (NGD) method, which approximately simulates the gradient flow on tensor manifolds and significantly enhances training efficiency. Numerical experiments show that NGD avoids local minima in both Born machines and in general MPS tomography. Remarkably, we show that NGD with line search can converge to the global minimum in only a few iterations. Second, for the BM algorithm, we introduce a warm-start initialization based on the TTNS-Sketch algorithm. We show that gradient descent under a warm initialization does not encounter the causality trap and admits rapid convergence to the ground truth.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06419'&gt;arXiv:2505.06419&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 09 May 2025 20:39:25 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Matti Raasakka&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We formulate quantum field theory in triangulated spacetime using compositional quantum field theory and tensor network methods. We show that gravitational interactions emerge as a low-energy effective phenomenon in this framework. For concrete calculations we use free massive scalar field theory in two-dimensional Lorentzian spacetime, but the results generalize to other models and higher dimensions. Finally, our results lead us to propose a new approach to the unification of quantum field theory with gravity, the QFT vector model, which combines insights and techniques from various current approaches to quantum gravity such as causal dynamical triangulations, random tensor models, group field theory, emergent gravity and holography.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07102'&gt;arXiv:2505.07102&lt;/a&gt;] Published Sun, 11 May 2025 19:44:08 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

We investigate the utility of Tree Tensor Network (TTN) states to solve the dynamics of the quantum Ising model in two dimensions. Within the perturbative regime of small transverse fields, TTNs faithfully reproduce analytically known, but non-trivial and physically interesting results, for lattices up to $16 \times 16$ sites. Limitations of the method related to the rapid growth of entanglement entropy are explored within more general, paradigmatic quench settings. We provide and discuss comprehensive benchmarks regarding the benefit of \emph{GPU} acceleration and the impact of using local operator sums on the performance.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07612'&gt;arXiv:2505.07612&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 12 May 2025 14:34:28 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Mixed state deep thermalization</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07795</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Xie-Hang Yu, Wen Wei Ho, Pavel Kos&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We introduce the notion of the mixed state projected ensemble (MSPE), a collection of mixed states describing a local region of a quantum many-body system, conditioned upon measurements of the complementary region which are incomplete. This constitutes a generalization of the pure state projected ensemble in which measurements are assumed ideal and complete, and which has been shown to tend towards limiting pure state distributions depending only on symmetries of the system, thus representing a new kind of universality in quantum equilibration dubbed deep thermalization. We study the MSPE generated by solvable (1+1)d dual-unitary quantum circuit evolution, and identify the limiting mixed state distributions which emerge at late times depending on the size of the incomplete measurement, which we assume to be lossy, finding that they correspond to certain random density matrix ensembles known in the literature. We also derive the rate of the emergence of such universality. Furthermore, we investigate the quantum information properties of the states composing the ensemble, specifically their capacity to teleport quantum information between the ends of the system. The teleportation fidelity is upper bounded by the quantum conditional entropy, which we find exhibits a sharp transition from zero to maximal when the number of measurements lost matches of that the number of degrees of freedom to be teleported. Our results initiate the first investigation of deep thermalization for mixed state ensembles, which are relevant for present-day quantum simulation experiments wherein measurements are typically not perfect, and also amount to a physical and natural way of sampling from hitherto abstract random density matrix ensembles.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07795'&gt;arXiv:2505.07795&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 12 May 2025 17:45:24 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Quon Classical Simulation: Unifying Cliffords, Matchgates and Entanglement</title>

Within this framework, we establish the Quon Classical Simulation (QCS) for hybrid Clifford-Matchgate circuits, which is efficient for both Clifford circuits and Matchgate circuits, therefore answering a long standing open question on unifying efficient classical simulations. This framework is built upon the Quon language, a 2+1D topological quantum field theory with space-time boundary and defects. Its exponential computation complexity is captured by Magic holes, a topological feature capturing the global long-range entanglement. Both Clifford circuits and Matchgate circuits are free of Magic holes. Efficient classical simulations of Cliffords and Matchgates are implemented by two parallel operations, generalized surgery theory of 3-manifolds and Yang-Baxter relations on the 2D boundary respectively, with additional binary arithmetic properties.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07804'&gt;arXiv:2505.07804&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 12 May 2025 17:53:05 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Evidence that the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm Optimizes the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick Model Efficiently in the Average Case</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07929</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Sami Boulebnane, Abid Khan, Minzhao Liu, Jeffrey Larson, Dylan Herman, Ruslan Shaydulin, Marco Pistoia&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SK) model serves as a foundational framework for understanding disordered systems. The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is a quantum optimization algorithm whose performance monotonically improves with its depth $p$. We analyze QAOA applied to the SK model in the infinite-size limit and provide numerical evidence that it obtains a $(1-\epsilon)$ approximation to the optimal energy with circuit depth $\mathcal{O}(n/\epsilon^{1.13})$ in the average case. Our results are enabled by mapping the task of evaluating QAOA energy onto the task of simulating a spin-boson system, which we perform with modest cost using matrix product states. We optimize QAOA parameters and observe that QAOA achieves $\varepsilon\lesssim2.2\%$ at $p=160$ in the infinite-size limit. We then use these optimized QAOA parameters to evaluate the QAOA energy for finite-sized instances with up to $30$ qubits and find convergence to the ground state consistent with the infinite-size limit prediction. Our results provide strong numerical evidence that QAOA can efficiently approximate the ground state of the SK model in the average case.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07929'&gt;arXiv:2505.07929&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 12 May 2025 18:00:01 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

We argue that the phase competition is captured by an effective interaction range, which depends on both the bare interaction range and quantum geometric properties. We argue that short effective interaction ranges stabilize fractional states while longer-range interactions favor charge-ordered states. To confirm our hypothesis, we conduct a numerical study of the generalized Hofstadter model using the density matrix renormalization group. Our theory offers a new interpretation of the geometric stability hypothesis and generalizes it, providing a unifying framework for several approaches to fractional phase stabilization. Finally, we propose a route towards experimental verification of the theory and possible implications for fractional states in bands with higher Chern numbers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07950'&gt;arXiv:2505.07950&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 12 May 2025 18:00:11 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08226</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Ihor Sokolov, Jacek Dziarmaga&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; A bang-bang (BB) algorithm prepares the ground state of a lattice quantum many-body Hamiltonian $H=H_1+H_2$ by evolving an initial product state alternating between $H_1$ and $H_2$. We optimize the algorithm with tensor networks in one and two dimensions. The optimization has two stages. In stage one, a shallow translationally-invariant circuit is optimized in an infinite lattice. In stage two, the infinite-lattice gate sequence is used as a starting point for a finite lattice where it remains optimal in the bulk. The prepared state requires optimization only at its boundary, within a healing length from lattice edges, and the gate sequence needs to be modified only within the causal cone of the boundary. We test the procedure in the 1D and 2D quantum Ising model near its quantum critical point employing, respectively, the matrix product state (MPS) and the pair-entangled projected state (PEPS). At the boundary already the infinite-lattice sequence turns out to provide a more accurate state than in the bulk.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08226'&gt;arXiv:2505.08226&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 13 May 2025 05:01:49 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Distributed Quantum Neural Networks on Distributed Photonic Quantum Computing</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08474</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Kuan-Cheng Chen, Chen-Yu Liu, Yu Shang, Felix Burt, Kin K. Leung&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We introduce a distributed quantum-classical framework that synergizes photonic quantum neural networks (QNNs) with matrix-product-state (MPS) mapping to achieve parameter-efficient training of classical neural networks. By leveraging universal linear-optical decompositions of $M$-mode interferometers and photon-counting measurement statistics, our architecture generates neural parameters through a hybrid quantum-classical workflow: photonic QNNs with $M(M+1)/2$ trainable parameters produce high-dimensional probability distributions that are mapped to classical network weights via an MPS model with bond dimension $\chi$. Empirical validation on MNIST classification demonstrates that photonic QT achieves an accuracy of $95.50\% \pm 0.84\%$ using 3,292 parameters ($\chi = 10$), compared to $96.89\% \pm 0.31\%$ for classical baselines with 6,690 parameters. Moreover, a ten-fold compression ratio is achieved at $\chi = 4$, with a relative accuracy loss of less than $3\%$. The framework outperforms classical compression techniques (weight sharing/pruning) by 6--12\% absolute accuracy while eliminating quantum hardware requirements during inference through classical deployment of compressed parameters. Simulations incorporating realistic photonic noise demonstrate the framework's robustness to near-term hardware imperfections. Ablation studies confirm quantum necessity: replacing photonic QNNs with random inputs collapses accuracy to chance level ($10.0\% \pm 0.5\%$). Photonic quantum computing's room-temperature operation, inherent scalability through spatial-mode multiplexing, and HPC-integrated architecture establish a practical pathway for distributed quantum machine learning, combining the expressivity of photonic Hilbert spaces with the deployability of classical neural networks.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08474'&gt;arXiv:2505.08474&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 13 May 2025 11:58:45 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Augmenting Density Matrix Renormalization Group with Matchgates and Clifford circuits</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08635</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Jiale Huang, Xiangjian Qian, Zhendong Li, Mingpu Qin&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Matchgates and Clifford circuits are two types of quantum circuits which can be efficiently simulated classically, though the underlying reasons are quite different. Matchgates are essentially the single particle basis transformations in the Majorana fermion representation which can be easily handled classically, while the Clifford circuits can be efficiently simulated using the tableau method according to the Gottesman-Knill theorem. In this work, we propose a new wave-function ansatz in which matrix product states are augmented with the combination of Matchgates and Clifford circuits (dubbed MCA-MPS) to take advantage of the representing power of all of them. Moreover, the optimization of MCA-MPS can be efficiently implemented within the Density Matrix Renormalization Group method. Our benchmark results on one-dimensional hydrogen chain show that MCA-MPS can improve the accuracy of the ground-state calculation by several orders of magnitude over MPS with the same bond dimension. This new method provides us a useful approach to study quantum many-body systems. The MCA-MPS ansatz also expands our understanding of classically simulatable quantum many-body states.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08635'&gt;arXiv:2505.08635&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 13 May 2025 14:53:09 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Quantized six-vertex model on a torus</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Rei Inoue, Atsuo Kuniba, Yuji Terashima, Junya Yagi&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We study the integrability of the quantized six-vertex model with four parameters on a torus. It is a three-dimensional integrable lattice model in which a layer transfer matrix, depending on two spectral parameters associated with the homology cycles of the torus, can be defined not only on the square lattice but also on more general graphs. For a class of graphs that we call admissible, we establish the commutativity of the layer transfer matrices by introducing four types of tetrahedron equations and two types of inversion relations. Expanding in the spectral parameters yields a family of commuting quantum Hamiltonians. The quantized six-vertex model can also be reformulated in terms of (quantized) dimer models, and encompasses known integrable systems as special cases, including the free parafermion model and the relativistic Toda chain.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08924'&gt;arXiv:2505.08924&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 13 May 2025 19:43:33 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>One-dimensional extended Hubbard model coupled with an optical cavity</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Taiga Nakamoto, Kazuaki Takasan, Naoto Tsuji&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We study the one-dimensional extended Hubbard model coupled with an optical cavity, which describes an interplay of the effect of vacuum fluctuation of light and the quantum phase transition between the charge- and spin-density-wave phases. The ground state and excitation spectrum of the model are calculated by numerically exact tensor-network methods. We find that the photon number of the ground state is enhanced (suppressed) along the quantum phase transition line when the light-matter coupling is comparable to (much smaller than) the cavity frequency. We also show that the exciton peak in the optical conductivity and photon spectrum that exists without the cavity exhibits the vacuum Rabi splitting at resonance due to the light-matter interaction. This behavior is in contrast to the case without excitons, where the photon spectrum is merely broadened without splitting due to the lack of a sharp resonance.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09311'&gt;arXiv:2505.09311&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 14 May 2025 11:57:34 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>TensorRL-QAS: Reinforcement learning with tensor networks for scalable quantum architecture search</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09371</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Akash Kundu, Stefano Mangini&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Variational quantum algorithms hold the promise to address meaningful quantum problems already on noisy intermediate-scale quantum hardware, but they face the challenge of designing quantum circuits that both solve the target problem and comply with device limitations. Quantum architecture search (QAS) automates this design process, with reinforcement learning (RL) emerging as a promising approach. Yet, RL-based QAS methods encounter significant scalability issues, as computational and training costs grow rapidly with the number of qubits, circuit depth, and noise, severely impacting performance. To address these challenges, we introduce $\textit{TensorRL-QAS}$, a scalable framework that combines tensor network (TN) methods with RL for designing quantum circuits. By warm-starting the architecture search with a matrix product state approximation of the target solution, TensorRL-QAS effectively narrows the search space to physically meaningful circuits, accelerating convergence to the desired solution. Tested on several quantum chemistry problems of up to 12-qubit, TensorRL-QAS achieves up to a 10-fold reduction in CNOT count and circuit depth compared to baseline methods, while maintaining or surpassing chemical accuracy. It reduces function evaluations by up to 100-fold, accelerates training episodes by up to $98\%$, and achieves up to $50\%$ success probability for 10-qubit systems-far exceeding the $&lt;1\%$ rates of baseline approaches. Robustness and versatility are demonstrated both in the noiseless and noisy scenarios, where we report a simulation of up to 8-qubit. These advancements establish TensorRL-QAS as a promising candidate for a scalable and efficient quantum circuit discovery protocol on near-term quantum hardware.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09371'&gt;arXiv:2505.09371&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 14 May 2025 13:23:34 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Vortex and fractional quantum Hall phases in a rotating anisotropic Bose gas</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09452</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Umut Tanyeri, Ahmed Kallushi, Rıfat Onur Umucalılar, Ahmet Keleş&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Realizing fractional quantum Hall (FQH) states in ultracold atomic systems remains a major goal despite numerous experimental advances in the last few decades. Recent progress in trap anisotropy control under rapid rotation has renewed interest in ultracold atomic FQH physics, enabling experiments that impart much larger angular momentum per particle and offer in-situ imaging with resolution finer than the cyclotron orbit size. In this paper, we present a theoretical investigation of a rapidly rotating anisotropic Bose gas. By projecting the full Hamiltonian, including both kinetic and interaction terms, onto the lowest Landau level, we derive a compact two-parameter model that captures the effects of interaction strength, rotation rate, and anisotropy. Using exact diagonalization and density matrix renormalization group, we obtain a phase diagram that features broken-symmetry phases and topologically ordered quantum Hall states, while also highlighting the distinctive physics arising from the system's edges. Our results demonstrate the potential for future theoretical and experimental exploration of anisotropic quantum fluids, offering a unified framework for weakly interacting Bose condensates, vortex matter, and strongly correlated topological phases.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09452'&gt;arXiv:2505.09452&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 14 May 2025 15:03:21 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Unveiling Connections between Tensor Network and Stabilizer Formalism by Cutting in Time</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09512</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Zhong-Xia Shang, Si-Yuan Chen, Wenjun Yu, Qi Zhao&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Tensor network and stabilizer formalism are two main approaches for classical simulations of quantum systems. In this work, we explore their connections from a quantum resource perspective on simulating $UOU^\dag$ with $O$ an arbitrary operator ranging from pure state density matrices to Pauli operators. For the tensor network approach, we show that its complexity, quantified by entanglement, is governed by the interplay of two other types of quantum resources, coherence and magic. Crucially, which one has the predominant influence on entanglement is elucidated by what we term the time entanglement of $O$. As time entanglement increases, the dominant resource shifts from coherence to magic. Numerical experiments are conducted to support this claim. For the stabilizer formalism approach, we propose an operator stabilizer formalism to enable its application to arbitrary $O$, whose complexity always relies on magic. The operator stabilizer formalism is also powerful than the standard one for simulating some quantum circuits with special structures. Therefore, as the time entanglement increases, the governing resources between the two approaches change from being uncorrelated to highly correlated.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09512'&gt;arXiv:2505.09512&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 14 May 2025 16:03:18 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Overcoming the entanglement barrier with sampled tensor networks</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09714</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Stefano Carignano, Guglielmo Lami, Jacopo De Nardis, Luca Tagliacozzo&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The rapid growth of entanglement under unitary time evolution is the primary bottleneck for modern tensor-network techniques--such as Matrix Product States (MPS)--when computing time-dependent expectation values. This {entanglement barrier} restricts classical simulations and, conversely, underpins the quantum advantage anticipated from future devices. Here we show that, for one-dimensional Hamiltonian dynamics, the spatio-temporal tensor network encoding the evolved wave function amplitudes can be contracted efficiently along the left-right (spatial) direction. Exploiting this structure, we develop a hybrid Tensor-Network/Monte-Carlo (TN-MC) algorithm that samples the wave function and evaluates expectation values of generic local operators with computational cost that scales only polynomially in time. The accurate contraction of the wave function amplitudes is a consequence of the favorable scaling with time of the generalised temporal entropies. We find that their real part either saturates or, at most, grows logarithmically with time, revealing new instances of continuous dynamical quantum phase transitions (DQPTs) which we characterize. Our results therefore show that, when computing expectation values of local operators, the entanglement barrier in one-dimensional Hamiltonian evolution can be bypassed with a TN-MC blend.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09714'&gt;arXiv:2505.09714&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 14 May 2025 18:14:47 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

Kind, Benedikt Fauseweh&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Recent advances in analog and digital quantum-simulation platforms have enabled exploration of the spectrum of entanglement Hamiltonians via variational algorithms. In this work we analyze the convergence properties of the variationally obtained solutions and compare them to numerically exact calculations in quantum critical systems. We demonstrate that interpreting the cost functional as an integral permits the deployment of iterative quadrature schemes, thereby reducing the required number of measurements by several orders of magnitude. We further show that a modified ansatz captures deviations from the Bisognano-Wichmann form in lattice models, improves convergence, and provides a cost-function-level diagnostic for quantum phase transitions. Finally, we establish that a low cost value does not by itself guarantee convergence in trace distance. Nevertheless, it faithfully reproduces degeneracies and spectral gaps, which are essential for applications to topological phases.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10530'&gt;arXiv:2505.10530&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 15 May 2025 17:41:14 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Distributed Realization of Color Codes for Quantum Error Correction</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10693</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Nitish Kumar Chandra, David Tipper, Reza Nejabati, Eneet Kaur, Kaushik P. Seshadreesan&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Color codes are a leading class of topological quantum error-correcting codes with modest error thresholds and structural compatibility with two-dimensional architectures, which make them well-suited for fault-tolerant quantum computing (FTQC). Here, we propose and analyze a distributed architecture for realizing the (6.6.6) color code. The architecture involves interconnecting patches of the color code housed in different quantum processing units (QPUs) via entangled pairs. To account for noisy interconnects, we model the qubits in the color code as being subject to a bit-flip noise channel, where the qubits on the boundary (seam) between patches experience elevated noise compared to those in the bulk. We investigate the error threshold of the distributed color code under such asymmetric noise conditions by employing two decoders: a tensor-network-based decoder and a recently introduced concatenated Minimum Weight Perfect Matching (MWPM) algorithm. Our simulations demonstrate that elevated noise on seam qubits leads to a slight reduction in threshold for the tensor-network decoder, whereas the concatenated MWPM decoder shows no significant change in the error threshold, underscoring its effectiveness under asymmetric noise conditions. Our findings thus highlight the robustness of color codes in distributed architectures and provide valuable insights into the practical realization of FTQC involving noisy interconnects between QPUs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10693'&gt;arXiv:2505.10693&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 15 May 2025 20:33:00 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Quantum data generation in a denoising model with multiscale entanglement renormalization network</title>

The technological revolution of machine learning represented by generative models heralds a great prospect of artificial intelligence, and the huge amount of data processes poses a big challenge to existing computers. The generation of large quantities of quantum data will be a challenge for quantum artificial intelligence. In this work, we present an efficient noise-resistant quantum data generation method that can be applied to various types of NISQ quantum processors, where the target quantum data belongs to a certain class and our proposal enables the generation of various quantum data belonging to the target class. Specifically, we propose a quantum denoising probability model (QDM) based on a multiscale entanglement renormalization network (MERA) for the generation of quantum data. To show the feasibility and practicality of our scheme, we demonstrate the generations of the classes of GHZ-like states and W-like states with a success rate above 99%. Our MREA QDM can also be used to denoise multiple types of quantum data simultaneously. We show the success rate of denoising both GHZ-like and W-like states with a single qubit noise environment of noise level within 1/4 can approximate to be 100%, and with two other types of noise environment with noise level within 1/4 can be above 90%. Our quantum data generation scheme provides new ideas and prospects for quantum generative models in the NISQ era.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10796'&gt;arXiv:2505.10796&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 16 May 2025 02:18:01 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

Claeys, Tomaž Prosen&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Recent years have seen significant advances, both theoretical and experimental, in our understanding of quantum many-body dynamics. Given this problem's high complexity, it is surprising that a substantial amount of this progress can be ascribed to exact analytical results. Here we review dual-unitary circuits as a particular setting leading to exact results in quantum many-body dynamics. Dual-unitary circuits constitute minimal models in which space and time are treated on an equal footings, yielding exactly solvable yet possibly chaotic evolution. They were the first in which current notions of quantum chaos could be analytically quantified, allow for a full characterisation of the dynamics of thermalisation, scrambling, and entanglement (among others), and can be experimentally realised in current quantum simulators. Dual-unitarity is a specific fruitful implementation of the more general idea of space-time duality in which the roles of space and time are exchanged to access relevant dynamical properties of quantum many-body systems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11489'&gt;arXiv:2505.11489&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 16 May 2025 17:52:54 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

Conventional DMRG and MPS methods frequently encounter limitations when dealing with subtle quantum correlations and entanglement structures near critical points, avoided crossings, and topologically ordered phases. By integrating the dynamical Uhlmann gauge potential and its categorical extensions into the numerical optimization and truncation procedures, our approach substantially improves coherence stability and accuracy. Through illustrative applications in quantum chemistry, condensed matter physics, and quantum dynamics, we demonstrate significant enhancements in precision and reliability, underscoring the broad potential of Uhlmann gauge-enhanced computational methods.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11514'&gt;arXiv:2505.11514&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 05 May 2025 03:26:07 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Independent Set Enumeration in King Graphs by Tensor Network Contractions</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12776</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Kai Liang&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; This paper discusses the enumeration of independent sets in king graphs of size $m \times n$, based on the tensor network contractions algorithm given in reference~\cite{tilEnum}. We transform the problem into Wang tiling enumeration within an $(m+1) \times (n+1)$ rectangle and compute the results for all cases where $m + n \leq 79$ using tensor network contraction algorithm, and provided an approximation for larger $m, n$. Using the same algorithm, we also enumerated independent sets with vertex number restrictions. Based on the results, we analyzed the vertex number that maximize the enumeration for each pair $(m, n)$. Additionally, we compute the corresponding weighted enumeration, where each independent set is weighted by the number of its vertices (i.e., the total sum of vertices over all independent sets). The approximations for larger $m, n$ are given as well. Our results have added thousands of new items to the OEIS sequences A089980 and A193580. In addition, the combinatorial problems above are closely related to the hard-core model in physics. We estimate some important constants based on the existing results, and the relative error between our estimation of the entropy constant and the existing results is less than $10^{-9}$.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12776'&gt;arXiv:2505.12776&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 19 May 2025 07:04:14 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Verifying Quantum Memory in the Dynamics of Spin Boson Models</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Charlotte Bäcker, Valentin Link, Walter T. Strunz&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We investigate the nature of memory effects in the non-Markovian dynamics of spin boson models. Local quantum memory criteria can be used to indicate that the reduced dynamics of an open system necessarily requires a quantum memory in its environment. We apply two such criteria, derived from different definitions put forward in the literature, to spin boson and two-spin boson models. For the computation of dynamical maps and process tensors, we employ a numerically exact method for non-Markovian open system dynamics based on matrix product operator influence functionals, that can be applied across broad parameter regimes. We find that, with access to single-intervention process tensors, one can generally predict quantum memory in the dynamics at low temperatures. Given instead only the dynamical map, we are still able to detect quantum memory in the case of resonant environments at short evolution times. Moreover, we confirm quantum memory in the stationary dynamical regime using process tensors with the correlated steady state of system and environment as initial condition.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13067'&gt;arXiv:2505.13067&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 19 May 2025 13:02:41 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Multireference Embedding and Fragmentation Methods for Classical and Quantum Computers: from Model Systems to Realistic Applications</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13394</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Shreya Verma, Abhishek Mitra, Qiaohong Wang, Ruhee D'Cunha, Bhavnesh Jangid, Matthew R. Hennefarth, Valay Agarawal, Leon Otis, Soumi Haldar, Matthew R. Hermes, Laura Gagliardi&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; One of the primary challenges in quantum chemistry is the accurate modeling of strong electron correlation. While multireference methods effectively capture such correlation, their steep scaling with system size prohibits their application to large molecules and extended materials. Quantum embedding offers a promising solution by partitioning complex systems into manageable subsystems. In this review, we highlight recent advances in multireference density matrix embedding and localized active space self-consistent field approaches for complex molecules and extended materials. We discuss both classical implementations and the emerging potential of these methods on quantum computers. By extending classical embedding concepts to the quantum landscape, these algorithms have the potential to expand the reach of multireference methods in quantum chemistry and materials.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13394'&gt;arXiv:2505.13394&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 19 May 2025 17:33:53 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Saten: Sparse Augmented Tensor Networks for Post-Training Compression of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14871</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Ryan Solgi, Kai Zhen, Rupak Vignesh Swaminathan, Nathan Susanj, Athanasios Mouchtaris, Siegfried Kunzmann, Zheng Zhang&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The efficient implementation of large language models (LLMs) is crucial for deployment on resource-constrained devices. Low-rank tensor compression techniques, such as tensor-train (TT) networks, have been widely studied for over-parameterized neural networks. However, their applications to compress pre-trained large language models (LLMs) for downstream tasks (post-training) remains challenging due to the high-rank nature of pre-trained LLMs and the lack of access to pretraining data. In this study, we investigate low-rank tensorized LLMs during fine-tuning and propose sparse augmented tensor networks (Saten) to enhance their performance. The proposed Saten framework enables full model compression. Experimental results demonstrate that Saten enhances both accuracy and compression efficiency in tensorized language models, achieving state-of-the-art performance.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14871'&gt;arXiv:2505.14871&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 20 May 2025 20:01:54 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Controlling quantum phases with electric fields in one-dimensional Hubbard systems</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; D. Arisa, R. M. Dos Santos, Isaac M. Carvalho, Vivian V. França&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Quantum systems under electric fields provide a powerful framework for uncovering and controlling novel quantum phases, especially in low-dimensional systems with strong correlations. In this work, we investigate quantum phase transitions induced by an electric potential difference in a one-dimensional half-filled Hubbard chain. By analyzing (i) tunneling and pairing mechanisms, (ii) charge and spin gaps, and (iii) entanglement between the chain halves, we identify three distinct phases: Mott insulator, metal and band-like insulator. The metallic regime, characterized by the closing of both charge and spin gaps, is accompanied by a field-dependent kinetic energy and a quasi-periodic oscillatory behavior of pairing response and entanglement. Although the metallic phase persists for different magnetizations, its extent in the phase diagram shrinks as spin polarization increases.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15449'&gt;arXiv:2505.15449&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 21 May 2025 12:31:00 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Inchworm tensor train hybridization expansion quantum impurity solver</title>

Traditional methods often fall short of producing accurate results for multi-orbital systems with complex interactions and off-diagonal hybridizations. Recently, tensor-train-based integration and summation techniques have shown promise as effective alternatives. In this study, we use tensor train methods to tackle quantum impurity problems formulated within the imaginary-time inchworm hybridization expansion framework. We identify key challenges in the inchworm expansion itself and its interplay with tensor-train-based methods. We demonstrate the accuracy and versatility of our approach by solving general quantum impurity problems. Our results suggest that tensor-train decomposition schemes offer a viable path toward accurate and efficient multi-orbital impurity solvers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16117'&gt;arXiv:2505.16117&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 22 May 2025 01:51:03 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Prethermalization, shadowing breakdown, and the absence of Trotterization transition in quantum circuits</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15521</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Marko Znidaric&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; One of premier utilities of present day noisy quantum computers is simulation of many-body quantum systems. We study how long in time is such a discrete-time simulation representative of a continuous time Hamiltonian evolution, namely, a finite time-step introduces so-called Trotterization errors. We show that the truncated operator propagator (Ruelle-Pollicott resonances) is a powerful tool to that end, as well as to study prethermalization and discrete time crystals, including finding those phenomena at large gate duration, and can be used to calculate diffusion constant. We show that the effective energy is more stable than suggested by Trotter errors -- a manifestation of prethermalization -- while all other observables are not. Even such the most stable observable though deteriorates in the thermodynamic limit. Different than in classical systems with the strongest chaos, where the faithfulness time (the shadowing time) can be infinite, in quantum many-body chaotic systems it is finite. A corollary of our results is also that, opposite to previous claims, there is no Trotterization transition in non-integrable many-body quantum systems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15521'&gt;arXiv:2505.15521&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 21 May 2025 13:46:39 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Boosting Binomial Exotic Option Pricing with Tensor Networks</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17033</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Maarten van Damme, Rishi Sreedhar, Martin Ganahl&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Pricing of exotic financial derivatives, such as Asian and multi-asset American basket options, poses significant challenges for standard numerical methods such as binomial trees or Monte Carlo methods. While the former often scales exponentially with the parameters of interest, the latter often requires expensive simulations to obtain sufficient statistical convergence. This work combines the binomial pricing method for options with tensor network techniques, specifically Matrix Product States (MPS), to overcome these challenges. Our proposed methods scale linearly with the parameters of interest and significantly reduce the computational complexity of pricing exotics compared to conventional methods. For Asian options, we present two methods: a tensor train cross approximation-based method for pricing, and a variational pricing method using MPS, which provides a stringent lower bound on option prices. For multi-asset American basket options, we combine the decoupled trees technique with the tensor train cross approximation to efficiently handle baskets of up to $m = 8$ correlated assets. All approaches scale linearly in the number of discretization steps $N$ for Asian options, and the number of assets $m$ for multi-asset options. Our numerical experiments underscore the high potential of tensor network methods as highly efficient simulation and optimization tools for financial engineering.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17033'&gt;arXiv:2505.17033&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 07 May 2025 18:01:13 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Fast and Flexible Quantum-Inspired Differential Equation Solvers with Data Integration</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Lucas Arenstein, Martin Mikkelsen, Michael Kastoryano&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Accurately solving high-dimensional partial differential equations (PDEs) remains a central challenge in computational mathematics. Traditional numerical methods, while effective in low-dimensional settings or on coarse grids, often struggle to deliver the precision required in practical applications. Recent machine learning-based approaches offer flexibility but frequently fall short in terms of accuracy and reliability, particularly in industrial contexts. In this work, we explore a quantum-inspired method based on quantized tensor trains (QTT), enabling efficient and accurate solutions to PDEs in a variety of challenging scenarios. Through several representative examples, we demonstrate that the QTT approach can achieve logarithmic scaling in both memory and computational cost for linear and nonlinear PDEs. Additionally, we introduce a novel technique for data-driven learning within the quantum-inspired framework, combining the adaptability of neural networks with enhanced accuracy and reduced training time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17046'&gt;arXiv:2505.17046&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 15 May 2025 12:38:47 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>A tensor network approach for chaotic time series prediction</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17740</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Rodrigo Martínez-Peña, Román Orús&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Making accurate predictions of chaotic time series is a complex challenge. Reservoir computing, a neuromorphic-inspired approach, has emerged as a powerful tool for this task. It exploits the memory and nonlinearity of dynamical systems without requiring extensive parameter tuning. However, selecting and optimizing reservoir architectures remains an open problem. Next-generation reservoir computing simplifies this problem by employing nonlinear vector autoregression based on truncated Volterra series, thereby reducing hyperparameter complexity. Nevertheless, the latter suffers from exponential parameter growth in terms of the maximum monomial degree. Tensor networks offer a promising solution to this issue by decomposing multidimensional arrays into low-dimensional structures, thus mitigating the curse of dimensionality. This paper explores the application of a previously proposed tensor network model for predicting chaotic time series, demonstrating its advantages in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency compared to conventional echo state networks. Using a state-of-the-art tensor network approach enables us to bridge the gap between the tensor network and reservoir computing communities, fostering advances in both fields.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17740'&gt;arXiv:2505.17740&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 23 May 2025 11:03:35 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Matrix-product-state approach for qubits-waveguide systems in real space</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Shimpei Goto&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We present a matrix-product-state-based numerical approach for simulating systems composed of several qubits and a common one-dimensional waveguide. In the presented approach, the one-dimensional waveguide is modeled in real space. Thus, one can use the advantage of matrix-product states that are suited for simulating low-entangled one-dimensional systems. The price to pay is that the vacuum of the waveguide in this modeling becomes the Bogoliubov vacuum, and one has to consider a not-so-small local Hilbert space for bosonic degrees of freedom. To manage the large local Hilbert space, we adopt the recently proposed single-site schemes. We demonstrate the potential of the presented approach by simulating superradiant phenomena within the Hamiltonian dynamics.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19424'&gt;arXiv:2505.19424&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 26 May 2025 02:31:58 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Tensorization is a powerful but underexplored tool for compression and interpretability of neural networks</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20132</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Safa Hamreras, Sukhbinder Singh, Román Orús&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Tensorizing a neural network involves reshaping some or all of its dense weight matrices into higher-order tensors and approximating them using low-rank tensor network decompositions. This technique has shown promise as a model compression strategy for large-scale neural networks. However, despite encouraging empirical results, tensorized neural networks (TNNs) remain underutilized in mainstream deep learning. In this position paper, we offer a perspective on both the potential and current limitations of TNNs. We argue that TNNs represent a powerful yet underexplored framework for deep learning--one that deserves greater attention from both engineering and theoretical communities. Beyond compression, we highlight the value of TNNs as a flexible class of architectures with distinctive scaling properties and increased interpretability. A central feature of TNNs is the presence of bond indices, which introduce new latent spaces not found in conventional networks. These internal representations may provide deeper insight into the evolution of features across layers, potentially advancing the goals of mechanistic interpretability. We conclude by outlining several key research directions aimed at overcoming the practical barriers to scaling and adopting TNNs in modern deep learning workflows.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20132'&gt;arXiv:2505.20132&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 26 May 2025 15:32:28 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Derivations for the MPS overlap formulas of rational spin chains</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Tamas Gombor&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We derive a universal formula for the overlaps between integrable matrix product states (MPS) and Bethe eigenstates in $\mathfrak{gl}_{N}$ symmetric spin chains. This formula expresses the normalized overlap as a product of a MPS-independent Gaudin-determinant ratio and a MPS-dependent scalar factor constructed from eigenvalues of commuting operators, defined via the $K$-matrix associated with the MPS. Our proof is fully representation-independent and relies solely on algebraic Bethe Ansatz techniques and the $KT$-relation. We also propose a generalization of the overlap formula to $\mathfrak{so}_{N}$ and $\mathfrak{sp}_{N}$ spin chains, supported by algebra embeddings and low-rank isomorphisms. These results significantly broaden the class of integrable initial states for which exact overlap formulas are available, with implications for quantum quenches and defect CFTs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20234'&gt;arXiv:2505.20234&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 26 May 2025 17:15:26 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Observation of hadron scattering in a lattice gauge theory on a quantum computer</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Julian Schuhmacher, Guo-Xian Su, Jesse J. Osborne, Anthony Gandon, Jad C. Halimeh, Ivano Tavernelli&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Scattering experiments are at the heart of high-energy physics (HEP), breaking matter down to its fundamental constituents, probing its formation, and providing deep insight into the inner workings of nature. In the current huge drive to forge quantum computers into complementary venues that are ideally suited to capture snapshots of far-from-equilibrium HEP dynamics, a major goal is to utilize these devices for scattering experiments. A major obstacle in this endeavor has been the hardware overhead required to access the late-time post-collision dynamics while implementing the underlying gauge symmetry. Here, we report on the first quantum simulation of scattering in a lattice gauge theory (LGT), performed on \texttt{IBM}'s \texttt{ibm\_marrakesh} quantum computer. Specifically, we quantum-simulate the collision dynamics of electrons and positrons as well as mesons in a $\mathrm{U}(1)$ LGT representing $1+1$D quantum electrodynamics (QED), uncovering rich post-collision dynamics that we can precisely tune with a topological $\Theta$-term and the fermionic mass. By monitoring the time evolution of the scattering processes, we are able to distinguish between two main regimes in the wake of the collision. The first is characterized by the delocalization of particles when the topological $\Theta$-term is weak, while the second regime shows localized particles with a clear signature when the $\Theta$-term is nontrivial. Furthermore, we show that by quenching to a small mass at the collision point, inelastic scattering occurs with a large production of matter reminiscent of quantum many-body scarring. Our work provides a major step forward in the utility of quantum computers for investigating the real-time quantum dynamics of HEP collisions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20387'&gt;arXiv:2505.20387&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 26 May 2025 18:00:00 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Ginsparg-Wilson Hamiltonians with Improved Chiral Symmetry</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Hersh Singh&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We construct a family of Ginsparg-Wilson Hamiltonians with improved chiral properties, starting from a construction of Creutz-Horvath-Neuberger that provides a doubler-free Hamiltonian lattice regularization for Dirac fermions in even spacetime dimensions. We use a higher-order generalization of the Ginsparg-Wilson relation due to Fujikawa, which yields an order-$k$ Hamiltonian overlap operator for each integer $k \geq 0$, with an exactly conserved but nonquantized chiral charge that becomes quantized as $k \to \infty$. Our construction provides physical insight into how Fujikawa's higher-order Ginsparg-Wilson relation improves chiral symmetry while reproducing the anomaly, highlighting the trade-offs inherent in any Hamiltonian lattice realization of an anomalous chiral symmetry. This class of Hamiltonian lattice regularizations, with their tunable chiral symmetry properties, offers potential advantages for quantum and tensor-network simulations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20419'&gt;arXiv:2505.20419&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 26 May 2025 18:07:41 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

Quantum computing and quantum-inspired methods offer a promising avenue for efficiently simulating such phenomena. In this work, we investigate meson scattering in a (1+1)-dimensional Z2 lattice gauge theory with staggered fermions. We develop a quantum subspace expansion technique to construct high-fidelity meson creation operators across a broad range of masses and momenta. Using Tensor Networks simulations, we study both elastic and inelastic scattering and provide a detailed analysis of energy transfer, entanglement entropy, and new particle production during the dynamics. In addition, we design an efficient quantum circuit for meson wave packet preparation using Givens rotations, significantly reducing the circuit depth compared to existing methods. Our work provides a non-variational and scalable framework for simulating meson scattering on near-term quantum devices, and provides a concrete strategy for quantum simulation to analyze non-perturbative dynamical processes in confining gauge theories.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21240'&gt;arXiv:2505.21240&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 27 May 2025 14:19:53 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Reduced Density Matrices and Phase-Space Distributions in Thermofield Dynamics</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21302</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Bartosz Błasiak, Dominik Brey, Rocco Martinazzo, Irene Burghardt&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Thermofield dynamics (TFD) is a powerful framework to account for thermal effects in a wavefunction setting, and has been extensively used in physics and quantum optics. TFD relies on a duplicated state space and creates a correlated two-mode thermal state via a Bogoliubov transformation acting on the vacuum state. However, a very useful variant of TFD uses the vacuum state as initial condition and transfers the Bogoliubov transformation into the propagator. This variant, referred to here as the inverse Bogoliubov transformation (iBT) variant, has recently been applied to vibronic coupling problems and coupled-oscillator Hamiltonians in a chemistry context, where the method is combined with efficient tensor network methods for high-dimensional quantum propagation. In the iBT/TFD representation, the mode expectation values are clearly defined and easy to calculate, but the thermalized reduced particle distributions such as the reduced 1-particle densities or Wigner distributions are highly non-trivial due to the Bogoliubov back-transformation of the original thermal TFD wavefunction. Here we derive formal expressions for the reduced 1-particle density matrix (1-RDM) that uses the correlations between the real and tilde modes encoded in the associated reduced 2-particle density matrix (2-RDM). We apply this formalism to define the 1-RDM and the Wigner distributions in the special case of a thermal harmonic oscillator. Moreover, we discuss several approximate schemes that can be extended to higher-dimensional distributions. These methods are demonstrated for the thermal reduced 1-particle density of an anharmonic oscillator.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21302'&gt;arXiv:2505.21302&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 27 May 2025 15:05:10 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>It from ETH: Multi-interval Entanglement and Replica Wormholes from Large-$c$ BCFT Ensemble</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20385</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Hao Geng, Ling-Yan Hung, Yikun Jiang&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We provide a derivation of the Ryu-Takayanagi (RT) formula in 3D gravity for generic boundary subsystems--including RT surface phase transitions--directly from the dual two-dimensional conformal field theory (CFT). Our approach relies on the universal statistics of the algebraic conformal data and the large-$c$ behavior of conformal blocks with Cardy boundaries involved. We observe the emergence of 3D multi-boundary black holes with Karch-Randall branes from entangled states of any number of CFT's with and without Cardy boundaries. We obtain the RT formula from the CFT, in the high-temperature regime. Two direct applications are: $\textbf{1)}$ A simple derivation of the multi-interval entanglement entropy for the vacuum state of a single CFT; $\textbf{2)}$ A CFT-based detection of the emergence of replica wormholes in the context of entanglement islands and black hole microstate counting. Our framework yields the first holographic random tensor network that faithfully captures the entanglement structure of holographic CFTs. These results imply that bulk spacetime geometries indeed emerge from the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) in the dual field theory in the large-$c$ limit--a paradigm we refer to as $\textit{It from ETH}$.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20385'&gt;arXiv:2505.20385&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 26 May 2025 18:00:00 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Quantum computation of hadron scattering in a lattice gauge theory</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Zohreh Davoudi, Chung-Chun Hsieh, Saurabh V. Kadam&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We present a digital quantum computation of two-hadron scattering in a $Z_2$ lattice gauge theory in 1+1 dimensions. We prepare well-separated single-particle wave packets with desired momentum-space wavefunctions, and simulate their collision through digitized time evolution. Multiple hadronic wave packets can be produced using the efficient, systematically improvable algorithm of this work, achieving high fidelity with the target initial state. Specifically, employing a trapped-ion quantum computer (IonQ Forte), we prepare up to three meson wave packets using 11 and 27 system qubits, and simulate collision dynamics of two meson wave packets for the smaller system. Results for local observables are consistent with numerical simulations at early times, but decoherence effects limit evolution into long times. We demonstrate the critical role of high-fidelity initial states for precision measurements of state-sensitive observables, such as $S$-matrix elements. Our work establishes the potential of quantum computers in simulating hadron-scattering processes in strongly interacting gauge theories.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20408'&gt;arXiv:2505.20408&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 26 May 2025 18:00:49 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Pair binding and Hund's rule breaking in high-symmetry fullerenes</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21455</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; R. Rausch, C. Karrasch&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Highly-symmetric molecules often exhibit degenerate tight-binding states at the Fermi edge. This typically results in a magnetic ground state if small interactions are introduced in accordance with Hund's rule. In some cases, Hund's rule may be broken, which signals pair binding and goes hand-in-hand with an attractive pair-binding energy. We investigate pair binding and Hund's rule breaking for the Hubbard model on high-symmetry fullerenes C$_{20}$, C$_{28}$, C$_{40}$, and C$_{60}$ by using massive, large-scale density-matrix renormalization group calculations. We exploit the SU(2) spin symmetry, the U(1) charge symmetry, and optionally the Z(N) spatial rotation symmetry of the problem. For C$_{20}$, our results agree well with available exact-diagonalization data, but our approach is numerically much cheaper. We find a Mott transition at $U_c\sim2.2t$, which is much smaller than the previously reported value of $U_c\sim4.1t$ that was extrapolated from a few datapoints. We compute the pair-binding energy for arbitrary values of $U$ and observe that it remains overall repulsive. For larger fullerenes, we are not able to evaluate the pair binding energy with sufficient precision, but we can still investigate Hund's rule breaking. For C$_{28}$, we find that Hund's rule is fulfilled with a magnetic spin-2 ground state that transitions to a spin-1 state at $U_{c,1}\sim5.4t$ before the eventual Mott transition to a spin singlet takes place at $U_{c,2}\sim 11.6t$. For C$_{40}$, Hund's rule is broken in the singlet ground state, but is restored if the system is doped with one electron. Hund's rule is also broken for C$_{60}$, and the doping with two or three electrons results in a minimum-spin state. Our results support an electronic mechanism of superconductivity for C$_{60}$ lattices. We speculate that the high geometric frustration of small fullerenes is detrimental to pair binding.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21455'&gt;arXiv:2505.21455&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 27 May 2025 17:27:21 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Scalable Quantum Algorithm for Meson Scattering in a Lattice Gauge Theory</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Yahui Chai, Yibin Guo, Stefan Kühn&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Scattering processes are fundamental for understanding the structure of matter, yet simulating their real-time dynamics remains challenging for classical computers. Quantum computing and quantum-inspired methods offer a promising avenue for efficiently simulating such phenomena. In this work, we investigate meson scattering in a (1+1)-dimensional Z2 lattice gauge theory with staggered fermions. We develop a quantum subspace expansion technique to construct high-fidelity meson creation operators across a broad range of masses and momenta. Using Tensor Networks simulations, we study both elastic and inelastic scattering and provide a detailed analysis of energy transfer, entanglement entropy, and new particle production during the dynamics. In addition, we design an efficient quantum circuit for meson wave packet preparation using Givens rotations, significantly reducing the circuit depth compared to existing methods. Our work provides a non-variational and scalable framework for simulating meson scattering on near-term quantum devices, and provides a concrete strategy for quantum simulation to analyze non-perturbative dynamical processes in confining gauge theories.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21240'&gt;arXiv:2505.21240&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 27 May 2025 14:19:53 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>LaX: Boosting Low-Rank Training of Foundation Models via Latent Crossing</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21732</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Ruijie Zhang, Ziyue Liu, Zhengyang Wang, Zheng Zhang&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Training foundation models such as ViTs and LLMs requires tremendous computing cost. Low-rank matrix or tensor factorization offers a parameter-efficient alternative, but often downgrades performance due to the restricted parameter space. In this work, we introduce {\textbf{Latent Crossing (LaX)}} -- a simple yet effective plug-and-play module that enhances the capacity of low-rank models by enabling information flow across low-rank subspaces. We extensively validate the benefits of LaX on pre-training tasks with ViT-Base/Large and LLaMA-like models ranging from 60M to 1B parameters. LaX boosts low-rank model performance to match or exceed the full-rank baselines while using 2-3\(\times\) fewer parameters. When equipped with low-rank adapters (i.e., LoRA) for fine-tuning LLaMA-7/13B, LaX consistently improves performance on arithmetic and common sense reasoning tasks with negligible cost.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21732'&gt;arXiv:2505.21732&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 27 May 2025 20:22:44 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Breaking the Curse of Dimensionality: Solving Configurational Integrals for Crystalline Solids by Tensor Networks</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21826</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Duc P. Truong, Benjamin Nebgen, Derek DeSantis, Dimiter N. Petsev, Kim Ø. Rasmussen, Boian S. Alexandrov&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Accurately evaluating configurational integrals for dense solids remains a central and difficult challenge in the statistical mechanics of condensed systems. Here, we present a novel tensor network approach that reformulates the high-dimensional configurational integral for identical-particle crystals into a sequence of computationally efficient summations. We represent the integrand as a high-dimensional tensor and apply tensor-train (TT) decomposition together with a custom TT-cross interpolation scheme. This approach avoids the need to explicitly construct the full tensor, which would otherwise be computationally intractable. We introduce tailored rank-1 and rank-2 schemes optimized for sharply peaked Boltzmann probability densities, typical in crystalline solids. When applied to the calculation of internal energy and pressure-temperature curves for crystalline copper (Cu) and argon (Ar), as well as the alpha-to-beta phase transition in tin (Sn), our method accurately reproduces molecular dynamics simulation results using tight-binding, machine learning (HIP-NN), and MEAM potentials, all within seconds of computation time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21826'&gt;arXiv:2505.21826&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 27 May 2025 23:26:33 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Subsystem Symmetry-Protected Topological Phases from Subsystem SymTFT of 2-Foliated Exotic Tensor Gauge Theory</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22261</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Qiang Jia, Zhian Jia&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Symmetry topological field theory (SymTFT), or topological holography, posits a correspondence between symmetries in a $d$-dimensional theory and topological order in a $(d+1)$-dimensional theory. In this work, we extend this framework to subsystem symmetries and develop subsystem SymTFT as a systematic tool to characterize and classify subsystem symmetry-protected topological (SSPT) phases. For $(2+1)$D gapped phases, we introduce a 2-foliated $(3+1)$D exotic tensor gauge theory (which is equivalent to 2-foliated $(3+1)$D BF theory via exotic duality) as the subsystem SymTFT and systematically analyze its topological boundary conditions and linearly rigid subsystem symmetries. Taking subsystem symmetry groups $G = \mathbb{Z}_N$ and $G=\mathbb{Z}_N \times \mathbb{Z}_M$ as examples, we demonstrate how to recover the classification scheme $\mathcal{C}[G] = H^{2}(G^{\times 2}, U(1)) / \left( H^2(G, U(1)) \right)^3$, which was previously derived by examining topological invariant under linear subsystem-symmetric local unitary transformations in the lattice Hamiltonian formalism. To illustrate the correspondence between field-theoretic and lattice descriptions, we further analyze $\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2$ and $\mathbb{Z}_N \times \mathbb{Z}_M$ cluster state models as concrete examples.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22261'&gt;arXiv:2505.22261&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 28 May 2025 11:47:22 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Flow to Nishimori universality in weakly monitored quantum circuits with qubit loss</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22720</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Malte Pütz, Romain Vasseur, Andreas W. W. Ludwig, Simon Trebst, Guo-Yi Zhu&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; In circuit-based quantum state preparation, qubit loss and coherent errors are circuit imperfections that imperil the formation of long-range entanglement beyond a certain threshold. The critical theory at the threshold is a continuous entanglement transition known to be described by a (2+0)-dimensional non-unitary conformal field theory which, for the two types of imperfections of certain circuits, is described by either percolation or Nishimori criticality, respectively. Here we study the threshold behavior when the two types of errors simultaneously occur and show that, when moving away from the Clifford-regime of projective stabilizer measurements, the percolation critical point becomes unstable and the critical theory flows to Nishimori universality. We track this critical renormalization group (RG) crossover flow by mapping out the entanglement phase diagrams, parametrized by the probability and strength of random weak measurements, of two dual protocols preparing surface code or GHZ-class cat states from a parent cluster state via constant-depth circuits. Extensive numerical simulations, using hybrid Gaussian fermion and tensor network / Monte Carlo sampling techniques on systems with more than a million qubits, demonstrate that an infinitesimal deviation from the Clifford regime leads to a sudden, strongly non-monotonic entanglement growth at the incipient non-unitary RG flow. We argue that spectra of scaling dimensions of both the percolation and Nishimori fixed points exhibit multifractality. For percolation, we provide the exact (non-quadratic) multifractal spectrum of exponents, while for the Nishimori fixed point we show high-precision numerical results for five leading exponents characterizing multifractality.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22720'&gt;arXiv:2505.22720&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 28 May 2025 18:00:01 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Optimizing QUBO on a quantum computer by mimicking imaginary time evolution</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22924</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Yahui Chai, Alice Di Tucci&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We propose a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm for solving QUBO problems using an Imaginary Time Evolution-Mimicking Circuit (ITEMC). The circuit parameters are optimized to closely mimic imaginary time evolution, using only single- and two-qubit expectation values. This significantly reduces the measurement overhead by avoiding full energy evaluation. By updating the initial state based on results from last step iteratively, the algorithm quickly converges to the low-energy solutions. With a pre-sorting step that optimizes quantum gate ordering based on QUBO coefficients, the convergence is further improved. Our classical simulations achieve approximation ratios above 0.99 up to 150 qubits. Furthermore, the linear scaling of entanglement entropy with system size suggests that the circuit is challenging to simulate classically using tensor networks. We also demonstrate hardware runs on IBM's device for 40, 60, and 80 qubits, and obtain solutions compatible with that from simulated annealing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22924'&gt;arXiv:2505.22924&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 28 May 2025 22:56:57 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

Such models encapsulate the physics of condensed phase systems immersed in optical cavities. We use this method, combined with tensor network influence functionals, to study the dynamics of the Dicke model coupled to non-Markovian local dephasing baths at zero temperature, which has a superradiant phase transition in the mean-field limit. The method corrects a spurious initial state dependence found in the mean-field dynamics and describes the emergence of new time scales which are absent in the mean-field dynamics. Our formalism, based on density matrices, is applicable to other quantum optical systems with one-to-all interactions at finite temperatures.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23028'&gt;arXiv:2505.23028&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 29 May 2025 03:13:47 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Emergent Quasiparticles \&amp; Field-Tuned RIXS Spectra in a Trimerized Spin-1/2 Chain</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Subhajyoti Pal, Pradeep Thakur, Ashis Kumar Nandy, Anamitra Mukherjee&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We investigate spin-flip excitations in the spin-1/2 trimer chain $\rm{Cu_3(P_2O_6OH)_2}$, featuring an antiferromagnetic exchange motif $J_1$-$J_1$-$J_2$ with $J_1 &lt; J_2$. Using density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations, we demonstrate that single-spin-flip processes induced by resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) generate emergent gapless modes governed by the underlying trimer periodicity alongside distinct high-energy excitations. By combining exact diagonalization and real-space renormalization group (RG) techniques, we attribute these features to fractionalized spinons and composite quasiparticles arising from one- and two-trimer excitations. Furthermore, we show that multi-spin RIXS excitations yield experimentally distinguishable spectral signatures of composite modes absent in single-spin-flip spectra. At the field-induced 1/3 magnetization plateau, single-spin-flip RIXS spectra evolves with the magnetic field to favor spin-polarized composite quasiparticles. This trend culminates in a gapless spectrum of spin-1 excitations beyond the plateau, paving the way for field-tuned Bose condensation of composite modes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23208'&gt;arXiv:2505.23208&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 29 May 2025 07:49:07 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>A New Scaling Function for QAOA Tensor Network Simulations</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23256</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Goro Miki, Yasuhiro Tokura&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; With the rapid development of quantum computers in recent years, the importance of performance evaluation in quantum algorithms has been increasing. One method that has gained attention for performing this evaluation on classical computers is tensor networks. Tensor networks not only reduce the computational cost required for simulations by using approximations but are also deeply connected to entanglement. Entanglement is one of the most important elements for the quantum advantages of quantum algorithms, but the direct relationship between quantum advantages and entanglement remains largely unexplored. Tensor networks are promising as a means to address this question. In this study, we focus on the entanglement in the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA). This study aims to investigate entanglement in QAOA by examining the relationship between the approximation rates of tensor networks and the performance of QAOA. Specifically, we actually perform tensor network simulations of QAOA on a classical computer and extend the study of the scaling relations presented in previous research. We have discovered that scaling relations hold even when entanglement entropy is used as the vertical axis. Furthermore, by analyzing the results of the numerical calculations, we propose a new function for the scaling relation. Additionally, we discovered interesting relationships regarding the behavior of entanglement in QAOA during our analysis. This research is expected to provide new insights into the theoretical foundation of the scaling relations presented in previous studies.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23256'&gt;arXiv:2505.23256&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 29 May 2025 09:01:44 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Laura Grigori, Muhammad Hassan&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) algorithm is a popular alternating minimization scheme for solving high-dimensional optimization problems in the tensor train format. Classical DMRG, however, is based on sequential minimization, which raises challenges in its implementation on parallel computing architectures. To overcome this, we propose a novel additive two-level DMRG algorithm that combines independent, local minimization steps with a global update step using a subsequent coarse-space minimization. Our proposed algorithm, which is directly inspired by additive Schwarz methods from the domain decomposition literature, is particularly amenable to implementation on parallel, distributed architectures since both the local minimization steps and the construction of the coarse-space can be performed in parallel. Numerical experiments on strongly correlated molecular systems demonstrate that the method achieves competitive convergence rates while achieving significant parallel speedups.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23429'&gt;arXiv:2505.23429&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 29 May 2025 13:24:07 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Dominant Kitaev interaction and field-induced quantum phase transitions in triangular-lattice KCeSe2</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Mingtai Xie, Zheng Zhang, Weizhen Zhuo, Wei Xu, Jinfeng Zhu, Jan Embs, Lei Wang, Zikang Li, Huanpeng Bu, Anmin Zhang, Feng Jin, Jianting Ji, Zhongwen Ouyang, Liusuo Wu, Jie Ma, Qingming Zhang&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Realizing Kitaev interactions on triangular lattices offers a compelling platform for exploring quantum-spin-liquid physics beyond the conventional honeycomb lattice framework. Here, we investigate the triangular-lattice antiferromagnet KCeSe2, where multiple probes reveal strong magnetic anisotropy suggesting significant Kitaev physics. Through detailed and combined analysis of magnetization, neutron scattering, and thermodynamic experiments, we identify dominant ferromagnetic Kitaev ($K = -1.82$ K) and antiferromagnetic Heisenberg ($J = 1.34$ K) interactions that stabilize a stripe-$yz$ ordered ground state via an order-by-disorder mechanism. Magnetic fields applied along the Kitaev bond direction induce two phase transitions at 1.67 T and 3.8 T, consistent with density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) calculations predictions of a progression from stripe-$yz$ to stripe-canted and spin-polarized phases. Near the 1.67 T quantum critical point, enhanced quantum fluctuations suggest conditions favorable for exotic excitations. These results establish KCeSe2 as a platform for exploring Kitaev physics on triangular lattices.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23502'&gt;arXiv:2505.23502&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 29 May 2025 14:47:51 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Domain-Aware Tensor Network Structure Search</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23537</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Giorgos Iacovides, Wuyang Zhou, Chao Li, Qibin Zhao, Danilo Mandic&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Tensor networks (TNs) provide efficient representations of high-dimensional data, yet identification of the optimal TN structures, the so called tensor network structure search (TN-SS) problem, remains a challenge. Current state-of-the-art (SOTA) algorithms are computationally expensive as they require extensive function evaluations, which is prohibitive for real-world applications. In addition, existing methods ignore valuable domain information inherent in real-world tensor data and lack transparency in their identified TN structures. To this end, we propose a novel TN-SS framework, termed the tnLLM, which incorporates domain information about the data and harnesses the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to directly predict suitable TN structures. The proposed framework involves a domain-aware prompting pipeline which instructs the LLM to infer suitable TN structures based on the real-world relationships between tensor modes. In this way, our approach is capable of not only iteratively optimizing the objective function, but also generating domain-aware explanations for the identified structures. Experimental results demonstrate that tnLLM achieves comparable TN-SS objective function values with much fewer function evaluations compared to SOTA algorithms. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the LLM-enabled domain information can be used to find good initializations in the search space for sampling-based SOTA methods to accelerate their convergence while preserving theoretical performance guarantees.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23537'&gt;arXiv:2505.23537&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 29 May 2025 15:18:33 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Roughening and dynamics of an electric flux string in a (2+1)D lattice gauge theory</title>

Using numerical simulations with matrix product states, we explore the static and dynamical properties of an electric flux string between two static charges as the coupling is varied and approaches the deconfinement phase transition from the confined phase. Within the roughening region, we obtain the universal L\"uscher correction to the confining potential and observe the expected restoration of rotational symmetry. Our simulations of the out-of-equilibrium evolution of a string reveal that the growth of the entanglement entropy of the state and the string width exhibit qualitatively different behavior in the roughening region compared to the deeply confined one. In particular, we find that the rate of entropy growth is consistent with an effective description of the string excitations by a bosonic model in the roughening phase.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23853'&gt;arXiv:2505.23853&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 29 May 2025 01:56:52 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Instantons and topological order in two-leg electron ladders: A universality class</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24130</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; S. -R. Eric Yang, Hyun Cheol Lee, Hoang-Anh Le, In-Hwan Lee&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Our numerical study of the disordered Hubbard model with nearest-neighbor hopping shows that a two-leg electron ladder has a finite topological entanglement entropy in the regime where the density of states exhibits an exponentially decaying gap. The value of the topological entanglement entropy suggests that two-leg ladders belong to the same universality class as graphene zigzag nanoribbons, despite several structural differences. A Shankar-Witten-type bosonization Lagrangian with disorder captures several features of the numerically obtained results for disordered two-leg ladders. Additionally, we propose a Lagrangian in which the fusion of two semions residing on different chains generates a fermion (instanton). We apply this Lagrangian within the framework of the pinned charge-density-wave model and compute the relevant Green's function using the bosonization method. This approach predicts a linear density of states at a critical disorder strength. Below this threshold, a soft gap emerges, which is in qualitative agreement with our numerical results.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24130'&gt;arXiv:2505.24130&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 30 May 2025 01:57:23 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

Tensor networks are mathematical models on the intersection of classical and quantum machine learning, which present a promising and efficient alternative for tackling these challenges. In this work, we propose a tensor network-based strategy for anomaly detection at the LHC and demonstrate its superior performance in identifying new phenomena compared to established quantum methods. Our model is a parametrized Matrix Product State with an isometric feature map, processing a latent representation of simulated LHC data generated by an autoencoder. Our results highlight the potential of tensor networks to enhance new-physics discovery.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00102'&gt;arXiv:2506.00102&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 30 May 2025 14:18:53 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Fermionic Magic Resources of Quantum Many-Body Systems</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00116</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Piotr Sierant, Paolo Stornati, Xhek Turkeshi&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Understanding the computational complexity of quantum states is a central challenge in quantum many-body physics. In qubit systems, fermionic Gaussian states can be efficiently simulated on classical computers and hence can be employed as a natural baseline for evaluating quantum complexity. In this work, we develop a framework for quantifying fermionic magic resources, also referred to as fermionic non-Gaussianity, which constitutes an essential resource for universal quantum computation. We leverage the algebraic structure of the fermionic commutant to define the fermionic antiflatness (FAF)-an efficiently computable and experimentally accessible measure of non-Gaussianity, with a clear physical interpretation in terms of Majorana fermion correlation functions. Studying systems in equilibrium, we show that FAF detects phase transitions, reveals universal features of critical points, and uncovers special solvable points in many-body systems. Extending the analysis to out-of-equilibrium settings, we demonstrate that fermionic magic resources become more abundant in highly excited eigenstates of many-body systems. We further investigate the growth and saturation of FAF under ergodic many-body dynamics, highlighting the roles of conservation laws and locality in constraining the increase of non-Gaussianity during unitary evolution. This work provides a framework for probing quantum many-body complexity from the perspective of fermionic Gaussian states and opens up new directions for investigating fermionic magic resources in many-body systems. Our results establish fermionic non-Gaussianity, alongside entanglement and non-stabilizerness, as a resource relevant not only to foundational studies but also to experimental platforms aiming to achieve quantum advantage.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00116'&gt;arXiv:2506.00116&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 30 May 2025 18:00:01 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

Gullans&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We introduce a fault-tolerant protocol for code concatenation using a butterfly network architecture with high noise thresholds and low ancilla overhead to allow implementation on current devices. We develop a probability passing decoder using tensor networks that applies Bayesian updates to the marginal error probabilities after each layer of checks, achieving a state preparation threshold of $e_c \approx 0.089$ for erasure errors, and $\approx 0.015$ for unheralded noise. We implement our state preparation protocol on ion-trap hardware with added noise to demonstrate the threshold behavior in a real quantum device. We further theoretically test the performance of our scheme as a quantum memory and for universal quantum computation through the preparation of low-noise magic states for state distillation and $T$-gate injection.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00579'&gt;arXiv:2506.00579&lt;/a&gt;] Published Sat, 31 May 2025 14:24:43 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Probing Quantum Spin Systems with Kolmogorov-Arnold Neural Network Quantum States</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01891</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Mahmud Ashraf Shamim, Eric A F Reinhardt, Talal Ahmed Chowdhury, Sergei Gleyzer, Paulo T Araujo&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Neural Quantum States (NQS) are a class of variational wave functions parametrized by neural networks (NNs) to study quantum many-body systems. In this work, we propose \texttt{SineKAN}, a NQS \textit{ansatz} based on Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), to represent quantum mechanical wave functions as nested univariate functions. We show that \texttt{SineKAN} wavefunction with learnable sinusoidal activation functions can capture the ground state energies, fidelities and various correlation functions of the one dimensional Transverse-Field Ising model, Anisotropic Heisenberg model, and Antiferromagnetic $J_{1}-J_{2}$ model with different chain lengths. In our study of the $J_1-J_2$ model with $L=100$ sites, we find that the \texttt{SineKAN} model outperforms several previously explored neural quantum state \textit{ans\"atze}, including Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs), Long Short-Term Memory models (LSTMs), and Multi-layer Perceptrons (MLP) \textit{a.k.a.} Feed Forward Neural Networks, when compared to the results obtained from the Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) algorithm. We find that \texttt{SineKAN} models can be trained to high precisions and accuracies with minimal computational costs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01891'&gt;arXiv:2506.01891&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 02 Jun 2025 17:18:40 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Magnetic correlations in the $SU(3)$ triangular-lattice $t$-$J$ model at finite doping</title>

Ultracold alkaline-earth atoms and molecules now enable experimental realizations of SU(N)-symmetric Fermi-Hubbard models, yet theoretical understanding of these systems, particularly at finite doping remains limited. Here we investigate the strong-coupling limit of the $SU(3)$ symmetric Fermi-Hubbard model on the triangular lattice with dimensions up to $9\times9$ lattice sites across the full doping range. Using a three-flavor extension of Gutzwiller-projected hidden fermion determinant states (G-HFDS), a neural network based variational ansatz, we analyze two- and three-point spin-spin and spin-spin-hole correlations of the $SU(3)$ Cartan generators. We further study binding energies for large periodic systems, and compare our results to the paradigmatic $SU(2)$ square lattice equivalent, finding strikingly similar magnetic correlations, but enhanced binding energies. Our results provide a foundation for future exploration of doped SU(N) Mott insulators, providing valuable insights for both theoretical developments and quantum simulation experiments.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01915'&gt;arXiv:2506.01915&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 02 Jun 2025 17:35:58 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Zhao Zhang&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; While highly entangled ground states of gapless local Hamiltonians have been known to exist in one dimension, their 2D counterparts were only recently found, with rather sophisticated interactions involving at least 4 neighboring degrees of freedom. In this letter, a 2D lattice system interacting only between two nearest neighboring sites is proposed, which has a unique ground state with volume scaling of entanglement entropy. The system undergoes an entanglement phase transition with enhanced entanglement entropy at the critical point compared to the previous construction from coupling orthogonal arrays of one-dimensional chains, but the spectral gap in the highly entangled phase decays faster. A tensor network representation is composed of tensors with lower rank, and has a similar global geometry.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02103'&gt;arXiv:2506.02103&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 02 Jun 2025 18:00:00 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Learning Circuits with Infinite Tensor Networks</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Joe Gibbs, Lukasz Cincio&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Hamiltonian simulation on quantum computers is strongly constrained by gate counts, motivating techniques to reduce circuit depths. While tensor networks are natural competitors to quantum computers, we instead leverage them to support circuit design, with datasets of tensor networks enabling a unitary synthesis inspired by quantum machine learning. For a target simulation in the thermodynamic limit, translation invariance is exploited to significantly reduce the optimization complexity, avoiding a scaling with system size. Our approach finds circuits to efficiently prepare ground states, and perform time evolution on both infinite and finite systems with substantially lower gate depths than conventional Trotterized methods. In addition to reducing CNOT depths, we motivate similar utility for fault-tolerant quantum algorithms, with a demonstrated $5.2\times$ reduction in $T$-count to realize $e^{-iHt}$. The key output of our approach is the optimized unit-cell of a translation invariant circuit. This provides an advantage for Hamiltonian simulation of finite, yet arbitrarily large, systems on real quantum computers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02105'&gt;arXiv:2506.02105&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 02 Jun 2025 18:00:01 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Classical spin liquids from frustrated Ising models in hyperbolic space</title>

Motivated by the recent interest in many-body system in negatively curved space, we study hyperbolic frustrated Ising models. Specifically, we consider nearest-neighbor Ising models on tesselations with odd-length loops in two-dimensional hyperbolic space. For finite systems with open boundaries we determine the ground-state degeneracy exactly, and we perform extensive finite-temperature Monte-Carlo simulations to obtain thermodynamic data as well as correlation functions. We show that the shape of the boundary, constituting an extensive part of the system, can be used to control low-energy states: Depending on the boundary, we find ordered or disordered ground states. Our results demonstrate how geometric frustration acts in curved space to produce classical spin liquids.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02113'&gt;arXiv:2506.02113&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 02 Jun 2025 18:00:04 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Quantum Complexity and Chaos in Many-Qudit Doped Clifford Circuits</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02127</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Beatrice Magni, Xhek Turkeshi&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We investigate the emergence of quantum complexity and chaos in doped Clifford circuits acting on qudits of odd prime dimension $d$. Using doped Clifford Weingarten calculus and a replica tensor network formalism, we derive exact results and perform large-scale simulations in regimes challenging for tensor network and Pauli-based methods. We begin by analyzing generalized stabilizer entropies, computable magic monotones in many-qudit systems, and identify a dynamical phase transition in the doping rate, marking the breakdown of classical simulability and the onset of Haar-random behavior. The critical behavior is governed by the qudit dimension and the magic content of the non-Clifford gate. Using the qudit $T$-gate as a benchmark, we show that higher-dimensional qudits converge faster to Haar-typical stabilizer entropies. For qutrits ($d=3$), analytical predictions match numerics on brickwork circuits, showing that locality plays a limited role in magic spreading. We also examine anticoncentration and entanglement growth, showing that $O(\log N)$ non-Clifford gates suffice for approximating Haar expectation values to precision $\varepsilon$, and relate antiflatness measures to stabilizer entropies in qutrit systems. Finally, we analyze out-of-time-order correlators and show that a finite density of non-Clifford gates is needed to induce chaos, with a sharp transition fixed by the local dimension, twice that of the magic transition. Altogether, these results establish a unified framework for diagnosing complexity in doped Clifford circuits and deepen our understanding of resource theories in multiqudit systems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02127'&gt;arXiv:2506.02127&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 02 Jun 2025 18:01:01 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Spin-chain multichannel Kondo model via image impurity boundary condition</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Jordan Gaines, Guangjie Li, Jukka Väyrynen&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; One of the signature observables for the electronic multichannel Kondo model is the impurity entropy, which was claimed to be found in $J_1$-$J_2$ Heisenberg chain with open boundary condition (OBC) and periodic boundary condition (PBC), respectively for the one-channel and two-channel case. However, it is not clear how to generalize OBC and PBC in Heisenberg chains to find the multichannel Kondo impurity entropy with more than two channels. In this paper, we demonstrate that the correct boundary condition for realizing multichannel Kondo physics in Heisenberg chains is the image impurity boundary condition (IIBC), which yields the expected impurity entropy, $\ln[(\sqrt{5}+1)/2]$ for the three-channel case and $\ln\sqrt{3}$ for the four-channel case. Moreover, the IIBC reduces to OBC for the one-channel case and to PBC for the two-channel case. With IIBC, the finite-size scaling of the impurity entropy and the total spin both match the finite-temperature correction in the electronic multichannel Kondo model. Additionally, we show that the XXZ anisotropy reduces the impurity entropy through a power law of the effective Luttinger liquid parameter.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02399'&gt;arXiv:2506.02399&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 03 Jun 2025 03:36:03 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Tensor Renormalization Group Meets Computer Assistance</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03247</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Nikolay Ebel, Tom Kennedy, Slava Rychkov&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Tensor renormalization group, originally devised as a numerical technique, is emerging as a rigorous analytical framework for studying lattice models in statistical physics. Here we introduce a new renormalization map - the 2x1 map - which coarse-grains the lattice anisotropically by a factor of two in one direction followed by a 90-degree rotation. We develop a novel graphical language that translates the action of the 2x1 map into a system of inequalities on tensor components, with rigorous estimates in the Hilbert-Schmidt norm. We define a finite-dimensional "bounding box" called the hat-tensor, and a master function governing its RG flow. Iterating this function numerically, we establish convergence to the high-temperature fixed point for tensors lying within a quantifiable neighborhood. Our main theorem shows that tensors with deviations bounded by 0.02 in 63 orthogonal sectors flow to the fixed point. We also apply the method to specific models - the 2D Ising and XY models - obtaining explicit bounds on their high-temperature phase. This work brings the Tensor RG program closer towards a rigorous, computer-assisted construction of critical fixed points.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03247'&gt;arXiv:2506.03247&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 03 Jun 2025 18:00:01 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Theory of Angle Resolved Photoemission Spectroscopy of Altermagnetic Mott Insulators</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03263</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Lorenzo Lanzini, Purnendu Das, Michael Knap&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Altermagnetism has emerged as an unconventional form of collinear magnetism with spatial rotational symmetries, that give rise to strongly spin-split bands despite of an underlying fully-compensated antiferromagnetic order. Here, we develop a theory for the Angle Resolved Photoemission Spectroscopy (ARPES) response of altermagnetic Mott insulators. Crucially, the spectrum does not simply reflect the non-interacting band structure, but instead a magnetic polaron is formed at low energies, that can be interpreted as a spinon-holon bound state. We develop a spinon-holon parton theory and predict a renormalized bandwidth that we confirm by tensor network simulations. We analyze the characteristic spin-split spectrum and identify a spin-dependent spectral weight of the magnetic polaron, resulting from the altermagnetic symmetry. Our work paves the way for a systematic study of doping effects and correlation phenomena in altermagnetic Mott insulators.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03263'&gt;arXiv:2506.03263&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 03 Jun 2025 18:00:14 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Computational Complexity of Non-Hermitian Quantum Systems</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03435</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Brian Barch, Daniel Lidar&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We analyze the computational power of non-Hermitian quantum dynamics, i.e., conditional time evolutions that arise when a quantum system is monitored and one postselects on a particular measurement record. We establish an approximate equivalence between post-selection and arbitrary non-Hermitian Hamiltonians. Namely, first we establish hardness in the following sense: Let $U=e^{-iHt}$ be an NH gate on $n$ qubits whose smallest and largest singular values differ by at least $2^{-\text{poly}(n)}$. Together with any universal set of unitary gates, the ability to apply such a gate lets one efficiently emulate postselection. The resulting model decides every language in PostBQP; hence, under standard complexity conjectures, fully scalable NH quantum computers are unlikely to be engineered. Second, we establish upper bounds which show that conversely, any non-Hermitian evolution can be written as a unitary on a system-meter pair followed by postselecting the meter. This ``purification'' is compact -- it introduces only $O(\delta^{2})$ Trotter error per time step $\delta$ -- so any NH model whose purification lies in a strongly simulable unitary family (e.g., Clifford, matchgate, or low-bond-dimension tensor-network circuits) remains efficiently simulable. Thus, non-Hermitian physics neither guarantees a quantum advantage nor precludes efficient classical simulation: its complexity is controlled by the singular-value radius of the evolution operator and by the structure of its unitary purification.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03435'&gt;arXiv:2506.03435&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 03 Jun 2025 22:35:28 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Violation of Luttinger's theorem in one-dimensional interacting fermions</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04064</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Meng Gao, Yin Zhong&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Using the density matrix renormalization group method, we systematically investigate the evolution of the Luttinger integral in the one-dimensional generalized t-V model as a function of filling and interaction strength, identifying three representative phases. In the weak-coupling regime, the zero-frequency Green's function shows a branch-cut structure at the Fermi momentum, and the Luttinger integral accurately reflects the particle density. As the interaction increases, the spectral weight near the Fermi momentum is gradually suppressed. In the strong-coupling regime near half-filling, the singularity is progressively destroyed, accompanied by zeros in the real part of the Green's function. This leads to a non-Fermi-liquid metallic phase beyond the Luttinger liquid paradigm. While spectral weight remains at the original Fermi momentum, the singularity fades. Meanwhile, zeros with negligible spectral weight appear elsewhere, significantly affecting the integral. At half-filling, a single-particle gap opens, and the Green's function vanishes across momentum space, indicating the suppression of low-energy states, consistent with an insulating charge-density-wave phase. These results suggest that the breakdown of the Luttinger theorem arises from the interplay of interaction-driven excitation evolution and particle-hole symmetry breaking, leading to a continuous reconstruction of the generalized Fermi surface from topologically protected to correlation-driven.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04064'&gt;arXiv:2506.04064&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 04 Jun 2025 15:31:10 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Entanglement renormalization circuits for $2d$ Gaussian Fermion States</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04200</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Sing Lam Wong, Andrew C. Potter&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The simulation of entangled ground-states of quantum materials remains challenging for classical computational methods in more than one spatial dimension, and is a prime target for quantum computational advantage. To this end, an important goal is to identify efficient quantum state preparation protocols that minimize the physical qubit number and circuit depth resources required to capture higher-dimensional quantum correlations. This work introduces a quantum circuit compression algorithm for Gaussian fermion states based on the multi-scale entanglement renormalization ansatz (MERA), which provides an exponential reduction in the circuit depth required to approximate highly-entangled ground-states relevant for quantum materials simulations. The algorithm, termed two-dimensional Gaussian MERA ($2d$ GMERA), extends MERA techniques to compress higher-dimensional Gaussian states. Through numerical simulations of the Haldane model on a honeycomb lattice, the method is shown to accurately capture area-law entangled states including topologically trivial insulators, Chern insulators, and critical Dirac semimetals. While Gaussian states alone are classically simulable, this approach establishes empirical upper bounds on quantum resources needed to prepare free fermion states that are adiabatically connected to correlated ground states, providing guidance for implementing these protocols on near-term quantum devices and offering a foundation for simulating more complex quantum materials. Finally, we develop a novel fermion-to-qubit encoding scheme, based on an expanding $2d$ topological order, that enables implementing fermionic rotations via qubit Pauli rotations with constant Pauli weight independent of system size.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04200'&gt;arXiv:2506.04200&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 04 Jun 2025 17:44:17 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Exponential distillation of dominant eigenproperties</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Bence Bakó, Tenzan Araki, Bálint Koczor&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Estimating observable expectation values in eigenstates of quantum systems has a broad range of applications and is an area where early fault-tolerant quantum computers may provide practical quantum advantage. We develop a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm that enables the estimation of an arbitrary observable expectation value in an eigenstate, given an initial state is supplied that has dominant overlap with the targeted eigenstate -- but may overlap with any other eigenstates. Our approach builds on, and is conceptually similar to purification-based error mitigation techniques; however, it achieves exponential suppression of algorithmic errors using only a single copy of the quantum state. The key innovation is that random time evolution is applied in the quantum computer to create an average mixed quantum state, which is then virtually purified with exponential efficacy. We prove rigorous performance guarantees and conclude that the complexity of our approach depends directly on the energy gap in the problem Hamiltonian, and is thus comparable to state-of-the-art hybrid techniques. We demonstrate in a broad range of numerical simulations the applicability of our framework in near-term and early fault-tolerant settings. Furthermore, we demonstrate in a 100-qubit example that direct classical simulation of our approach enables the prediction of ground and excited state properties of quantum systems using tensor network techniques, which we recognize as a quantum-inspired classical approach.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04380'&gt;arXiv:2506.04380&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 04 Jun 2025 18:49:08 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>A Fast, Accurate and Oscillation-free Spectral Collocation Solver for High-dimensional Transport Problems</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Nicola Cavallini, Gianmarco Manzini, Daniele Funaro, Andrea Favalli&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Transport phenomena-describing the movement of particles, energy, or other physical quantities-are fundamental in various scientific disciplines, including nuclear physics, plasma physics, astrophysics, engineering, and the natural sciences. However, solving the associated seven-dimensional transport equations poses a significant computational challenge due to the curse of dimensionality. We introduce the Tensor Train Superconsistent Spectral (T${^2}$S${^2}$) solver to address this challenge, integrating Spectral Collocation for exponential convergence, Superconsistency for stabilization in transport-dominated regimes, and Tensor Train format for substantial data compression. T${^2}$S${^2}$ enforces a dimension-wise superconsistent condition compatible with tensor structures, achieving extremely low compression ratios, in the order of $(10^{-12})$, while preserving spectral accuracy. Numerical experiments on linear problems demonstrate that T${^2}$S${^2}$ can solve high-dimensional transport problems in minutes on standard hardware, making previously intractable problems computationally feasible. This advancement opens new avenues for efficiently and accurately modeling complex transport phenomena.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04732'&gt;arXiv:2506.04732&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 05 Jun 2025 08:07:07 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Hybrid between biologically inspired and quantum inspired many-body states</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Miha Srdinšek, Xavier Waintal&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Deep neural networks can represent very different sorts of functions, including complex quantum many-body states. Tensor networks can also represent these states, have more structure and are easier to optimize. However, they can be prohibitively costly computationally in two or higher dimensions. Here, we propose a generalization of the perceptron - the perceptrain - which borrows features from the two different formalisms. We construct variational many-body ansatz from a simple network of perceptrains. The network can be thought of as a neural network with a few distinct features inherited from tensor networks. These include efficient local optimization akin to the density matrix renormalization algorithm, instead of optimizing of all the parameters at once; the possibility to dynamically increase the number of parameters during the optimization; the possibility to compress the state to avoid overfitting; and a structure that remains quantum-inspired. We showcase the ansatz using a combination of Variational Monte-Carlo (VMC) and Green Function Monte-Carlo (GFMC) on a $10\times 10$ transverse field quantum Ising model with a long range $1/r^6$ antiferromagnetic interaction. The model corresponds to the Rydberg (cold) atoms platform proposed for quantum annealing. We consistently find a very high relative accuracy for the ground state energy, around $10^{-5}$ for VMC and $10^{-6}$ for GFMC in all regimes of parameters, including in the vicinity of the quantum phase transition. We used very small ranks ($\sim 2-5$) of perceptrains, as opposed to multiples of thousand used in matrix product states. The optimization of the energy was robust with respect to the choice of initial conditions and hyper-parameters, in contrast to a common experience when using neural network wave functions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05050'&gt;arXiv:2506.05050&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 05 Jun 2025 13:57:48 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

Here, we establish a method to compute local topological invariants of exceptionally large systems using tensor networks, enabling the computation of invariants for Hamiltonians with hundreds of millions of sites, several orders of magnitude above the capabilities of conventional methodologies. Our approach leverages a tensor-network representation of the density matrix using a Chebyshev tensor network algorithm, enabling large-scale calculations of topological markers in quasicrystalline and moire systems. We demonstrate our methodology with two-dimensional quasicrystals featuring $C_8$ and $C_{10}$ rotational symmetries and mosaics of Chern phases.

      <title>A 2D-CFT Factory: Critical Lattice Models from Competing Anyon Condensation Processes in SymTO/SymTFT</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05324</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Ling-Yan Hung, Kaixin Ji, Ce Shen, Yidun Wan, Yu Zhao&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; In this paper, we introduce a ``CFT factory'' : a novel algorithm of methodically generating 2D lattice models that would flow to 2D conformal fixed points in the infrared. These 2D models are realised by giving critical boundary conditions to 3D topological orders (symTOs/symTFTs) described by string-net models, often called the strange correlators. We engineer these critical boundary conditions by introducing a commensurate amount of non-commuting anyon condensates. The non-invertible symmetries preserved at the critical point can be controlled by studying a novel ``refined condensation tree''. Our structured method generates an infinite family of critical lattice models, including the A-series minimal models, and uncovers previously unknown critical points. Notably, we find at least three novel critical points (c$\approx 1.3$, $1.8$, and $2.5$ respectively) preserving the Haagerup symmetries, in addition to recovering previously reported ones. The condensation tree, together with a generalised Kramers-Wannier duality, predicts precisely large swathes of phase boundaries, fixes almost completely the global phase diagram, and sieves out second order phase transitions. This is not only illustrated in well-known examples (such as the 8-vertex model related to the $A_5$ category) but also further verified with precision numerics, using our improved (non-invertible) symmetry-preserving tensor-network RG, in novel examples involving the Haagerup symmetries. We show that critical couplings can be precisely encoded in the categorical data (Frobenius algebras and quantum dimensions in unitary fusion categories), thus establishing a powerful, systematic route to discovering and potentially classifying new conformal field theories.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05324'&gt;arXiv:2506.05324&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 05 Jun 2025 17:58:04 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Compression, simulation, and synthesis of turbulent flows with tensor trains</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Stefano Pisoni, Raghavendra Dheeraj Peddinti, Egor Tiunov, Siddhartha E. Guzman, Leandro Aolita&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Numerical simulations of turbulent fluids are paramount to real-life applications, from predicting and modeling flows to diagnostic purposes in engineering. However, they are also computationally challenging due to their intrinsically non-linear dynamics, which requires a very high spatial resolution to accurately describe them. A promising idea is to represent flows on a discrete mesh using tensor trains (TTs), featuring a convenient scaling of the number of parameters with the mesh size. However, it is yet not clear how the compression power of TTs is affected by the complexity of the flows, measured by the Reynolds number. In fact, no TT fluid solver has been extensively validated in a fully developed turbulent regime yet. We fill this gap. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of TTs as an Ansatz to compress, simulate, and synthetically generate fiducial turbulent snapshots in 3D. Specifically, first, we exhaustively investigate the effect of TT compression of given snapshots on key turbulence signatures, including the energy spectrum and different accuracy metrics. Second, we present a TT solver to simulate time evolution of 3D fluid fields according to the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations entirely within the compressed representation. Third, we develop a TT algorithm to generate artificial snapshots displaying all the signatures of turbulence. In all three cases, a number of parameters scaling polylogarithmically with the mesh size is enough for accurate descriptions.

      <title>Real-time Estimators for Scattering Observables: A full account of finite volume errors for quantum simulation</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06511</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Ivan M. Burbano, Marco A. Carrillo, Rana Urek, Anthony N. Ciavarella, Raúl A. Briceño&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The real-time correlators of quantum field theories can be directly probed through new approaches to simulation, such as quantum computing and tensor networks. This provides a new framework for computing scattering observables in lattice formulations of strongly interacting theories, such as lattice quantum chromodynamics. In this paper, we prove that the proposal of real-time estimators of scattering observables is universally applicable to all scattering observables of gapped quantum field theories. All finite-volume errors are exponentially suppressed, and the rate of this suppression is controlled by the regulator considered, namely, a displacement of the spectrum of the theory into the complex plane. A partial restoration of Lorentz symmetry by averaging over different boosts gives an additional suppression of finite volume errors. Our results also apply to the simulation of wavepacket scattering, where a similar averaging is performed to construct the wavepackets that regulate the finite volume effects. We also comment on potential applications of our results to traditional computational schemes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06511'&gt;arXiv:2506.06511&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 06 Jun 2025 20:06:18 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Angular $k$-uniformity and the Hyperinvariance of Holographic Codes</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06577</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Wanli Cheng&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Holographic quantum error-correcting codes, often realized through tensor network architectures, have emerged as compelling toy models for exploring bulk-boundary duality in AdS-CFT. By encoding bulk information into highly entangled boundary degrees of freedom, they capture key features of holography such as subregion duality, operator reconstruction, and complementary recovery. Among them, hyperinvariant tensor networks-characterized by the inclusion of edge tensors and the enforcement of multi-tensor isometries-offer a promising platform for realizing features such as state dependence and nontrivial boundary correlations. However, existing constructions are largely confined to two-dimensional regular tilings, and the structural principles underlying hyperinvariance remain poorly understood, especially in higher dimensions. To address this, we introduce a geometric criterion called angular k-uniformity, which refines standard k-uniformity and its planar variants by requiring isometric behavior within angular sectors of a tensor's rotationally symmetric layout. This condition enables the systematic identification and construction of hyperinvariant holographic codes on regular hyperbolic honeycombs in arbitrary dimension, and extends naturally to heterogeneous networks and qLEGO architectures beyond regular tilings. Altogether, angular k-uniformity provides a versatile, geometry-aware framework for analyzing and designing holographic tensor networks and codes with hyperinvariant features such as nontrivial boundary correlations and state-dependent complementary recovery.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06577'&gt;arXiv:2506.06577&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 06 Jun 2025 23:08:13 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Emergent Holographic Spacetime from Quantum Information</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06595</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Tadashi Takayanagi&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Holographic duality describes gravitational theories in terms of quantum many-body systems. In holography, quantum information theory provides a crucial tool that directly connects microscopic structures of these systems to the geometries of gravitational spacetimes. One manifestation is that the entanglement entropy in quantum many-body systems can be calculated from the area of an extremal surface in the corresponding gravitational spacetime. This implies that a gravitational spacetime can emerge from an enormous number of entangled qubits. In this Essay, I will discuss open problems in this area of research, considering recent developments and outlining future prospects towards a complete understanding of quantum gravity. The first step in this direction is to understand what kind of quantum circuits each holographic spacetime corresponds to, drawing on recent developments in quantum complexity theories and studying concrete examples of holography in string theory. Next, we should extend the concept of holography to general spacetimes, e.g., those spacetimes which appear in realistic cosmologies, by utilizing the connections between quantum information and holography. To address the fundamental question of how time emerges, I will propose the concepts of pseudo-entropy and time-like entanglement as a useful tool in our exploration.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06595'&gt;arXiv:2506.06595&lt;/a&gt;] Published Sat, 07 Jun 2025 00:05:10 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Disorder and the Robustness of Superconductivity on the Flat Band</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07095</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Si Min Chan, Benoît Grémaud, G. George Batrouni&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We study the interplay between on-site disorder and fermion pairing on the quasi one-dimensional flat band Creutz lattice. Both disorder and flat bands localize particles, but an attractive interaction results in pair formation and delocalization giving rise to superconductivity. In this work, we examine the attractive Hubbard model on the Creutz lattice to study the competition between these two effects and elucidate the properties of the superconducting phase and the localization quantum phase transition as the disorder strength is increased. Our main result is that flat band superconductivity is robust against disorder: The critical disorder strength, $W_c$, required to localize the fermion pairs and destroy superconductivity, is finite at any interaction strength, $U$, and is proportional to the superconducting weight, $D_s$, of the clean system. Using large scale density matrix renormalization group computations, we show that this transition is of the BKT form. In addition, even at very small interaction strength, the localization is not due to single fermion localization but to pair localization. For completeness, we briefly study this disorder-induced localization with mean field theory and show that $W_c$ can be accurately determined by using an appropriate scaling function.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07095'&gt;arXiv:2506.07095&lt;/a&gt;] Published Sun, 08 Jun 2025 11:38:57 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>One-Shot Simulation of Static Disorder in Quantum Dynamics with Equilibrium Initial State via Matrix Product State Sampling</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07120</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Zhao Zhang, Jiajun Ren, Wei-Hai Fang&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Static disorder plays a crucial role in the electronic dynamics and spectroscopy of complex molecular systems. Traditionally, obtaining observables averaged over static disorder requires thousands of realizations via direct sampling of the disorder distribution, leading to high computational costs. In this work, we extend the auxiliary degree-of-freedom based matrix product state (MPS) method to handle system-bath correlated thermal equilibrium initial states. We validate the effectiveness of the extended method by computing the dipole-dipole time correlation function of the Holstein model relevant to the emission spectrum of molecular aggregates. Our results show that the method accurately captures static disorder effects using a one-shot quantum dynamical simulation, with only a moderate increase in MPS bond dimension, thereby significantly reducing computational cost. Moreover, it enables the generation of a much larger number of samples than the conventional direct sampling method at negligible additional cost, thus reducing statistical errors. This method provides a broadly useful tool for calculating equilibrium time correlation functions in system-bath coupled models with static disorder.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07120'&gt;arXiv:2506.07120&lt;/a&gt;] Published Sun, 08 Jun 2025 13:05:28 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Scaling up the transcorrelated density matrix renormalization group</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07441</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Benjamin Corbett, Akimasa Miyake&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Explicitly correlated methods, such as the transcorrelated method which shifts a Jastrow or Gutzwiller correlator from the wave function to the Hamiltonian, are designed for high-accuracy calculations of electronic structures, but their application to larger systems has been hampered by the computational cost. We develop improved techniques for the transcorrelated density matrix renormalization group (DMRG), in which the ground state of the transcorrelated Hamiltonian is represented as a matrix product state (MPS), and demonstrate large-scale calculations of the ground-state energy of the two-dimensional Fermi-Hubbard model. Our developments stem from three technical inventions: (i) constructing matrix product operators (MPO) of transcorrelated Hamiltonians with low bond dimension and high sparsity, (ii) exploiting the entanglement structure of the ground states to increase the accuracy of the MPS representation, and (iii) optimizing the non-linear parameter of the Gutzwiller correlator to mitigate the non-variational nature of the transcorrelated method. We examine systems of size up to $12 \times 12$ lattice sites, four times larger than previous transcorrelated DMRG studies, and demonstrate that transcorrelated DMRG yields significant improvements over standard non-transcorrelated DMRG for equivalent computational effort. Transcorrelated DMRG reduces the error of the ground state energy by $3\times$-$17 \times$, with the smallest improvement seen for a small system at half-filling and the largest improvement in a dilute closed-shell system.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07441'&gt;arXiv:2506.07441&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 09 Jun 2025 05:36:59 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Microscopic Mechanism of Anyon Superconductivity Emerging from Fractional Chern Insulators</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08000</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Fabian Pichler, Clemens Kuhlenkamp, Michael Knap, Ashvin Vishwanath&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Fractional quantum Hall (FQH) states and superconductors typically require contrasting conditions, yet recent experiments have observed them in the same device. A natural explanation is that mobile anyons give rise to superconductivity; however, this mechanism requires binding of minimally charged anyons to establish an unusual energy hierarchy. This scenario has mostly been studied with effective theories, leaving open the question of how anyon superconductivity can arise from repulsive interactions. Here, we show that such an energy hierarchy of anyons arises naturally in fractional Chern insulators (FCIs) at fillings $\nu = 2/(4p \mp 1)$ when they are driven toward a quantum phase transition into a ``semion crystal'' -- an exotic charge-density-wave (CDW) insulator with semion topological order. Near the transition, Cooper-pair correlations are enhanced, so that a conventional charge-2e superconductor appears with doping. Guided by these insights, we analyze a microscopic realization in a repulsive Hubbard-Hofstadter model. Tensor network simulations at $\nu = 2/3$ reveal a robust FCI that, with increasing interactions, transitions into the semion crystal. Finding a stable semion crystal in such a minimal model highlights it as a viable state competing with conventional CDW and FQH states. In the vicinity of this transition, we find markedly enhanced Cooper pairing, consistent with our theory that the 2e/3 anyon is cheaper than a pair of isolated e/3 anyons. Doping near the transition should in general lead to doping Cooper pairs and charge-2e superconductivity, with chiral edge modes of alternating central charge $c = \pm2$, which can coexist with translation symmetry breaking. Our framework unifies recent approaches to anyon superconductivity, reconciles it with strong repulsion and provides guidance for flat band moir\'e materials such as recent experiments in twisted MoTe$_2$.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08000'&gt;arXiv:2506.08000&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 09 Jun 2025 17:59:13 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Neuralized Fermionic Tensor Networks for Quantum Many-Body Systems</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Si-Jing Du, Garnet Kin-Lic Chan&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We describe a class of neuralized fermionic tensor network states (NN-fTNS) that introduce non-linearity into fermionic tensor networks through configuration-dependent neural network transformations of the local tensors. The construction uses the fTNS algebra to implement a natural fermionic sign structure and is compatible with standard tensor network algorithms, but gains enhanced expressivity through the neural network parametrization. Using the 1D and 2D Fermi-Hubbard models as benchmarks, we demonstrate that NN-fTNS achieve order of magnitude improvements in the ground-state energy compared to pure fTNS with the same bond dimension, and can be systematically improved through both the tensor network bond dimension and the neural network parametrization. Compared to existing fermionic neural quantum states (NQS) based on Slater determinants and Pfaffians, NN-fTNS offer a physically motivated alternative fermionic structure. Furthermore, compared to such states, NN-fTNS naturally exhibit improved computational scaling and we demonstrate a construction that achieves linear scaling with the lattice size.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08329'&gt;arXiv:2506.08329&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 10 Jun 2025 01:33:58 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Matrix Product State on a Quantum Computer</title>

Currently, as a hardware-friendly computational paradigms, variational algorithms are often used for finding the ground energy of quantum many-body systems. However, running large-scale variational algorithms is challenging, because of the noise as well as the obstacle of barren plateaus. In this work, we propose the quantum version of matrix product state (qMPS), and develop variational quantum algorithms to prepare it in canonical forms, allowing to run the variational MPS method, which is equivalent to the Density Matrix Renormalization Group method, on near term quantum devices. Compared with widely used methods such as variational quantum eigensolver, this method can greatly reduce the number of qubits used in local optimization, and thus mitigate the effects of barren plateaus while obtaining better accuracy. Our method holds promise for distributed quantum computing, offering possibilities for fusion of different computing systems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08395'&gt;arXiv:2506.08395&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 10 Jun 2025 03:06:59 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>MetaTT: A Global Tensor-Train Adapter for Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09105</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Javier Lopez-Piqueres, Pranav Deshpande, Archan Ray, Mattia J. Villani, Marco Pistoia, Niraj Kumar&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We present MetaTT, a unified Tensor Train (TT) adapter framework for global low-rank fine-tuning of pre-trained transformers. Unlike LoRA, which fine-tunes each weight matrix independently, MetaTT uses a single shared TT to factorize all transformer sub-modules -- query, key, value, projection, and feed-forward layers -- by indexing the structural axes like layer and matrix type, and optionally heads and tasks. For a given rank, while LoRA adds parameters proportional to the product across modes, MetaTT only adds parameters proportional to the sum across modes leading to a significantly compressed final adapter. Our benchmarks compare MetaTT with LoRA along with recent state-of-the-art matrix and tensor decomposition based fine-tuning schemes. We observe that when tested on standard language modeling benchmarks, MetaTT leads to the most reduction in the parameters while maintaining similar accuracy to LoRA and even outperforming other tensor-based methods. Unlike CP or other rank-factorizations, the TT ansatz benefits from mature optimization routines -- e.g., DMRG-style rank adaptive minimization in addition to Adam, which we find simplifies training. Because new modes can be appended cheaply, MetaTT naturally extends to shared adapters across many tasks without redesigning the core tensor.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09105'&gt;arXiv:2506.09105&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 10 Jun 2025 16:32:05 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

One of the significant issues is to prepare and manipulate the ground state as well as excited states in a quantum simulator. Here, we provide a protocol to manipulate the Kitaev quantum spin liquid via digital quantum simulation. A series of unitary gates for the protocol is explicitly constructed, showing its circuit depth is an order of $\mathcal{O}(N)$ with the number of qubits, N. We demonstrate the efficiency of our protocol on the IBM Heron r2 processor for N = 8 and 12. We further validate our theoretical framework through numerical simulations, confirming high-fidelity quantum state control for system sizes up to N = 450, and discuss the possible implications of these results.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09156'&gt;arXiv:2506.09156&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 10 Jun 2025 18:09:17 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

In this paper, we provide a systematic lattice model construction for all such gapped phases. Specifically, we consider ``All boson type" fusion 2-category symmetries, all of which are obtainable from 0-form symmetry groups $G$ (possibly with an 't Hooft anomaly) via generalized gauging--that is, by stacking with an $H$-symmetric TFT and gauging a subgroup $H$. The continuum classification directly informs the lattice data, such as the generalized gauging that determines the symmetry category, and the data that specifies the gapped phase. We construct commuting projector Hamiltonians and ground states applicable to any non-chiral gapped phase with such symmetries. We also describe the ground states in terms of tensor networks. In light of the length of the paper, we include a self-contained summary section presenting the main results and examples.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09177'&gt;arXiv:2506.09177&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 10 Jun 2025 18:44:46 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

Farajollahpour&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; This report offers a comprehensive analysis of the evolving landscape of quantum algorithm software specifically tailored for condensed matter physics. It examines fundamental quantum algorithms such as Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE), Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE), Quantum Annealing (QA), Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA), and Quantum Machine Learning (QML) as applied to key condensed matter problems including strongly correlated systems, topological phases, and quantum magnetism. This review details leading software development kits (SDKs) like Qiskit, Cirq, PennyLane, and Q\#, and profiles key academic, commercial, and governmental initiatives driving innovation in this domain.

      <title>Entanglement structure for finite system under dual-unitary dynamics</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09904</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Gaurav Rudra Malik, Rohit Kumar Shukla, Sudhanva Joshi, S. Aravinda, Sunil Kumar Mishra&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The dynamics of quantum many-body systems in the chaotic regime are of particular interest due to the associated phenomena of information scrambling and entanglement generation within the system. While these systems are typically intractable using traditional numerical methods, an effective framework can be implemented based on dual-unitary circuits which have emerged as a minimal model for maximally chaotic dynamics. In this work, we investigate how individual two-body operators influence the global dynamics of circuits composed of dual-unitaries. We study their effect on entanglement generation while examining it from both bipartite and multipartite perspectives. Here we also highlight the significant role of local unitaries in the dynamics when paired with operators from the dual-unitary class, showing that systems with identical entangling power can exhibit a range of differing entanglement growth rates. Furthermore, we present calculations establishing time-step-dependent lower bounds, which depend on both the initial state and the entangling power of the constituent operators. Finally, we find that time-evolving an initial state composed of pair products generates a state with nearly maximal multipartite entanglement content, approaching the bounds established by Absolutely Maximally Entangled (AME) states.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09904'&gt;arXiv:2506.09904&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 11 Jun 2025 16:17:17 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Hollow-grams: Generalized Entanglement Wedges from the Gravitational Path Integral</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10064</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Sami Kaya, Pratik Rath, Kyle Ritchie&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Recently, Bousso and Penington (BP) made a proposal for the entanglement wedge associated to a gravitating bulk region. In this paper, we derive this proposal in time-reflection symmetric settings using the gravitational path integral. To do this, we exploit the connection between random tensor networks (RTNs) and fixed-geometry states in gravity. We define the entropy of a bulk region in an RTN by removing tensors in that region and computing the entropy of the open legs thus generated in the "hollowed" RTN. We thus derive the BP proposal for RTNs and hence, also for fixed-geometry states in gravity. By then expressing a general holographic state as a superposition over fixed-geometry states and using a diagonal approximation, we provide a general gravitational path integral derivation of the BP proposal. We demonstrate that the saddles computing the R\'enyi entropy $S_n$ depend on how the bulk region is gauge-invariantly specified. Nevertheless, we show that the BP proposal is universally reproduced in the $n\to1$ limit.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10064'&gt;arXiv:2506.10064&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 11 Jun 2025 18:00:00 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Entanglement Holography in Quantum Phases via Twisted Rényi-N Correlators</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10076</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Pablo Sala, Frank Pollmann, Masaki Oshikawa, Yizhi You&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We introduce a holographic framework for the entanglement Hamiltonian in symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases with area-law entanglement, whose reduced density matrix $\rho \propto e^{-H_e}$ can be treated as a lower-dimensional mixed state. By replicating $\rho$, we reconstruct the fixed-point SPT wavefunction, establishing an exact correspondence between the bulk strange correlator of the (d+1)-dimensional SPT state and the twisted R\'enyi-N operator of the d-dimensional reduced density matrix. Notably, the reduced density matrix exhibits long-range or quasi-long-range order along the replica direction, revealing a universal entanglement feature in SPT phases. As a colloary, we generalized the framework of twisted R\'enyi-N correlator to thermal states and open quantum systems, providing an alternative formulation of the Lieb-Schultz-Mattis theorem, applicable to both closed and open systems. Finally, we extend our protocol to mixed-state SPT phases and introduce new quantum information metrics -- twisted R\'enyi-N correlators of the surgery operator -- to characterize the topology of mixed states.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10076'&gt;arXiv:2506.10076&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 11 Jun 2025 18:00:22 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Worldline deconfinement and emergent long-range interaction in entanglement Hamiltonian and entanglement spectrum</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10078</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Zenan Liu, Zhe Wang, Dao-Xin Yao, Zheng Yan&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; When a system exhibits a bulk gap but gapless edge states (e.g., a symmetry-protected topological phase), the entanglement spectrum (ES) resembles the energy spectrum on virtual edge, that is the Li-Haldane conjecture. In this way, the ES plays an important probe to detect the topological phases according to this bulk-edge correspondence. When a system is fully gapped, both in bulk and edge, the ES still remains similar to the virtual edge spectrum which can be explained by the recently proposed wormhole effect in the path integral of reduced density matrix. However, what will happen in the ES when the system is fully gapless? We find that though the ES roughly seems like an edge energy spectrum, and it actually contains relevant long-range interaction which modifies the intrinsic physics of entanglement Hamiltonian (EH). Moreover, the mechanism of short-/long-range interaction in EH can be understood as the confinement/deconfinement of worldlines in a path integral of reduced density matrix. Our work demonstrates that the gapless mode can induce a long-range interaction in EH.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10078'&gt;arXiv:2506.10078&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 11 Jun 2025 18:00:36 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Coupled Lindblad pseudomode theory for simulating open quantum systems</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Zhen Huang, Gunhee Park, Garnet Kin-Lic Chan, Lin Lin&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Coupled Lindblad pseudomode theory is a promising approach for simulating non-Markovian quantum dynamics on both classical and quantum platforms, with dynamics that can be realized as a quantum channel. We provide theoretical evidence that the number of coupled pseudomodes only needs to scale as $\mathrm{polylog}(T/\varepsilon)$ in the simulation time $T$ and precision $\varepsilon$. Inspired by the realization problem in control theory, we also develop a robust numerical algorithm for constructing the coupled modes that avoids the non-convex optimization required by existing approaches. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by computing population dynamics and absorption spectra for the spin-boson model. This work provides a significant theoretical and computational improvement to the coupled Lindblad framework, which impacts a broad range of applications from classical simulations of quantum impurity problems to quantum simulations on near-term quantum platforms.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10308'&gt;arXiv:2506.10308&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 12 Jun 2025 02:40:39 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Multi-entropy and the Dihedral Measures at Quantum Critical Points</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Jonathan Harper, Ali Mollabashi, Tadashi Takayanagi, Kenya Tasuki&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The multi-entropy and dihedral measures are a class of tractable measures for multi-partite entanglement, which are labeled by the R\'enyi index (or replica number) $n$ as in the R\'enyi entanglement entropy. The purpose of this article is to demonstrate that these quantities are new useful probes of quantum critical points by examining concrete examples. In particular, we compute the multi-entropy and dihedral measures in the $1+1$ dimensional massless free scalar field theory on a lattice and in the transverse-field Ising model. For $n=2$, we find that the numerical results in both lattice theories quantitatively agree with those from conformal field theoretic calculations. For $n=3$ and $n=4$, we provide new predictions of these measures for the massless scalar field theory.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10396'&gt;arXiv:2506.10396&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 12 Jun 2025 06:37:52 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Kibble-Zurek dynamical scaling hypothesis in the Google analog-digital quantum simulator of the $XX$ model</title>

Bayocboc Jr., Jacek Dziarmaga&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The state-of-the-art tensor networks are employed to simulate the Hamiltonian ramp in the analog-digital quantum simulation of the quantum phase transition to the quasi-long-range ordered phase of the 2D square-lattice $XX$ model [Nature 638, 79 (2025)]. We focus on the quantum Kibble-Zurek (KZ) mechanism near the quantum critical point. Using the infinite projected entangled pair state (iPEPS), we simulate an infinite lattice and demonstrate the KZ scaling hypothesis for the $XX$ correlations across a wide range of ramp times. We use the time-dependent variational principle (TDVP) algorithm to simulate a finite $8\times 8$ lattice, similar to the one in the quantum simulation, and find that adiabatic finite-size effects dominate for longer ramp times, where the correlation length's growth with increasing ramp time saturates and the excitation energy's dependence on the ramp time crosses over to a power-law decay characteristic of adiabatic transitions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10771'&gt;arXiv:2506.10771&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 12 Jun 2025 14:50:12 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Free Probability in a Minimal Quantum Circuit Model</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Felix Fritzsch, Pieter W. Claeys&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Recent experimental and theoretical developments in many-body quantum systems motivate the study of their out-of-equilibrium properties through multi-time correlation functions. We consider the dynamics of higher-order out-of-time-order correlators (OTOCs) in a minimal circuit model for quantum dynamics. This model mimics the dynamics of a structured subsystem locally coupled to a maximally random environment. We prove the exponential decay of all higher-order OTOCs and fully characterize the relevant time scales, showing how local operators approach free independence at late times. We show that the effects of the environment on the local subsystem can be captured in a higher-order influence matrix, which allows for a Markovian description of the dynamics provided an auxiliary degree of freedom is introduced. This degree of freedom directly yields a dynamical picture for the OTOCs in terms of free cumulants from free probability, consistent with recent predictions from the full eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH). This approach and the relevant influence matrix are expected to be applicable in more general settings and present a first step to characterizing quantum memory in higher-order OTOCs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11197'&gt;arXiv:2506.11197&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 12 Jun 2025 18:00:11 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Quantum Fisher information from tensor network integration of Lyapunov equation</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11330</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Gabriela Wójtowicz, Susana F. Huelga, Marek M. Rams, Martin B. Plenio&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The Quantum Fisher Information (QFI) is a geometric measure of state deformation calculated along the trajectory parameterizing an ensemble of quantum states. It serves as a key concept in quantum metrology, where it is linked to the fundamental limit on the precision of the parameter that we estimate. However, the QFI is notoriously difficult to calculate due to its non-linear mathematical form. For mixed states, standard numerical procedures based on eigendecomposition quickly become impractical with increasing system size. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a novel numerical approach based on Lyapunov integrals that combines the concept of symmetric logarithmic derivative and tensor networks. Importantly, this approach requires only the elementary matrix product states algorithm for time-evolution, opening a perspective for broad usage and application to many-body systems. We discuss the advantages and limitations of our methodology through an illustrative example in quantum metrology, where the thermal state of the transverse-field Ising model is used to measure magnetic field amplitude.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11330'&gt;arXiv:2506.11330&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 12 Jun 2025 22:01:31 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>The Integral Decimation Method for Quantum Dynamics and Statistical Mechanics</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11341</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Ryan T. Grimm, Alexander J. Staat, Joel D. Eaves&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The solutions to many problems in the mathematical, computational, and physical sciences often involve multidimensional integrals. A direct numerical evaluation of the integral incurs a computational cost that is exponential in the number of dimensions, a phenomenon called the curse of dimensionality. The problem is so substantial that one usually employs sampling methods, like Monte Carlo, to avoid integration altogether. Here, we derive and implement a quantum algorithm to compress a multidimensional integrand into a product of matrix-valued functions - a spectral tensor train - changing the computational complexity of integration from exponential to polynomial. The algorithm compresses the integrand by applying a sequence of quantum gates to an unentangled quantum state, where each term corresponds to a body-ordered term in the potential. Because it allows for the systematic elimination of small contributions to the integral through decimation, we call the method integral decimation. The functions in the spectral basis are analytically differentiable and integrable, and in applications to the partition function, integral decimation numerically factorizes an interacting system into a product of noninteracting ones. We illustrate integral decimation by evaluating the absolute free energy and entropy of a chiral XY model as a continuous function of temperature. We also compute the nonequilibrium time-dependent reduced density matrix of a quantum chain with between two and forty levels, each coupled to colored noise. When other methods provide numerical solutions to these models, they quantitatively agree with integral decimation. When conventional methods become intractable, integral decimation can be a powerful alternative.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11341'&gt;arXiv:2506.11341&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 12 Jun 2025 22:26:12 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

These methods provide an exact equation which returns the optimal solution of the problems. As in other tensor network algorithms for combinatorial optimization problems, the method is based on imaginary time evolution and the implementation of restrictions in the tensor network. In addition, we introduce the use of symmetries and the reutilization of intermediate calculations, reducing the computational complexity for both problems. To show the efficiency of our implementations, we carry out some performance experiments and compare the results with those obtained by other classical algorithms.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11711'&gt;arXiv:2506.11711&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 13 Jun 2025 12:27:34 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Improved Ground State Estimation in Quantum Field Theories via Normalising Flow-Assisted Neural Quantum States</title>

Ngairangbam, Michael Spannowsky, Timur Sypchenko&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We propose a hybrid variational framework that enhances Neural Quantum States (NQS) with a Normalising Flow-based sampler to improve the expressivity and trainability of quantum many-body wavefunctions. Our approach decouples the sampling task from the variational ansatz by learning a continuous flow model that targets a discretised, amplitude-supported subspace of the Hilbert space. This overcomes limitations of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and autoregressive methods, especially in regimes with long-range correlations and volume-law entanglement. Applied to the transverse-field Ising model with both short- and long-range interactions, our method achieves comparable ground state energy errors with state-of-the-art matrix product states and lower energies than autoregressive NQS. For systems up to 50 spins, we demonstrate high accuracy and robust convergence across a wide range of coupling strengths, including regimes where competing methods fail. Our results showcase the utility of flow-assisted sampling as a scalable tool for quantum simulation and offer a new approach toward learning expressive quantum states in high-dimensional Hilbert spaces.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12128'&gt;arXiv:2506.12128&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 13 Jun 2025 18:00:01 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

Focusing on the XXZ spin chain initialized in domain-wall state, we demonstrate universal power-law growth of both PE and SRE, with scaling exponents explicitly reflecting the underlying transport regimes, ballistic, diffusive, or KPZ-type superdiffusive.

      <title>Simulating the Antiferromagnetic Heisenberg Model on a Spin-Frustrated Kagome Lattice with the Contextual Subspace Variational Quantum Eigensolver</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12391</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Tim Weaving, Alexis Ralli, Vinul Wimalaweera, Peter J. Love, Peter V. Coveney&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; In this work we investigate the ground state properties of a candidate quantum spin liquid using a superconducting Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) device. Specifically, we study the antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model on a Kagome lattice, a geometrically frustrated structure that gives rise to a highly degenerate energy spectrum. To successfully simulate this system, we employ a qubit reduction strategy leveraging the Contextual Subspace methodology, significantly reducing the problem size prior to execution on the quantum device. We improve the quality of these subspaces by using the wavefunctions obtained from low bond dimension Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) calculations to bias the subspace stabilizers through a symplectic approximate symmetry generator extraction algorithm. Reducing the Hamiltonian size allows us to implement tiled circuit ensembles and deploy the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) to estimate the ground state energy. We adopt a hybrid quantum error mitigation strategy combining Readout Error Mitigation (REM), Symmetry Verification (SV) and Zero Noise Extrapolation (ZNE). This approach yields high-accuracy energy estimates, achieving error rates on the order of 0.01% and thus demonstrating the potential of near-term quantum devices for probing frustrated quantum materials.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12391'&gt;arXiv:2506.12391&lt;/a&gt;] Published Sat, 14 Jun 2025 08:01:34 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Accelerated Inchworm Method with Tensor-Train Bath Influence Functional</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12410</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Geshuo Wang, Yixiao Sun, Siyao Yang, Zhenning Cai&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We propose an efficient tensor-train-based algorithm for simulating open quantum systems with the inchworm method, where the reduced dynamics of the open quantum system is expressed as a perturbative series of high-dimensional integrals. Instead of evaluating the integrals with Monte Carlo methods, we approximate the costly bath influence functional (BIF) in the integrand as a tensor train, allowing accurate deterministic numerical quadrature schemes implemented in an iterative manner. Thanks to the low-rank structure of the tensor train, our proposed method has a complexity that scales linearly with the number of dimensions. Our method couples seamlessly with the tensor transfer method, allowing long-time simulations of the dynamics.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12410'&gt;arXiv:2506.12410&lt;/a&gt;] Published Sat, 14 Jun 2025 09:05:42 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>The Software Landscape for the Density Matrix Renormalization Group</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12629</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Per Sehlstedt, Jan Brandejs, Paolo Bientinesi, Lars Karlsson&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) algorithm is a cornerstone computational method for studying quantum many-body systems, renowned for its accuracy and adaptability. Despite DMRG's broad applicability across fields such as materials science, quantum chemistry, and quantum computing, numerous independent implementations have been developed. This survey maps the rapidly expanding DMRG software landscape, providing a comprehensive comparison of features among 35 existing packages. We found significant overlap in features among the packages when comparing key aspects, such as parallelism strategies for high-performance computing and symmetry-adapted formulations that enhance efficiency. This overlap suggests opportunities for modularization of common operations, including tensor operations, symmetry representations, and eigensolvers, as the packages are mostly independent and share few third-party library dependencies where functionality is factored out. More widespread modularization and standardization would result in reduced duplication of efforts and improved interoperability. We believe that the proliferation of packages and the current lack of standard interfaces and modularity are more social than technical. We aim to raise awareness of existing packages, guide researchers in finding a suitable package for their needs, and help developers identify opportunities for collaboration, modularity standardization, and optimization. Ultimately, this work emphasizes the value of greater cohesion and modularity, which would benefit DMRG software, allowing these powerful algorithms to tackle more complex and ambitious problems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12629'&gt;arXiv:2506.12629&lt;/a&gt;] Published Sat, 14 Jun 2025 21:12:16 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Diagnosing 2D symmetry protected topological states via mixed state anomaly</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13096</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Chao Xu, Yunlong Zang, Yixin Ma, Yingfei Gu, Shenghan Jiang&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases are short-range entangled quantum states characterized by anomalous edge behavior, a manifestation of the bulk-boundary correspondence for topological phases. Moreover, the Li-Haldane conjecture posits that the entanglement spectrum exhibits the same anomaly as the physical edge spectrum, thereby serving as an entanglement-based fingerprint for identifying topological phases. In this work, we extend the entanglement-based diagnostic tools by demonstrating that the edge anomaly is manifested not only in the entanglement spectrum but also in the reduced density matrix itself, a phenomenon we refer to as the mixed state anomaly. Focusing on the two-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_2$ SPT phase, we show that this anomaly is subtly encoded in symmetry-twisted mixed states, leading to a topological contribution to the disorder parameter beyond the area law, as well as a spontaneous-symmetry-breaking type long-range order when time reversal symmetry is present.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13096'&gt;arXiv:2506.13096&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 16 Jun 2025 05:00:03 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Scalable Simulation of Quantum Many-Body Dynamics with Or-Represented Quantum Algebra</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Lukas Broers, Rong-Yang Sun, Seiji Yunoki&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; High-performance numerical methods are essential not only for advancing quantum many-body physics but also for enabling integration with emerging quantum computing platforms. We present a scalable and general-purpose parallel algorithm for quantum simulations based on or-represented quantum algebra (ORQA). This framework applies to arbitrary spin systems and naturally integrates with quantum circuit simulation in the Heisenberg picture, particularly relevant to recent large-scale experiments on superconducting qubit processors [Kim et al., Nature 618, 500 (2023)]. As a benchmark, we simulate the kicked Ising model on a 127-qubit heavy-hexagon lattice, tracking the time evolution of local magnetization using up to one trillion Pauli strings. Executed on the supercomputer Fugaku, our simulations exhibit strong scaling up to $2^{17}$ parallel processes with near-linear communication overhead. These results establish ORQA as a practical and high-performance tool for quantum many-body dynamics, and highlight its potential for integration into hybrid quantum-classical computational frameworks, complementing recent advances in tensor-network and surrogate simulation techniques.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13241'&gt;arXiv:2506.13241&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 16 Jun 2025 08:41:54 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Compressing local vertex functions from the multipoint numerical renormalization group using quantics tensor cross interpolation</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13359</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Markus Frankenbach, Marc Ritter, Mathias Pelz, Nepomuk Ritz, Jan von Delft, Anxiang Ge&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The multipoint numerical renormalization group (mpNRG) is a powerful impurity solver that provides accurate spectral data useful for computing local, dynamic correlation functions in imaginary or real frequencies non-perturbatively across a wide range of interactions and temperatures. It gives access to a local, non-perturbative four-point vertex in imaginary and real frequencies, which can be used as input for subsequent computations such as diagrammatic extensions of dynamical mean--field theory. However, computing and manipulating the real-frequency four-point vertex on large, dense grids quickly becomes numerically challenging when the density and/or the extent of the frequency grid is increased. In this paper, we compute four-point vertices in a strongly compressed quantics tensor train format using quantics tensor cross interpolation, starting from discrete partial spectral functions obtained from mpNRG. This enables evaluations of the vertex on frequency grids with resolutions far beyond the reach of previous implementations. We benchmark this approach on the four-point vertex of the single-impurity Anderson model across a wide range of physical parameters, both in its full form and its asymptotic decomposition. For imaginary frequencies, the full vertex can be represented to an accuracy on the order of $2\cdot 10^{-3}$ with maximum bond dimensions not exceeding 120. The more complex full real-frequency vertex requires maximum bond dimensions not exceeding 170 for an accuracy of $\lesssim 2\%$. Our work marks another step toward tensor-train-based diagrammatic calculations for correlated electronic lattice models starting from a local, non-perturbative mpNRG vertex.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13359'&gt;arXiv:2506.13359&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 16 Jun 2025 11:00:05 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Entanglement-minimized orbitals enable faster quantum simulation of molecules</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13386</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Zhendong Li&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Quantum computation offers significant potential for accelerating the simulation of molecules and materials through algorithms such as quantum phase estimation (QPE). However, the expected speedup in ground-state energy estimation depends critically on the ability to efficiently prepare an initial state with high overlap with the true ground state. For strongly correlated molecules such as iron-sulfur clusters, this overlap is demonstrated to decay exponentially with system size. To alleviate this problem, we introduce an efficient classical algorithm to find entanglement-minimized orbitals (EMOs) using spin-adapted matrix product states (MPS) with small bond dimensions. The EMO basis yields a more compact ground-state representation, significantly easing initial state preparation for challenging systems. Our algorithm improves initial state overlap by nearly an order of magnitude over prior orbital optimization approaches for an iron-sulfur cluster with four irons, and is scalable to larger systems with many unpaired electrons, including the P-cluster and FeMo-cofactor in nitrogenase with eight transition metal centers. For these systems, we achieve substantial enhancements on initial state overlap by factors of $O(10^2)$ and $O(10^5)$, respectively, compared to results obtained using localized orbitals. Our results show that initial state preparation for these challenging systems requires far fewer resources than prior estimates suggested.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13386'&gt;arXiv:2506.13386&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 16 Jun 2025 11:49:20 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Excitations and dynamical structure factor of $J_1-J_2$ spin-$3/2$ and spin-$5/2$ Heisenberg spin chains</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13431</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Aman Sharma, Mithilesh Nayak, Natalia Chepiga, Frédéric Mila&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We study the dynamical structure factor of the frustrated spin-$3/2$ $J_1$-$J_2$ Heisenberg chains, with particular focus on the partially dimerized phase that emerges between two Kosterlitz-Thouless transitions. Using a valence bond solid ansatz corroborated by density matrix renormalization group simulations, we investigate the nature of magnon and spinon excitations through the single-mode approximation. We show that the magnon develops an incommensurate dispersion at $J_2 \approx 0.32J_1$, while the spinons, viewed as domain walls between degenerate valence bond solid states, become incommensurate at $J_2 \approx 0.4J_1$ beyond the Lifshitz point ($J_2 \approx 0.388J_1$). The dynamical structure factor exhibits rich spectral features shaped by the interplay between these excitations, with magnons appearing as resonances embedded in the spinon continuum. The spinon gap shows a nonmonotonic behavior, reaching a peak near the center of the partially dimerized phase and closing at the boundaries, suggesting the appearance of a floating phase as a result of the condensation of incommensurate spinons. Comparative analysis with the spin-$5/2$ case confirms the universality of these phenomena across half-integer higher-spin systems. Our results provide detailed insight into how fractionalization and incommensurate condensation govern the spectral properties of frustrated spin chains, offering a unified picture across different spin magnitudes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13431'&gt;arXiv:2506.13431&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 16 Jun 2025 12:47:59 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>TensorSLM: Energy-efficient Embedding Compression of Sub-billion Parameter Language Models on Low-end Devices</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13514</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Mingxue Xu, Yao Lei Xu, Danilo P. Mandic&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Small Language Models (SLMs, or on-device LMs) have significantly fewer parameters than Large Language Models (LLMs). They are typically deployed on low-end devices, like mobile phones and single-board computers. Unlike LLMs, which rely on increasing model size for better generalisation, SLMs designed for edge applications are expected to have adaptivity to the deployment environments and energy efficiency given the device battery life constraints, which are not addressed in datacenter-deployed LLMs. This paper addresses these two requirements by proposing a training-free token embedding compression approach using Tensor-Train Decomposition (TTD). Each pre-trained token embedding vector is converted into a lower-dimensional Matrix Product State (MPS). We comprehensively evaluate the extracted low-rank structures across compression ratio, language task performance, latency, and energy consumption on a typical low-end device, i.e. Raspberry Pi. Taking the sub-billion parameter versions of GPT-2/Cerebres-GPT and OPT models as examples, our approach achieves a comparable language task performance to the original model with around $2.0\times$ embedding layer compression, while the energy consumption of a single query drops by half.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13514'&gt;arXiv:2506.13514&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 16 Jun 2025 14:09:43 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>High-expressibility Quantum Neural Networks using only classical resources</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Marco Maronese, Francesco Ferrari, Matteo Vandelli, Daniele Dragoni&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Quantum neural networks (QNNs), as currently formulated, are near-term quantum machine learning architectures that leverage parameterized quantum circuits with the aim of improving upon the performance of their classical counterparts. In this work, we show that some desired properties attributed to these models can be efficiently reproduced without necessarily resorting to quantum hardware. We indeed study the expressibility of parametrized quantum circuit commonly used in QNN applications and contrast it to those of two classes of states that can be efficiently simulated classically: matrix-product states (MPS), and Clifford-enhanced MPS (CMPS), obtained by applying a set of Clifford gates to MPS. In addition to expressibility, we assess the level of primary quantum resources, entanglement and non-stabilizerness (a.k.a. "magic"), in random ensembles of such quantum states, tracking their convergence to the Haar distribution. While MPS require a large number of parameters to reproduce an arbitrary quantum state, we find that CMPS approach the Haar distribution more rapidly, in terms of both entanglement and magic. Our results indicate that high expressibility in QNNs is attainable with purely classical resources.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13605'&gt;arXiv:2506.13605&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 16 Jun 2025 15:29:28 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Enhancing Symbolic Machine Learning by Subsymbolic Representations</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14569</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Stephen Roth, Lennart Baur, Derian Boer, Stefan Kramer&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The goal of neuro-symbolic AI is to integrate symbolic and subsymbolic AI approaches, to overcome the limitations of either. Prominent systems include Logic Tensor Networks (LTN) or DeepProbLog, which offer neural predicates and end-to-end learning. The versatility of systems like LTNs and DeepProbLog, however, makes them less efficient in simpler settings, for instance, for discriminative machine learning, in particular in domains with many constants. Therefore, we follow a different approach: We propose to enhance symbolic machine learning schemes by giving them access to neural embeddings. In the present paper, we show this for TILDE and embeddings of constants used by TILDE in similarity predicates. The approach can be fine-tuned by further refining the embeddings depending on the symbolic theory. In experiments in three real-world domain, we show that this simple, yet effective, approach outperforms all other baseline methods in terms of the F1 score. The approach could be useful beyond this setting: Enhancing symbolic learners in this way could be extended to similarities between instances (effectively working like kernels within a logical language), for analogical reasoning, or for propositionalization.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14569'&gt;arXiv:2506.14569&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 17 Jun 2025 14:26:21 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

Kleijweg, Philippe Corboz&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; SU(N) Hubbard models exhibit a rich variety of phases, which may be realized through quantum simulation with ultracold atomic gases in optical lattices. In this work we study the Mott insulating phases of the SU(3) Hubbard model at 1/3-filling using infinite projected entangled-pair states, optimized with both imaginary time evolution and variational optimization. In the limit of strong interactions we reproduce the antiferromagnetic 3-sublattice ordered state previously identified in the SU(3) Heisenberg model. At intermediate interaction strength we find antiferromagnetic states exhibiting zigzag patterns of different lengths, in agreement with previous Hartree-Fock and constrained-path auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo calculations. We study the color order parameter and energy anisotropy, which are discontinuous across the phase transitions. Finally, we analyze the different energy contributions in two competing phases, identifying low-energy bonds at the corners of the zigzag that help stabilize the zigzag states.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14703'&gt;arXiv:2506.14703&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 17 Jun 2025 16:41:01 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Path Integral Monte Carlo in the Angular Momentum Basis for a Chain of Planar Rotors</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Estêvão de Oliveira, Muhammad Shaeer Moeed, Pierre-Nicholas Roy&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We introduce a Path Integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) approach that uses the angular momentum representation for the description of interacting rotor systems. Such a choice of representation allows the calculation of momentum properties without having to break the paths. The discrete nature of the momentum basis also allows the use of rejection-free Gibbs sampling techniques. To illustrate the method, we study the collective behavior of $N$ confined planar rotors with dipole-dipole interactions, a system known to exhibit a quantum phase transition from a disordered to an ordered state at zero temperature. Ground state properties are obtained using the Path Integral Ground State (PIGS) method. We propose a Bond-Hamiltonian decomposition for the high temperature density matrix factorization of the imaginary time propagator. We show that \textit{cluster-loop} type moves are necessary to overcome ergodicity issues and to achieve efficient Markov Chain updates. Ground state energies and angular momentum properties are computed and compared with Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) benchmark results. In particular, the derivative of the kinetic energy with respect to the interaction strength estimator is presented as a successful order parameter for the detection of the quantum phase transition.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14977'&gt;arXiv:2506.14977&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 17 Jun 2025 21:05:13 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

Specifically, we compute the expectation values of local operators as functions of time and compare them to their thermal counterparts, quantify the overlap between the evolving density matrix and the thermal one, and compare the dynamics of the energy-momentum tensor to predictions from relativistic hydrodynamics. Through these studies, we find that the system approaches thermalization at late times and elucidate the mechanisms by which quantum entanglement drives thermalization in closed field-theoretic systems. Our results show how thermodynamic behavior emerges in real time from unitary quantum dynamics.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14983'&gt;arXiv:2506.14983&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 17 Jun 2025 21:12:51 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Unconventional Spin Dynamics and Supersolid Excitations in the Triangular-Lattice XXZ Model</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Rafael Flores-Calderón, Roderich Moessner, Frank Pollmann&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Motivated by recent experiments, we investigate the spin-1/2 XXZ model on the triangular lattice with strong Ising anisotropy, combining large-scale numerical simulations and analytical methods to uncover unconventional spin dynamics. First, we compute the dynamical spin structure factor using density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations and find excellent agreement with inelastic neutron scattering data on the layered compound $\text{K}_2\text{Co}(\text{SeO}_3)_2$. The low-energy spectrum reveals a roton-like minimum at the $M$ point, absent in linear spin-wave theory, accompanied by peak intensity and a broad continuum above it. Near the $\Gamma$ point, we observe an approximately linear dispersion with vanishing spectral weight. Second, we compare two analytical frameworks that reproduce the observed features. The first is a hard-core boson approach, which includes: (i) an effective staggered boson model (ESBM) at zero magnetic field, (ii) perturbation theory applied to the one-third magnetization plateau, and (iii) a self-consistent mean-field Schwinger boson theory (SBT). The second framework is based on a variational supersolid quantum dimer model (QDM) ansatz, combined with a single-mode approximation. The SBT captures the broad continuum, the $M$-point minimum, and linear dispersion at $\Gamma$, whereas the QDM reproduces the roton minimum and linear dispersion at finite momentum near $\Gamma$. Remarkably, both the QDM wavefunction and the DMRG ground state exhibit nearly identical structure factors with pronounced transverse photon-like excitations. Together, our comprehensive theoretical and numerical analysis elucidates the microscopic origin of supersolid excitations in the XXZ triangular lattice model and their proximity to a spin liquid phase observed experimentally.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15516'&gt;arXiv:2506.15516&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 18 Jun 2025 14:52:16 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Clifford augmented density matrix renormalization group for \textit{ab initio} quantum chemistry</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Lizhong Fu, Honghui Shang, Jinlong Yang, Chu Guo&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The recently proposed Clifford augmented density matrix renormalization group (CA-DMRG) method seamlessly integrates Clifford circuits with matrix product states, and takes advantage of the expression power from both. CA-DMRG has been shown to be able to achieve higher accuracy than standard DMRG on commonly used lattice models, with only moderate computational overhead compared to the latter. In this work, we propose an efficient scheme in CA-DMRG to deal with \textit{ab initio} quantum chemistry Hamiltonians, and apply it to study several molecular systems. Our numerical results show that CA-DMRG can reach several orders of magnitude higher accuracy than DMRG using the same bond dimension, pointing out a promising route to push the boundary of solving \textit{ab initio} quantum chemistry with strong static correlations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16026'&gt;arXiv:2506.16026&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 19 Jun 2025 04:48:52 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>A Scalable Factorization Approach for High-Order Structured Tensor Recovery</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16032</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Zhen Qin, Michael B. Wakin, Zhihui Zhu&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Tensor decompositions, which represent an $N$-order tensor using approximately $N$ factors of much smaller dimensions, can significantly reduce the number of parameters. This is particularly beneficial for high-order tensors, as the number of entries in a tensor grows exponentially with the order. Consequently, they are widely used in signal recovery and data analysis across domains such as signal processing, machine learning, and quantum physics. A computationally and memory-efficient approach to these problems is to optimize directly over the factors using local search algorithms such as gradient descent, a strategy known as the factorization approach in matrix and tensor optimization. However, the resulting optimization problems are highly nonconvex due to the multiplicative interactions between factors, posing significant challenges for convergence analysis and recovery guarantees. In this paper, we present a unified framework for the factorization approach to solving various tensor decomposition problems. Specifically, by leveraging the canonical form of tensor decompositions--where most factors are constrained to be orthonormal to mitigate scaling ambiguity--we apply Riemannian gradient descent (RGD) to optimize these orthonormal factors on the Stiefel manifold. Under a mild condition on the loss function, we establish a Riemannian regularity condition for the factorized objective and prove that RGD converges to the ground-truth tensor at a linear rate when properly initialized. Notably, both the initialization requirement and the convergence rate scale polynomially rather than exponentially with $N$, improving upon existing results for Tucker and tensor-train format tensors.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16032'&gt;arXiv:2506.16032&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 19 Jun 2025 05:07:07 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Superfluid dome in the spatially modulated two-dimensional XY model</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Feng-Feng Song, Aditya Chugh, Hanggai Nuomin, Naoki Kawashima, Alexander Wietek&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; In strongly correlated electron systems, superconductivity and charge density waves often coexist in close proximity, suggesting a deeper relationship between these competing phases. Recent research indicates that these orders can intertwine, with the superconducting order parameter coupling to modulations in the electronic density. To elucidate this interplay, we study a two-dimensional XY model with a periodic modulation of the coupling strength in one spatial direction. Using a combination of tensor network methods and Monte Carlo simulations, we reveal a non-monotonic, dome-like dependence of $T_c$ on the modulation wavelength, with the peak $T_c$ shifting to longer wavelengths as the modulation strength grows. The origin of this phenomenon is traced back to an effective pinning of vortices in the valleys of the modulation, confirmed by a comparison to modulated $q$-state clock models. These findings shed new light on the phase behavior of intertwined superconducting and charge-ordered states, offering a deeper understanding of their complex interactions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16068'&gt;arXiv:2506.16068&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 19 Jun 2025 06:50:44 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

Kratochvílová, M. Žonda, R. H. Colman&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The magnetic properties of the triangular magnet CeMgAl$_{11}$O$_{19}$ were investigated by magnetization and specific heat measurements down to $T=0.03\,$K on single crystals grown by the floating zone method. The formation of effective spins $S_\mathrm{eff}= 1/2$ below $T &lt; 10$\,K was confirmed both by DFT calculations and specific heat measurements. No magnetic order was found down to $T=0.03\,$K despite the formation of magnetic correlations observed in specific heat. The measured magnetization was compared with DMRG computation and their agreement supports the proposal of a strongly anisotropic magnetic interaction antiferromagnetically coupling the spin components in the $ab$ plane and ferromagnetically coupling the spin component along the $c$ axis. However, our quantitative study of the magnetization indicates a weaker proximity to quantum criticality between ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism than the previous inelastic neutron scattering study. Finally, we propose that the absence of magnetic order in CeMgAl$_{11}$O$_{19}$ would most probably be related to the structural disorder revealed by single-crystal X-ray diffraction.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16207'&gt;arXiv:2506.16207&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 19 Jun 2025 10:53:58 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Joint Tensor-Train Parameterization for Efficient and Expressive Low-Rank Adaptation</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16456</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Jun Qi, Chen-Yu Liu, Sabato Marco Siniscalchi, Chao-Han Huck Yang, Min-Hsiu Hsieh&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is widely recognized for its parameter-efficient fine-tuning of large-scale neural models. However, standard LoRA independently optimizes low-rank matrices, which inherently limits its expressivity and generalization capabilities. While classical tensor-train (TT) decomposition can be separately employed on individual LoRA matrices, this work demonstrates that the classical TT-based approach neither significantly improves parameter efficiency nor achieves substantial performance gains. This paper proposes TensorGuide, a novel tensor-train-guided adaptation framework to overcome these limitations. TensorGuide generates two correlated low-rank LoRA matrices through a unified TT structure driven by controlled Gaussian noise. The resulting joint TT representation inherently provides structured, low-rank adaptations, significantly enhancing expressivity, generalization, and parameter efficiency without increasing the number of trainable parameters. Theoretically, we justify these improvements through neural tangent kernel analyses, demonstrating superior optimization dynamics and enhanced generalization. Extensive experiments on quantum dot classification and GPT-2 fine-tuning benchmarks demonstrate that TensorGuide-based LoRA consistently outperforms standard LoRA and TT-LoRA, achieving improved accuracy and scalability with fewer parameters.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16456'&gt;arXiv:2506.16456&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 19 Jun 2025 16:46:23 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

Optimization can be performed for an arbitrary arrangement of input states, parameter encoding channels, noise correlations, control operations and measurements. The use of tensor networks and iterative see-saw algorithm allows for an efficient optimization even in the regime of large number of channel uses ($N\approx100$). Additionally, the package comes with an implementation of the recently developed methods for computing fundamental upper bounds on QFI, which serve as benchmarks of optimality of the outcomes of numerical optimization. All functionalities are wrapped up in a user-friendly interface which enables defining strategies at various levels of detail.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16524'&gt;arXiv:2506.16524&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 19 Jun 2025 18:13:22 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Theory of multi-qubit superradiance in a waveguide in the presence of finite delay times</title>

Using a numerically exact matrix product approach, we explore both Markovian and non-Markovian regimes, and highlight the significant influence of time-delayed feedback effects and the clear breakdown of assuming instantaneous coupling dynamics. We first show a system composed of two spatially separated qubits, prepared in a doubly excited state (both fully excited), and provide a comprehensive study of how delayed feedback influences the collective system decay rates, as well as the quantum correlations between waveguide photons, atoms, and between atom and photons. The system is then extended to include two additional qubits located next to the initial ones (four qubits in total), and we demonstrate, by manipulating the initial excitations and the time-delay effects, how long-term quantum correlations and light-matter entangled states can be established.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16605'&gt;arXiv:2506.16605&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 19 Jun 2025 21:09:15 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Rigorous Maximum Likelihood Estimation for Quantum States</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16646</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Kuchibhotla Aditi, Stephen Becker&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Existing quantum state tomography methods are limited in scalability due to their high computation and memory demands, making them impractical for recovery of large quantum states. In this work, we address these limitations by reformulating the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) problem using the Burer-Monteiro factorization, resulting in a non-convex but low-rank parameterization of the density matrix. We derive a fully unconstrained formulation by analytically eliminating the trace-one and positive semidefinite constraints, thereby avoiding the need for projection steps during optimization. Furthermore, we determine the Lagrange multiplier associated with the unit-trace constraint a priori, reducing computational overhead. The resulting formulation is amenable to scalable first-order optimization, and we demonstrate its tractability using limited-memory BFGS (L-BFGS). Importantly, we also propose a low-memory version of the above algorithm to fully recover certain large quantum states with Pauli-based POVM measurements. Our low-memory algorithm avoids explicitly forming any density matrix, and does not require the density matrix to have a matrix product state (MPS) or other tensor structure. For a fixed number of measurements and fixed rank, our algorithm requires just $\mathcal{O}(d \log d)$ complexity per iteration to recover a $d \times d$ density matrix. Additionally, we derive a useful error bound that can be used to give a rigorous termination criterion. We numerically demonstrate that our method is competitive with state-of-the-art algorithms for moderately sized problems, and then demonstrate that our method can solve a 20-qubit problem on a laptop in under 5 hours.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16646'&gt;arXiv:2506.16646&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 19 Jun 2025 23:18:50 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Qumode Tensor Networks for False Vacuum Decay in Quantum Field Theory</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17388</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Steven Abel, Michael Spannowsky, Simon Williams&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; False vacuum decay in scalar quantum field theory (QFT) plays a central role in cosmology and particle physics but has remained intractable for classical simulation due to its non-perturbative, highly entangled dynamics. We present a novel method for Hamiltonian simulation of false-vacuum decay in a self-interacting scalar QFT, based on a spatial discretisation into a lattice of bosonic modes. Each mode has a continuous or quasi-continuous local Hilbert space whose dimension is large enough to capture the self-interactions in the Hamiltonian. We refer to these local modes generically as ``qumodes'', echoing the ideal case in which the lattice would be realised on a continuous-variable quantum computer. Here we show that the same framework can be implemented on a tensor network, in which case the qumodes are quasi-continuous, corresponding to the local sites of the network having a very high dimensional Hilbert space. Using a time-evolving block decimation algorithm with Trotterised time evolution, we capture the real-time dynamics of the scalar field. In (1+1)-dimensions, we initialise a metastable vacuum and observe the coherent entanglement growth that seeds true-vacuum bubble nucleation. Our approach establishes the qumode network as a scalable framework for non-equilibrium scalar QFT phenomena and paves the way for higher-dimensional studies and continuous-variable quantum computing implementations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17388'&gt;arXiv:2506.17388&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 20 Jun 2025 18:00:02 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Rényi and Shannon mutual information in critical and decohered critical system</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Yoshihito Kuno, Takahiro Orito, Ikuo Ichinose&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We investigate a critical many-body system by introducing a R\'{e}nyi generalized mutual information, connecting between R\'{e}nyi mutual information and R\'{e}nyi Shannon mutual information. This R\'{e}nyi generalized mutual information can offer more experimentally accessible alternative than the conventional entanglement entropy. As a critical many-body state, we focus on the critical transverse-field Ising model (TFIM) described by the Ising conformal field theory (CFT). We show that even if we modify the non-selective projective measurement assumed in R\'{e}nyi Shannon mutual information by replacing the measurement into decoherence by environment, the R\'{e}nyi generalized Shannon mutual information maintains the CFT properties such as subsystem CFT scaling law and its central charge observed through both the conventional R\'{e}nyi Shannon mutual information and R\'{e}nyi mutual information. Furthermore, we apply a local decoherence to the critical ground state of the TFIM and numerically observe the R\'{e}nyi generalized mutual information by changing the parameter controlling environment effect (corresponding to the strength of measurement) in the R\'{e}nyi generalized mutual information and the strength of the decoherence to which the entire system subjects. We find that R\'{e}nyi-$2$ type central charge connected to the central charge is fairly robust, indicating the strong robustness of the Ising CFT properties against local decoherence by environment.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18475'&gt;arXiv:2506.18475&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 23 Jun 2025 10:18:53 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

At zero temperature and along the symmetry line of the phase diagram, we find a sequence of inhomogeneous ground states that arise through a real-space version of the mechanism of Hilbert-space fragmentation. For weak interactions, doping the symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phase of the GNW model leads to localized charges or holes at periodic arrangements of immobile topological defects separating the fragmented subchains: a topological crystal. Increasing the interactions, we observe a transition into a parity-broken phase with a pseudoscalar condensate displaying a modulated periodic pattern. This soliton lattice is a sequence of topological charges corresponding to anti-kinks, which also bind the doped fermions at their respective centers. Out of this symmetry line, we show that quasi-spiral profiles appear with a characteristic wavevector set by the density $k = 2{\pi}{\rho}$, providing non-perturbative evidence for chiral spirals beyond the large-N limit. These results demonstrate that various exotic inhomogeneous phases can arise in lattice field theories, and motivate the use of quantum simulators to confirm such QCD-inspired phenomena in future experiments.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18675'&gt;arXiv:2506.18675&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 23 Jun 2025 14:19:35 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Efficient optimization of variational tensor-network approach to three-dimensional statistical systems</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19339</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Xia-Ze Xu, Tong-Yu Lin, Guang-Ming Zhang&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Variational tensor network optimization has become a powerful tool for studying classical statistical models in two dimensions. However, its application to three-dimensional systems remains limited, primarily due to the high computational cost associated with evaluating the free energy density and its gradient. This process requires contracting a triple-layer tensor network composed of a projected entangled pair operator and projected entangled pair states. In this paper, we employ a split corner-transfer renormalization group scheme tailored for the contraction of such triple-layer networks, which reduces the computational complexity from $\mathcal{O}(D^{12})$ in conventional methods to $\mathcal{O}(D^{9})$. Through numerical benchmarks on the three-dimensional classical Ising model, we demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves numerical results comparable to the most recent Monte Carlo simulations, while also providing a substantial speedup over previous variational tensor network approaches. This makes this method well-suited for efficient gradient-based optimization in three-dimensional tensor network simulations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19339'&gt;arXiv:2506.19339&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 24 Jun 2025 06:05:59 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Csilla Király, Máté Lencsés&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We consider the Blume--Capel model in the scaling limit to realize the thermal perturbation of the tricritical Ising fixed point. We develop a numerical scaling limit extrapolation for one-point functions and R\'enyi entropies in the ground state. In a mass quench scenario, we found long-lived oscillations despite the absence of explicit spin-flip symmetry breaking or confining potential. We construct form factors of branch-point twist fields in the paramagnetic phase. In the scaling limit of small quenches, we verify form factor predictions for the energy density and leading magnetic field using the dynamics of one-point functions, and branch-point twist fields using the dynamics of R\'enyi entropies.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19596'&gt;arXiv:2506.19596&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 24 Jun 2025 13:05:54 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Weak unitary symmetries of open quantum dynamics: beyond quantum master equations</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Calum A. Brown, Robert L. Jack, Katarzyna Macieszczak&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We consider Markovian open quantum dynamics with weak unitary symmetries. Starting from the quantum master equation for the system alone, it is known that the joint dynamics of the system and its environment can be obtained by dilation, leading to a closed dynamics for a continuous matrix product state. Performing counting measurements on the environment gives rise to stochastic dynamics of quantum trajectories for the system, which when averaged yield back the quantum master equation. In this work, we identify necessary and sufficient conditions under which the dynamics of these different descriptions retain the weak symmetry of the quantum master equation and we characterise the resulting symmetries of the different descriptions in terms of their generators. We find that the joint dynamics always features a separable symmetry directly related to that of the quantum master equation, but for quantum trajectories the corresponding symmetry is present only if the counting measurement satisfies certain conditions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19814'&gt;arXiv:2506.19814&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 24 Jun 2025 17:27:43 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Yantao Wu, Zhehao Dai&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; In recent years, the variational Monte Carlo (VMC) calculations of projected entangled pair states (PEPS) has emerged as a competitive method for computing the ground states of many-body quantum systems. This method is particularly important for fermion systems where sign problems are abundant. We derive and explain the algorithms for the VMC calculations of fermion PEPS in the swap gates formulation. It is the purpose of this paper to be as concise and precise as possible. Diagramatic tensor notation is used whenever possible to serve this purpose. As a separate result, we prove the detailed balance of sequential sampling of tensor networks.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20106'&gt;arXiv:2506.20106&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 25 Jun 2025 03:40:57 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Quantum Utility-Scale Error Mitigation for Quantum Quench Dynamics in Heisenberg Spin Chains</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20125</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Seokwon Choi, Talal Ahmed Chowdhury, Kwangmin Yu&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We propose a quantum error mitigation method termed self-mitigation, which is comparable with zero-noise extrapolation, to achieve quantum utility on near-term, noisy quantum computers. We investigate the effectiveness of several quantum error mitigation strategies, including self-mitigation, by simulating quantum quench dynamics for Heisenberg spin chains with system sizes up to 104 qubits using IBM quantum processors. In particular, we discuss the limitations of zero-noise extrapolation and the advantages offered by self-mitigation at a large scale. The self-mitigation method shows stable accuracy with the large systems of 104 qubits with more than 3,000 CNOT gates. Also, we combine the discussed quantum error mitigation methods with practical entanglement entropy measuring methods, and it shows a good agreement with the theoretical estimation. Our study illustrates the usefulness of near-term noisy quantum hardware in examining the quantum quench dynamics of many-body systems at large scales, and lays the groundwork for surpassing classical simulations with quantum methods prior to the development of fault-tolerant quantum computers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20125'&gt;arXiv:2506.20125&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 25 Jun 2025 04:33:39 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>A Survey on Continuous Variable Quantum Key Distribution for Secure Data Transmission: Toward the Future of Secured Quantum-Networks</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21640</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Mobin Motaharifar, Mahmood Hasani, Hassan Kaatuzian&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Quantum key distribution (QKD) represents a cornerstone of secure communication in the quantum era. While discrete-variable QKD (DV-QKD) protocols were historically the first to demonstrate secure key exchange, continuous-variable QKD (CV-QKD) has emerged as a more practical alternative due to its seamless compatibility with current telecommunications infrastructure. CV-QKD relies on coherent and squeezed states of light, offering significant advantages for integration into modern optical networks. This review comprehensively explores the theoretical underpinnings, technological advancements, and practical challenges of CV-QKD. Special attention is given to the role of photonic integrated circuits (PICs) in enabling scalable and efficient implementation of CV-QKD systems. Furthermore, recent advances in machine learning have been leveraged to optimize CV-QKD performance, with data-driven techniques enhancing noise estimation, parameter optimization, and system security. Additionally, tensor networks provide efficient computational tools for analyzing complex quantum correlations, improving the efficiency and robustness of quantum key distribution protocols. These developments, combined with ongoing improvements in quantum photonic integration, pave the way for the practical deployment of large-scale, high-speed quantum-secure networks.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21640'&gt;arXiv:2506.21640&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 25 Jun 2025 19:58:44 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Dipoles and Anyonic Directional Confinement via Twisted Toric Codes</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Jose Garre Rubio&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We introduce a modified 2D toric code Hamiltonian that exhibits explicit anyon confinement along a single spatial direction. By bounding the motion of these confined anyons, we obtain dipolar excitations with restricted mobility. We analyze the resulting logical operators, whose existence depends on the system size, as well as the structure of gapped boundaries and a tensor network representation of the ground state. Furthermore, when confinement is enforced in both directions, fractal-like excitations emerge, resulting in unpaired logical operators. We extend our construction to 3D models, such as the surface code and the X-cube model, leading to novel dipole-loop and dipole-planon excitations that arise from bounding confined excitations. These modifications are implemented through group cohomological twistings--projective representations of finite groups--with most examples based on Z2xZ2.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22025'&gt;arXiv:2506.22025&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 27 Jun 2025 08:46:23 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Low-Rank Implicit Neural Representation via Schatten-p Quasi-Norm and Jacobian Regularization</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22134</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Zhengyun Cheng, Changhao Wang, Guanwen Zhang, Yi Xu, Wei Zhou, Xiangyang Ji&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Higher-order tensors are well-suited for representing multi-dimensional data, such as color images and videos. Low-rank tensor representation has become essential in machine learning and computer vision, but existing methods like Tucker decomposition offer flexibility at the expense of interpretability. In contrast, while the CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) decomposition provides a more natural and interpretable tensor structure, obtaining sparse solutions remains challenging. Leveraging the rich properties of CP decomposition, we propose a CP-based low-rank tensor function parameterized by neural networks for implicit neural representation (CP-INR). This approach enables continuous data representation beyond structured grids, fully exploiting the non-linearity of tensor data with theoretical guarantees on excess risk bounds. To achieve a sparse CP decomposition, we introduce a variational form of the Schatten-p quasi-norm and prove its relationship to multilinear rank minimization. For smoothness, we propose a regularization term based on the spectral norm of the Jacobian and Hutchinson's trace estimator. Our proposed smoothness regularization is SVD-free and avoids explicit chain rule derivations. It can serve as an alternative to Total Variation (TV) regularization in image denoising tasks and is naturally applicable to continuous data. Extensive experiments on multi-dimensional data recovery tasks, including image inpainting, denoising, and point cloud upsampling, demonstrate the superiority and versatility of our method compared to state-of-the-art approaches.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22134'&gt;arXiv:2506.22134&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 27 Jun 2025 11:23:10 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Causal Decompositions of 1D Quantum Cellular Automata</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22219</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Augustin Vanrietvelde, Octave Mestoudjian, Pablo Arrighi&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Understanding quantum theory's causal structure stands out as a major matter, since it radically departs from classical notions of causality. We present advances in the research program of causal decompositions, which investigates the existence of an equivalence between the causal and the compositional structures of unitary channels. Our results concern one-dimensional Quantum Cellular Automata (1D QCAs), i.e. unitary channels over a line of $N$ quantum systems (with or without periodic boundary conditions) that feature a causality radius $r$: a given input cannot causally influence outputs at a distance more than $r$. We prove that, for $N \geq 4r + 1$, 1D QCAs all admit causal decompositions: a unitary channel is a 1D QCA if and only if it can be decomposed into a unitary routed circuit of nearest-neighbour interactions, in which its causal structure is compositionally obvious. This provides the first constructive form of 1D QCAs with causality radius one or more, fully elucidating their structure. In addition, we show that this decomposition can be taken to be translation-invariant for the case of translation-invariant QCAs. Our proof of these results makes use of innovative algebraic techniques, leveraging a new framework for capturing partitions into non-factor sub-C* algebras.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22219'&gt;arXiv:2506.22219&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 27 Jun 2025 13:36:50 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Spin Seebeck Effect of Triangular-lattice Spin Supersolid</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22414</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Yuan Gao, Yixuan Huang, Sadamichi Maekawa, Wei Li&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Using the developed thermal tensor-network approach, we investigate the spin Seebeck effect (SSE) of the triangular-lattice quantum antiferromagnet hosting spin supersolid phase. We focus on the low-temperature scaling behaviors of the normalized spin current across the interface. Using the 1D Heisenberg chain as a benchmark system, we observe a negative spinon spin current exhibiting algebraic scaling $T^{\alpha}$, with exponent $\alpha$, in the Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid phase. On the triangular lattice, spin frustration dramatically enhances the low-temperature SSE, with distinct spin-current signatures - particularly the sign reversal and characteristic temperature dependence - distinguishing different spin states. Remarkably, we discover a persistent, negative spin current in the spin supersolid phase. It saturates to a non-zero value in the low-temperature limit, and can be ascribed to the Goldstone-mode-mediated spin supercurrents. Moreover, a universal scaling $T^{d/z}$ is found at the U(1)-symmetric polarization quantum critical points. These distinct quantum spin transport traits provide sensitive probes for spin-supersolid compounds such as Na$_2$BaCo(PO$_4$)$_2$. Furthermore, our results establish spin supersolids as a tunable quantum platform for spin caloritronics in the ultralow-temperature regime.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22414'&gt;arXiv:2506.22414&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 27 Jun 2025 17:41:39 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Conformal scalar field theory from Ising tricriticality on the fuzzy sphere</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Joseph Taylor, Cristian Voinea, Zlatko Papić, Ruihua Fan&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Free theories are landmarks in the landscape of quantum field theories: their exact solvability serves as a pillar for perturbative constructions of interacting theories. Fuzzy sphere regularization, which combines quantum Hall physics with state-operator correspondence, has recently been proposed as a promising framework for simulating three-dimensional conformal field theories (CFTs), but so far it has not provided access to free theories. We overcome this limitation by designing a bilayer quantum Hall system that hosts an Ising tricritical point -- a nontrivial fixed point where first-order and second-order transitions meet -- which flows to the conformally coupled scalar theory in the infrared. The critical energy spectrum and operator structure match those at the Gaussian fixed point, providing nonperturbative evidence for the emergence of a free scalar CFT. Our results expand the landscape of CFTs realizable on the fuzzy sphere and demonstrate that even free bosonic theories -- previously inaccessible -- can emerge from interacting electrons in this framework.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22539'&gt;arXiv:2506.22539&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 27 Jun 2025 18:00:00 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

Tensor network states are one of the workhorses to compute ground states of many-body systems, yet the accurate computation of excited eigenstates is still challenging. Here, we develop a combination of the inexact Lanczos method, which aims at efficiently computing excited states, to tree tensor network states (TTNSs). We demonstrate our approach by computing excited vibrational states for three challenging problems: (1) 84 states in different energy intervals of acetonitrile (12-dimensional), (2) Fermi resonance states of the fluxional Zundel ion (15-dimensional), and (3) selected excited states of the fluxional and very correlated Eigen ion (33-dimensional). The proposed TTNS inexact Lanczos method is directly applicable to other quantum many-body systems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22574'&gt;arXiv:2506.22574&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 27 Jun 2025 18:43:19 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Extended Non-Markovian Stochastic Schrödinger Equation with Complex Frequency Modes for General Basis Functions</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22738</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Yukai Guo, Zeyu Huang, Xing Gao&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We introduce an extended formulation of the non-Markovian stochastic Schr\"odinger equation with complex frequency modes (extended cNMSSE), designed for simulating open quantum system dynamics under arbitrary spectral densities. This extension employs non-exponential basis sets to expand the bath correlation functions, overcoming the reliance of the original cNMSSE on exponential decompositions of the spectral density. Consequently, the extended cNMSSE is applicable to environments beyond those characterized by Debye-type spectral densities. The flexibility to employ general basis functions is particularly advantageous for handling spectral densities with higher-order poles, for which exponential decompositions are often inaccurate or unavailable. The extended cNMSSE is implemented in a pseudo-Fock space using conventional ladder operators and solved efficiently via matrix product state (MPS) techniques, preserving the favorable linear-scaling and wavefunction-based nature of the original method. Benchmark simulations across four representative cases, including discrete spectral density, Ohmic spectral density with exponential and algebraic cutoffs, and critically damped Brownian spectral density, demonstrate excellent agreement with results of hierarchy of forward-backward stochastic Schr\"odinger equations (HFB-SSE) and extended hierarchical equation of motion (HEOM).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22738'&gt;arXiv:2506.22738&lt;/a&gt;] Published Sat, 28 Jun 2025 02:47:14 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Ryui Kaneko, Shimpei Goto&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We find an efficient approach to approximately convert matrix product states (MPSs) into restricted Boltzmann machine wave functions consisting of a multinomial hidden unit through a canonical polyadic (CP) decomposition of the MPSs. This method allows us to generate well-behaved initial neural network quantum states for quantum many-body ground-state calculations in polynomial time of the number of variational parameters and systematically shorten the distance between the initial states and the ground states with increasing the rank of the CP decomposition. We demonstrate the efficiency of our method by taking the transverse-field Ising model as an example and discuss possible applications of our method to more general quantum many-body systems in which the ground-state wave functions possess complex nodal structures.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23550'&gt;arXiv:2506.23550&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 30 Jun 2025 06:49:31 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Shakir Showkat Sofi, Charlotte Vermeylen, Lieven De Lathauwer&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Quantum state tomography (QST) is a fundamental technique for estimating the state of a quantum system from measured data and plays a crucial role in evaluating the performance of quantum devices. However, standard estimation methods become impractical due to the exponential growth of parameters in the state representation. In this work, we address this challenge by parameterizing the state using a low-rank block tensor train decomposition and demonstrate that our approach is both memory- and computationally efficient. This framework applies to a broad class of quantum states that can be well approximated by low-rank decompositions, including pure states, nearly pure states, and ground states of Hamiltonians.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23560'&gt;arXiv:2506.23560&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 30 Jun 2025 07:06:50 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>High-Performance Contraction of Quantum Circuits for Riemannian Optimization</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23775</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Fabian Putterer, Max M. Zumpe, Isabel Nha Minh Le, Qunsheng Huang, Christian B. Mendl&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; This work focuses on optimizing the gates of a quantum circuit with a given topology to approximate the unitary time evolution governed by a Hamiltonian. Recognizing that unitary matrices form a mathematical manifold, we employ Riemannian optimization methods -- specifically the Riemannian trust-region algorithm -- which involves second derivative calculations with respect to the gates. Our key technical contribution is a matrix-free algorithmic framework that avoids the explicit construction and storage of large unitary matrices acting on the whole Hilbert space. Instead, we evaluate all quantities as sums over state vectors, assuming that these vectors can be stored in memory. We develop HPC-optimized kernels for applying gates to state vectors and for the gradient and Hessian computation. Further improvements are achieved by exploiting sparsity structures due to Hamiltonian conservation laws, such as parity conservation, and lattice translation invariance. We benchmark our implementation on the Fermi-Hubbard model with up to 16 sites, demonstrating a nearly linear parallelization speed-up with up to 112 CPU threads. Finally, we compare our implementation with an alternative matrix product operator-based approach.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23775'&gt;arXiv:2506.23775&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 30 Jun 2025 12:18:16 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Canonical partial ordering from min-cuts and quantum entanglement in random tensor networks</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23894</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Miao Hu, Ion Nechita&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The \emph{max-flow min-cut theorem} has been recently used in the theory of random tensor networks in quantum information theory, where it is helpful for computing the behavior of important physical quantities, such as the entanglement entropy. In this paper, we extend the max-flow min-cut theorem to a relation among different \emph{partial orders} on the set of vertices of a network and introduce a new partial order for the vertices based on the \emph{min-cut structure} of the network. We apply the extended max-flow min-cut theorem to random tensor networks and find that the \emph{finite correction} to the entanglement R\'enyi entropy arising from the degeneracy of the min-cuts is given by the number of \emph{order morphisms} from the min-cut partial order to the partial order induced by non-crossing partitions on the symmetric group. Moreover, we show that the number of order morphisms corresponds to moments of a graph-dependent measure which generalizes the free Bessel law in some special cases in free probability theory.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23894'&gt;arXiv:2506.23894&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 30 Jun 2025 14:26:40 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Ruelle-Pollicott resonances of diffusive U(1)-invariant qubit circuits</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Urban Duh, Marko Žnidarič&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We study Ruelle-Pollicott resonances of translationally invariant magnetization-conserving qubit circuits via the spectrum of the quasi-momentum-resolved truncated propagator of extensive observables. Diffusive transport of the conserved magnetization is reflected in the Gaussian quasi-momentum $k$ dependence of the leading eigenvalue (Ruelle-Pollicott resonance) of the truncated propagator for small $k$. This, in particular, allows us to extract the diffusion constant. For large $k$, the leading Ruelle-Pollicott resonance is not related to transport and governs the exponential decay of correlation functions. Additionally, we conjecture the existence of a continuum of eigenvalues below the leading diffusive resonance, which governs non-exponential decay, for instance, power-law hydrodynamic tails. We expect our conclusions to hold for generic systems with exactly one U(1) conserved quantity.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24097'&gt;arXiv:2506.24097&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 30 Jun 2025 17:49:16 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Multi-Target Density Matrix Renormalization Group X algorithm and its application to circuit quantum electrodynamics</title>

However, exact diagonalization of the device Hamiltonian is challenging for system sizes beyond tens of qubits. Here, we employ a variant of the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) algorithm, DMRG-X, to efficiently obtain localized eigenstates of a 2D transmon array without the need to first compute lower-energy states. We also introduce MTDMRG-X, a new algorithm that combines DMRG-X with multi-target DMRG to efficiently compute excited states even in regimes with strong eigenstate hybridization. We showcase the use of these methods for the analysis of long-range couplings in a multi-transmon Hamiltonian including qubits and couplers, and we discuss eigenstate localization. These developments facilitate the design and parameter optimization of large-scale superconducting quantum processors.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24109'&gt;arXiv:2506.24109&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 30 Jun 2025 17:55:20 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Complete Boundary Phase Diagram of the Spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ XXZ Chain with Boundary Fields in the Anti-Ferromagnetic Gapped Regime</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00386</link>

Pixley, Patrick Azaria, Natan Andrei&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We consider the spin $\frac{1}{2}$ XXZ chain with diagonal boundary fields and solve it exactly using Bethe ansatz in the gapped anti-ferromagnetic regime and obtain the complete phase boundary diagram. Depending on the values of the boundary fields, the system exhibits several phases which can be categorized based on the ground state exhibited by the system and also based on the number of bound states localized at the boundaries. We show that the Hilbert space is comprised of a certain number of towers whose number depends on the number of boundary bound states exhibited by the system. The system undergoes boundary phase transitions when boundary fields are varied across certain critical values. There exist two types of phase transitions. In the first type the ground state of the system undergoes a change. In the second type, named the `Eigenstate phase transition', the number of towers of the Hilbert space changes, which is again associated with the change in the number of boundary bound states exhibited by the system. We use the DMRG and exact diagonalization techniques to probe the signature of the Eigenstate phase transition and the ground state phase transition by analyzing the spin profiles in each eigenstate.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00386'&gt;arXiv:2507.00386&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 01 Jul 2025 02:45:56 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Charge pumps, pivot Hamiltonians and symmetry-protected topological phases</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00995</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Nick. G. Jones, Ryan Thorngren, Ruben Verresen, Abhishodh Prakash&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Generalised charge pumps are topological obstructions to trivialising loops in the space of symmetric gapped Hamiltonians. We show that given mild conditions on such pumps, the associated loop has high-symmetry points which must be in distinct symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases. To further elucidate the connection between pumps and SPTs, we focus on closed paths, `pivot loops', defined by two Hamiltonians, where the first is unitarily evolved by the second `pivot' Hamiltonian. While such pivot loops have been studied as entanglers for SPTs, here we explore their connection to pumps. We construct families of pivot loops which pump charge for various symmetry groups, often leading to SPT phases -- including dipole SPTs. Intriguingly, we find examples where non-trivial pumps do not lead to genuine SPTs but still entangle representation-SPTs (RSPTs). We use the anomaly associated to the non-trivial pump to explain the a priori `unnecessary' criticality between these RSPTs. We also find that particularly nice pivot families form circles in Hamiltonian space, which we show is equivalent to the Hamiltonians satisfying the Dolan-Grady relation -- known from the study of integrable models. This additional structure allows us to derive more powerful constraints on the phase diagram. Natural examples of such circular loops arise from pivoting with the Onsager-integrable chiral clock models, containing the aforementioned RSPT example. In fact, we show that these Onsager pivots underlie general group cohomology-based pumps in one spatial dimension. Finally, we recast the above in the language of equivariant families of Hamiltonians and relate the invariants of the pump to the candidate SPTs. We also highlight how certain SPTs arise in cases where the equivariant family is labelled by spaces that are not manifolds.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00995'&gt;arXiv:2507.00995&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 01 Jul 2025 17:46:09 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Tensor network methods for the Gross-Pitaevskii equation on fine grids</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Ryan J. J. Connor, Callum W. Duncan, Andrew J. Daley&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The Gross-Pitaevskii equation and its generalisations to dissipative and dipolar gases have been very useful in describing dynamics of cold atomic gases, as well as polaritons and other nonlinear systems. For some of these applications the numerically accessible grid spacing can become a limiting factor, especially in describing turbulent dynamics and short-range effects of dipole-dipole interactions. We explore the application of tensor networks to these systems, where (in analogy to related work in fluid and plasma dynamics), they allow for physically motivated data compression that makes simulations possible on large spatial grids which would be unfeasible with direct numerical simulations. Analysing different non-equilibrium cases involving vortex formation, we find that these methods are particularly efficient, especially in combination with a matrix product operator representation of the quantum Fourier transform, which enables a spectral approach to calculation of both equilibrium states and time-dependent dynamics. The efficiency of these methods has interesting physical implications for the structure in the states that are generated by these dynamics, and provides a path to describe cold gas experiments that are challenging for existing methods.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01149'&gt;arXiv:2507.01149&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 01 Jul 2025 19:16:19 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

We explore quantum machine learning to model complex skin conductance response (SCR) events that reflect pedestrian stress in a virtual reality road crossing experiment. For this purpose, Quantum Support Vector Machine (QSVM) with an eight-qubit ZZ feature map and a Quantum Neural Network (QNN) using a Tree Tensor Network ansatz and an eight-qubit ZZ feature map, were developed on Pennylane. The dataset consists of SCR measurements along with features such as the response amplitude and elapsed time, which have been categorized into amplitude-based classes. The QSVM achieved good training accuracy, but had an overfitting problem, showing a low test accuracy of 45% and therefore impacting the reliability of the classification model. The QNN model reached a higher test accuracy of 55%, making it a better classification model than the QSVM and the classic versions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01235'&gt;arXiv:2507.01235&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 01 Jul 2025 23:18:50 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>String Breaking Dynamics and Glueball Formation in a $2+1$D Lattice Gauge Theory</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Kaidi Xu, Umberto Borla, Sergej Moroz, Jad C. Halimeh&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; With the advent of advanced quantum processors capable of probing lattice gauge theories (LGTs) in higher spatial dimensions, it is crucial to understand string dynamics in such models to guide upcoming experiments and to make connections to high-energy physics (HEP). Using tensor network methods, we study the far-from-equilibrium quench dynamics of electric flux strings between two static charges in the $2+1$D $\mathbb{Z}_2$ LGT with dynamical matter. We calculate the probabilities of finding the time-evolved wave function in string configurations of the same length as the initial string. At resonances determined by the the electric field strength and the mass, we identify various string breaking processes accompanied with matter creation. Away from resonance strings exhibit intriguing confined dynamics which, for strong electric fields, we fully characterize through effective perturbative models. Starting in maximal-length strings, we find that the wave function enters a dynamical regime where it splits into shorter strings and disconnected loops, with the latter bearing qualitative resemblance to glueballs in quantum chromodynamics (QCD). Our findings can be probed on state-of-the-art superconducting-qubit and trapped-ion quantum processors.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01950'&gt;arXiv:2507.01950&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 02 Jul 2025 17:57:52 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

Laumann&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We demonstrate that the chiral $\mathbb{Z}_p$ toric code -- the quintessential model of topological order -- hosts additional, emergent topological phases when perturbed: descendant fractional quantum Hall-like states, which we term \textit{Hall-on-Toric}. These hierarchical states feature fractionalized $\mathbb{Z}_p$ charges and increased topological ground-state degeneracy. The Hall-on-Toric phases appear in the vicinity of the transitions between deconfined $\mathbb{Z}_p$ phases with different background charge per unit cell, in a fixed non-trivial flux background. We confirm their existence through extensive infinite density matrix renormalization group (iDMRG) simulations, analyzing the topological entanglement entropy, entanglement spectra, and a generalized Hall conductance. Remarkably, the Hall-on-Toric states remain robust even in the absence of $U(1)$ symmetry. Our findings reinforce the foundational interpretation of star and plaquette defects as magnetic and electric excitations, and reveal that this perspective extends to a much deeper level.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02035'&gt;arXiv:2507.02035&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 02 Jul 2025 18:00:00 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>The covariance matrix spectrum of correlated charge insulators reveals hidden connections to Coupled Cluster, Matrix Product, and Rokhsar-Kivelson states</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02625</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Izak Snyman, Serge Florens&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Charge ordering induced by strong short-range repulsion in itinerant fermion systems typically follows a two-sites alternation pattern. However, the covariance matrix spectrum of the one-dimensional, half-filled, spinless $t$-$V$ model reveals a post-Hartree-Fock picture at strong repulsion, with emergent four-site disruptions of the underlying staggered mean-field state. These disruptions are captured in a thermodynamically extensive manner by a compact four-fermion Coupled Cluster (doubles) state (CCS). Remarkably, all properties of this state may be computed analytically by combinatorial means, and also derived from an exactly solvable correlated hopping Hamiltonian. Furthermore, this Coupled Cluster state can be re-expressed as a low-rank Matrix Product State (MPS) with bond dimension exactly four. In addition, we unveil a hidden connection between this Coupled Cluster ansatz and a Rokhsar-Kivelson state (RKS), which is the ground state of a solvable parent quantum tetramer model. The broad picture that we uncover here thus provides deep connections between several core concepts of correlated fermions and quantum chemistry that have previously enjoyed limited synergy. In contrast to a recent perturbative treatment on top of Hartree-Fock theory, our approach asymptotically captures the correct correlations in the $t$-$V$ model at small $t/V$, and remains a qualitatively accurate approximation even outside the perturbative regime. Our results make the case for further studies of the covariance matrix for correlated electron systems in which ground states have non-trivial unit-cell structure.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02625'&gt;arXiv:2507.02625&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 03 Jul 2025 13:50:40 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Imprints of information scrambling on eigenstates of a quantum chaotic system</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02853</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Bikram Pain, Ratul Thakur, Sthitadhi Roy&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; How are the spatial and temporal patterns of information scrambling in locally interacting quantum many-body systems imprinted on the eigenstates of the system's time-evolution operator? We address this question by identifying statistical correlations among sets of minimally four eigenstates that provide a unified framework for various measures of information scrambling. These include operator mutual information and operator entanglement entropy of the time-evolution operator, as well as more conventional diagnostics such as two-point dynamical correlations and out-of-time-ordered correlators. We demonstrate this framework by deriving exact results for eigenstate correlations in a minimal model of quantum chaos -- Floquet dual-unitary circuits. These results reveal not only the butterfly effect and the information lightcone, but also finer structures of scrambling within the lightcone. Our work thus shows how the eigenstates of a chaotic system can encode the full spatiotemporal anatomy of quantum chaos, going beyond the descriptions offered by random matrix theory and the eigenstate thermalisation hypothesis.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02853'&gt;arXiv:2507.02853&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 03 Jul 2025 17:57:23 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Dynamical correlation functions for the one-dimensional Bose-Hubbard insulator</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Kevin zu Münster, Florian Gebhard, Satoshi Ejima, Holger Fehske&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We calculate the dynamical current and kinetic-energy correlation functions for the first Mott lobe of the one-dimensional Bose-Hubbard model. We employ the strong-coupling expansion up to sixth order in $x=t/U$, and the dynamical density-matrix renormalization group method on rings with 64 sites. The correlation functions are finite above the single-particle gap with a square-root onset, as is also found from field theory close to the Mott transition. The correlation functions display a featureless superposition of the primary and tertiary Hubbard bands. We find very good agreement between all methods in the interaction/frequency regimes where they are applicable.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03125'&gt;arXiv:2507.03125&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 03 Jul 2025 19:04:36 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Quantics Tensor Train for solving Gross-Pitaevskii equation</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03134</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Aleix Bou-Comas, Marcin Płodzień, Luca Tagliacozzo, Juan José García-Ripoll&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We present a quantum-inspired solver for the one-dimensional Gross-Pitaevskii equation in the Quantics Tensor-Train (QTT) representation. By evolving the system entirely within a low-rank tensor manifold, the method sidesteps the memory and runtime barriers that limit conventional finite-difference and spectral schemes. Two complementary algorithms are developed: an imaginary-time projector that drives the condensate toward its variational ground state and a rank-adapted fourth-order Runge-Kutta integrator for real-time dynamics. The framework captures a broad range of physical scenarios - including barrier-confined condensates, quasi-random potentials, long-range dipolar interactions, and multicomponent spinor dynamics - without leaving the compressed representation. Relative to standard discretizations, the QTT approach achieves an exponential reduction in computational resources while retaining quantitative accuracy, thereby extending the practicable regime of Gross-Pitaevskii simulations on classical hardware. These results position tensor networks as a practical bridge between high-performance classical computing and prospective quantum hardware for the numerical treatment of nonlinear Schrodinger-type partial differential equations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03134'&gt;arXiv:2507.03134&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 03 Jul 2025 19:23:52 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

For a periodic (Floquet) non-unitary evolution, such circuits are exactly tractable and admit volume-to-area law transitions. We show that breaking time-translation symmetry down to a quasiperiodic (Fibonacci) time evolution leads to the emergence of a critical phase with tunable effective central charge and with a fractal origin. Furthermore, for some classes of random non-unitary circuits, we demonstrate the robustness of the volume-to-area law phase transition for arbitrary random realizations, thanks to the emergent compactness of the classical map encoding the circuit's dynamics.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03768'&gt;arXiv:2507.03768&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 04 Jul 2025 18:34:17 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Independent Set Enumeration and Estimation of Related Constants of Grid Graphs and Their Variants</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04007</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Kai Liang&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We applied tensor network contraction algorithms to compute the hard-core lattice gas model, i.e., the enumeration of independent sets on grid graphs. We observed the influence of surface effect and parity effect on the enumeration (and entropy), and derived upper and lower bounds for both the combinatorics entropy and the coefficients of surface effect by numerical analysis. Additionally, we conducted corresponding calculations and analyses for triangular grid graphs, king graph, and cylindrical grid graph. We computed and analyzed their associated constants and compared how different adjacency and boundary conditions affect these constants. Our computational results have contributed substantial new terms to the OEIS sequence A089980, A027740, A219741, A226444, A245013 and A286513. In addition, we have provided fairly accurate estimates of the relevant constants through numerical analysis of the obtained results. Among them, our valuation of the hard square entropy constant is more accurate than existing results. And we conject that the surface effect of the periodic boundary of the cylindrical grid graph is $0$--its estimated value of coefficients is very close to $0$.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04007'&gt;arXiv:2507.04007&lt;/a&gt;] Published Sat, 05 Jul 2025 11:22:37 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Solving the Gross-Pitaevskii equation on multiple different scales using the quantics tensor train representation</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04262</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Marcel Niedermeier, Adrien Moulinas, Thibaud Louvet, Jose L. Lado, Xavier Waintal&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Solving partial differential equations of highly featured problems represents a formidable challenge, where reaching high precision across multiple length scales can require a prohibitive amount of computer memory or computing time. However, the solutions to physics problems typically have structures operating on different length scales, and as a result exhibit a high degree of compressibility. Here, we use the quantics tensor train representation to build a solver for the time-dependent Gross-Pitaevskii equation. We demonstrate that the quantics approach generalizes well to the presence of the non-linear term in the equation. We show that we can resolve phenomena across length scales separated by seven orders of magnitude in one dimension within one hour on a single core in a laptop, greatly surpassing the capabilities of more naive methods. We illustrate our methodology with various modulated optical trap potentials presenting features at vastly different length scales, including solutions to the Gross-Pitaevskii equation on two-dimensional grids above a trillion points ($2^{20} \times 2^{20}$). This quantum-inspired methodology can be readily extended to other partial differential equations combining spatial and temporal evolutions, providing a powerful method to solve highly featured differential equations at unprecedented length scales.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04262'&gt;arXiv:2507.04262&lt;/a&gt;] Published Sun, 06 Jul 2025 06:45:12 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

By adapting time-dependent variational principle (TDVP) and gradient descent methods, we accurately handle the GPE's nonlinearities within the QTT structure. Our approach enables high-resolution simulations with drastically reduced computational cost. We benchmark ground states and dynamics of BECs--including vortex lattice formation and breathing modes--demonstrating superior performance over conventional grid-based methods and stable long-time evolution due to saturating bond dimensions. This establishes QTT as a powerful tool for nonlinear quantum simulations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04279'&gt;arXiv:2507.04279&lt;/a&gt;] Published Sun, 06 Jul 2025 07:39:05 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Unifying Robot Optimization: Monte Carlo Tree Search with Tensor Factorization</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04949</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Teng Xue, Amirreza Razmjoo, Yan Zhang, Sylvain Calinon&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Many robotic tasks, such as inverse kinematics, motion planning, and optimal control, can be formulated as optimization problems. Solving these problems involves addressing nonlinear kinematics, complex contact dynamics, and long-horizon planning, each posing distinct challenges for state-of-the-art optimization methods. To efficiently solve a wide range of tasks across varying scenarios, researchers either develop specialized algorithms for the task to achieve, or switch between different frameworks. Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) is a general-purpose decision-making tool that enables strategic exploration across problem instances without relying on task-specific structures. However, MCTS suffers from combinatorial complexity, leading to slow convergence and high memory usage. To address this limitation, we propose \emph{Tensor Train Tree Search} (TTTS), which leverages tensor factorization to exploit the separable structure of decision trees. This yields a low-rank, linear-complexity representation that significantly reduces both computation time and storage requirements. We prove that TTTS can efficiently reach the bounded global optimum within a finite time. Experimental results across inverse kinematics, motion planning around obstacles, multi-stage motion planning, and bimanual whole-body manipulation demonstrate the efficiency of TTTS on a diverse set of robotic tasks.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04949'&gt;arXiv:2507.04949&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 07 Jul 2025 12:49:20 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Moiré-assisted charge instability in ultrathin RuO$_2$</title>

In the face of daunting evidence for bulk magnetic order despite promising theoretical predictions, it naturally suggests the focus on thin films where Coulomb interactions are dimensionally quenched and may yield a more strongly correlated environment prone to magnetic ordering. Here, we combine scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), density functional theory (DFT), and density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) methods to investigate atomically ordered ultrathin RuO$_2$(110) grown on Ru(0001). Contrary to predictions of magnetic order, we observe a nonmagnetic charge density wave (CDW) instability that is driven by Fermi surface nesting within the flat-band surface state, and stabilized by the incommensurate moir\'e stacking with the substrate. We further identify a nonmagnetic and metastable 2 $\times$ 2 surface reconstruction that breaks in-plane mirror symmetry and can be reversibly toggled via STM tip manipulation. Our spin-polarized STM measurements find no sign of any magnetic instability at the RuO$_2$ surface. As much as our findings refute proposals for either bulk or surface magnetism in RuO$_2$, we establish ultrathin RuO$_2$(110) as an intriguing platform for exploring Moir\'e-assisted electronic surface order.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05047'&gt;arXiv:2507.05047&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 07 Jul 2025 14:30:04 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Disentangling strategies and entanglement transitions in unitary circuit games with matchgates</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05055</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Raúl Morral-Yepes, Marc Langer, Adam Gammon-Smith, Barbara Kraus, Frank Pollmann&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; In unitary circuit games, two competing parties, an "entangler" and a "disentangler", can induce an entanglement phase transition in a quantum many-body system. The transition occurs at a certain rate at which the disentangler acts. We analyze such games within the context of matchgate dynamics, which equivalently corresponds to evolutions of non-interacting fermions. We first investigate general entanglement properties of fermionic Gaussian states (FGS). We introduce a representation of FGS using a minimal matchgate circuit capable of preparing the state and derive an algorithm based on a generalized Yang-Baxter relation for updating this representation as unitary operations are applied. This representation enables us to define a natural disentangling procedure that reduces the number of gates in the circuit, thereby decreasing the entanglement contained in the system. We then explore different strategies to disentangle the systems and study the unitary circuit game in two different scenarios: with braiding gates, i.e., the intersection of Clifford gates and matchgates, and with generic matchgates. For each model, we observe qualitatively different entanglement transitions, which we characterize both numerically and analytically.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05055'&gt;arXiv:2507.05055&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 07 Jul 2025 14:38:50 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Instability of the Haldane Phase: Roles of Charge Fluctuations and Hund's Coupling</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Satoshi Nishimoto&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We systematically investigate the stability of the symmetry-protected topological (SPT) Haldane phase in spin-1/2 Heisenberg and half-filled Hubbard ladders coupled by ferromagnetic Hund's interactions. Using density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) method, we analyze key signatures of the Haldane phase: long-range string order, finite spin gap, and characteristic entanglement spectrum degeneracies. In spin-only Heisenberg ladders, we find immediate onset and continuous strengthening of the Haldane phase with increasing Hund's coupling. In contrast, the inclusion of charge fluctuations in Hubbard ladders leads to a nontrivial stability regime, revealing a robust yet bounded region where SPT order persists despite significant charge fluctuations. We identify distinct boundaries separating a trivial insulating phase from the Haldane SPT phase, governed by both Coulomb repulsion and Hund's coupling. Our results highlight the subtle interplay of spin and charge degrees of freedom in correlated itinerant systems and establish essential criteria for observing Haldane physics experimentally in fermionic ladder materials.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05089'&gt;arXiv:2507.05089&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 07 Jul 2025 15:12:36 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>An operator algebraic approach to fusion category symmetry on the lattice</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05185</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; David E. Evans, Corey Jones&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We propose a framework for fusion category symmetry on the (1+1)D lattice in the thermodynamic limit by giving a formal interpretation of SymTFT decompositions. Our approach is based on axiomatizing physical boundary subalgebra of quasi-local observables, and applying ideas from algebraic quantum field theory to derive the expected categorical structures. We show that given a physical boundary subalgebra $B$ of a quasi-local algebra $A$, there is a canonical fusion category $\mathcal{C}$ that acts on $A$ by bimodules and whose fusion ring acts by locality preserving quantum channels on the quasi-local algebra such that $B$ is recovered as the invariant operators. We show that a fusion category can be realized as symmetries of a tensor product spin chain if and only if all of its objects have integer dimensions, and that it admits an on-site action on a tensor product spin chain if and only if it admits a fiber functor. We give a formal definition of a topological symmetric state, and prove a Lieb-Schultz-Mattis type theorem. Using this, we show that for any fusion category $\mathcal{C}$ with no fiber functor there always exists gapless pure symmetric states on an anyon chain. Finally, we apply our framework to show that any state covariant under an anomalous Kramers-Wannier type duality must be gapless.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05185'&gt;arXiv:2507.05185&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 07 Jul 2025 16:42:01 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Quantum-Inspired Tensor-Network Fractional-Step Method for Incompressible Flow in Curvilinear Coordinates</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Nis-Luca van Hülst, Pia Siegl, Paul Over, Sergio Bengoechea, Tomohiro Hashizume, Mario Guillaume Cecile, Thomas Rung, Dieter Jaksch&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We introduce an algorithmic framework based on tensor networks for computing fluid flows around immersed objects in curvilinear coordinates. We show that the tensor network simulations can be carried out solely using highly compressed tensor representations of the flow fields and the differential operators and discuss the numerical implementation of the tensor operations required for computing fluid flows in detail. The applicability of our method is demonstrated by applying it to the paradigm example of steady and transient flows around stationary and rotating cylinders. We find excellent quantitative agreement in comparison to finite difference simulations for Strouhal numbers, forces and velocity fields. The properties of our approach are discussed in terms of reduced order models. We estimate the memory saving and potential runtime advantages in comparison to standard finite difference simulations. We find accurate results with errors of less than 0.3% for flow-field compressions by a factor of up to 20 and differential operators compressed by factors of up to 1000 compared to sparse matrix representations. We provide strong numerical evidence that the runtime scaling advantages of the tensor network approach with system size will provide substantial resource savings when simulating larger systems. Finally, we note that, like other tensor network-based fluid flow simulations, our algorithmic framework is directly portable to a quantum computer leading to further scaling advantages.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05222'&gt;arXiv:2507.05222&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 07 Jul 2025 17:33:44 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Tensor network algorithm to solve polaron impurity problems</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Ruofan Chen, Lei Gu, Chu Guo&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The polaron problem is a very old problem in condensed matter physics that dates back to the thirties, but still remain largely unsolved today, especially when electron-electron interaction is taken into consideration. The presence of both electron-electron and electron-phonon interactions in the problem invalidates most existing numerical methods, either computationally too expensive or simply intractable. The continuous time quantum Monte Carlo (CTQMC) methods could tackle this problem, but are only effective in the imaginary-time axis. In this work we present a method based on tensor network and the path integral formalism to solve polaron impurity problems. As both the electron and phonon baths can be integrated out via the Feynman-Vernon influence functional in the path integral formalism, our method is free of bath discretization error. It can also flexibly work on the imaginary, Keldysh, and the L-shaped Kadanoff contour. In addition, our method can naturally resolve several long-existing challenges: (i) non-diagonal hybridization function; (ii) measuring multi-time correlations beyond the single particle Green's functions. We demonstrate the effectiveness and accuracy of our method with extensive numerical examples against analytic solutions, exact diagonalization and CTQMC. We also perform full-fledged real-time calculations that have never been done before to our knowledge, which could be a benchmarking baseline for future method developments.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05580'&gt;arXiv:2507.05580&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 08 Jul 2025 01:33:02 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Wavepacket Propagation Framework via ML-MCTDH for Molecular Reaction Dynamics</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05593</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Xingyu Zhang, Qingyong Meng&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; This work presents a computational framework for studying reaction dynamics via wavepacket propagation, employing the multiconfiguration time-dependent Hartree (MCTDH) method and its multilayer extension (ML-MCTDH) as the core methodologies. The core idea centers on the concept of modes that combine several coordinates along with their hierarchical separations because the degrees of freedom are too numerous to be efficiently treated as a single mode. First, the system is partitioned into several fragments within the same layer, and these fragments are further decomposed. Repeating this process, a hierarchical separation of modes emerges, until modes of a manageable size are achieved. Accordingly, the coordinates frame can be designed hierarchically. Second, the kinetic energy operator (KEO) is derived as a sum-of-products (SOP) of single-particle differential operators through polyspherical approach, while the potential energy surface (PES) is expressed in a similar SOP form of single-particle potentials (SPPs) through (1) reconstruction approaches using an existing PES or (2) direct approaches based on a computed database. Third, the nuclear wave function is expressed in a multi-layer expansion form, where each term is a product of single-particle functions (SPFs) that are further expanded by the SPFs in deeper layer. This expansion form is also adopted by variational eigensolver for electronic wave function. Finally, the Dirac-Frenkel variational principle leads to a set of working equations whose solutions reproduce reaction dynamics. In addition, the hierarchical framework can be rearranged by the mathematical language of tensor network (TN) or tree tensor network (TTN). In this work, we compare the methods represented by function with those in the form of TN or TTN. We also discuss the limitations of the present framework and propose solutions, providing further perspectives.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05593'&gt;arXiv:2507.05593&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 08 Jul 2025 02:04:40 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Matrix-product entanglement characterizing the optimality of state-preparation quantum circuits</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05989</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Shuo Qi, Wen-Jun Li, Gang Su, Shi-Ju Ran&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Multipartite entanglement offers a powerful framework for understanding the complex collective phenomena in quantum many-body systems that are often beyond the description of conventional bipartite entanglement measures. Here, we propose a class of multipartite entanglement measures that incorporate the matrix product state (MPS) representation, enabling the characterization of the optimality of quantum circuits for state preparation. These measures are defined as the minimal distances from a target state to the manifolds of MPSs with specified virtual bond dimensions $\chi$, and thus are dubbed as $\chi$-specified matrix product entanglement ($\chi$-MPE). We demonstrate superlinear, linear, and sublinear scaling behaviors of $\chi$-MPE with respect to the negative logarithmic fidelity $F$ in state preparation, which correspond to excessive, optimal, and insufficient circuit depth $D$ for preparing $\chi$-virtual-dimensional MPSs, respectively. Specifically, a linearly-growing $\chi$-MPE with $F$ suggests $\mathcal{H}_{\chi} \simeq \mathcal{H}_{D}$, where $\mathcal{H}_{\chi}$ denotes the manifold of the $\chi$-virtual-dimensional MPSs and $\mathcal{H}_{D}$ denotes that of the states accessible by the $D$ layer circuits. We provide an exact proof that $\mathcal{H}_{\chi=2} \equiv \mathcal{H}_{D=1}$. Our results establish tensor networks as a powerful and general tool for developing parametrized measures of multipartite entanglement. The matrix product form adopted in $\chi$-MPE can be readily extended to other tensor network ans\"atze, whose scaling behaviors are expected to assess the optimality of quantum circuit in preparing the corresponding tensor network states.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05989'&gt;arXiv:2507.05989&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 08 Jul 2025 13:49:53 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Utility-Scale Quantum Computation of Ground-State Energy in a 100+ Site Planar Kagome Antiferromagnet via Hamiltonian Engineering</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06361</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Muhammad Ahsan&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We present experimental quantum computation of the ground-state energy in a 103-site flat Kagome lattice under the antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model (KAFH), with IBM's Heron r1 and Heron r2 quantum processors. For spin-1/2 KAFH, our per-site ground-state energy estimate is $-0.417\,J$, which, under open-boundary corrections, matches the energy in the thermodynamic limit, i.e., $-0.4386\,J$. To achieve this, we used a hybrid approach that splits the conventional Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) into local (classical) and global (quantum) components for efficient hardware utilization. More importantly, we introduce a Hamiltonian engineering strategy that increases coupling on defect triangles to mimic loop-flip dynamics, allowing us to simplify the ansatz while retaining computational accuracy. Using a single-repetition, hardware-efficient ansatz, we entangle up to 103 qubits with high fidelity to determine the Hamiltonian's lowest eigenvalue. This work demonstrates the scalability of VQE for frustrated 2D systems and lays the foundation for future studies using deeper ansatz circuits and larger lattices on utility quantum processors.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06361'&gt;arXiv:2507.06361&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 08 Jul 2025 19:49:17 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Majorana edge reconstruction and the $ν=5/2$ non-Abelian thermal Hall puzzle</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07161</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Tevž Lotrič, Taige Wang, Michael P. Zaletel, Steven H. Simon, S. A. Parameswaran&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Pioneering thermal transport measurements on two-dimensional electron gases in high magnetic fields have demonstrated that the quantized Hall state at filling factor $\nu=5/2$ has a thermal Hall conductance $\kappa$ quantized in half-integer multiples of $\kappa_0 = {\pi^2 k_B^2 T}/{3h}$. Half-integer $\kappa/\kappa_0$ is a signature of neutral Majorana edge modes, in turn linked to the presence of non-Abelian anyon excitations in the bulk. However, the experimentally observed value of $\kappa$ corresponds to the 'PH-Pfaffian' state, in tension with numerical studies which instead favor either the Pfaffian or the AntiPfaffian. A variety of mechanisms have been invoked to explain this discrepancy, but have been either ruled out by further experiments or else involve fine-tuning. Building on density-matrix-renormalization group studies of physically realistic edges and analytic calculations of edge structure, we propose an alternative resolution of this puzzle involving an 'edge reconstruction' solely involving the neutral Majorana sector of the theory. Such a Majorana edge reconstruction can "screen'' a Pfaffian or AntiPfaffian bulk, so that transport signatures become indistinguishable from those of the PH-Pfaffian. We argue that this physically natural scenario is consistent with experiment.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07161'&gt;arXiv:2507.07161&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 09 Jul 2025 18:00:00 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Energy Spectra of Compressed Quantum States</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Daochen Wang&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Quantum algorithms for estimating the ground state energy of a quantum system often operate by preparing a classically accessible quantum state and then applying quantum phase estimation. Whether this approach yields quantum advantage hinges on the state's energy spectrum, that is, the sequence of the state's overlaps with the energy eigenstates of the system Hamiltonian. For any entanglement-compressed quantum state with minimal expected energy, it is shown that its energy spectrum decays at most with the inverse-squared energy eigenvalues. This explains the main empirical finding of Silvester, Carleo, and White (Physical Review Letters, 2025) that the energy spectra of matrix product states do not decay exponentially. It also reduces the question of quantum advantage to the energy and entanglement profile of the Hamiltonian's eigenstates.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07191'&gt;arXiv:2507.07191&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 09 Jul 2025 18:02:41 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Finitely Correlated States Driven by Topological Dynamics</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Eric B. Roon, Jeffrey H. Schenker&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Let $(\Omega, \P)$ be a standard probability space and let $\vartheta:\Omega \to \Omega$ be a measure preserving ergodic homeomorphism. Let $\mathcal{A}$ be a $C^*$-algebra with a unit and let $\mathcal{A}_{\mathbb{Z}}$ be the quasi-local algebra associated to the spin chain with one-site algebra $\mathcal{A}$. Equip $\mathcal{A}_{\mathbb{Z}}$ with the group action of translation by $k$-units, $\tau_k\in Aut(\mathcal{A}_{\mathbb{Z}})$ for $k\in \mathbb{Z}$. We study the problem of finding a disordered matrix product state decomposition for disordered states $\psi(\omega)$ on $\mathcal{A}_{\mathbb{Z}}$ with the covariance symmetry condition $\psi(\omega) \circ \tau_k = \psi(\vartheta^k \omega)$. This can be seen as an ergodic generalization of the results of Fannes, Nachtergaele, and Werner \cite{FannesNachtergaeleWerner}. To reify our structure theory, we present a disordered state $\nu_\omega$ obtained by sampling the AKLT model \cite{AKLT} in parameter space. We go on to show that $\nu_\omega$ has a nearest-neighbor parent Hamiltonian, its bulk spectral gap closes, but it has almost surely exponentially decaying correlations, and finally, that $\nu_\omega$ is time-reversal symmetry protected with a Tasaki index of $-1$.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07287'&gt;arXiv:2507.07287&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 09 Jul 2025 21:13:57 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Tangent Space Excitation Ansatz for Quantum Circuits</title>

Zhou, Norbert Schuch, Chenfeng Cao, Muchun Yang&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Computing the excitation spectra of quantum many-body systems on noisy quantum devices is a promising avenue to demonstrate the practical utility of current quantum processors, especially as we move toward the ``megaquop'' regime. For this task, here we introduce a \textit{tangent-space excitation ansatz} for quantum circuits, motivated by the quasi-particle picture of many-body systems and the structural similarity between quantum circuits and classical tensor networks. Increasing the circuit depth by one layer to construct the tangent space around the variational optimum of a parametrized quantum circuit, we show that a large number of low-energy states can be accurately captured. We demonstrate this ansatz using various models in both one and two spatial dimensions, including the challenging kagome Heisenberg antiferromagnet. We further provide evidence that this approach, implementable using Hadamard test, is stable in the presence of measurement noise and scalable to large system size.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07646'&gt;arXiv:2507.07646&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 10 Jul 2025 11:22:13 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Evolution from intralayer to interlayer superconductivity in a bilayer $t$-$J$ model</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07545</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Yuan Yang, Xin Lu, Yuan Wan, Wei-Qiang Chen, Shou-Shu Gong&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Motivated by the bilayer cuprate superconductors and nickelate superconductor La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, we investigate the evolution from intralayer to interlayer superconductivity based on a bilayer two-leg $t$-$J$-$J_{\bot}$ model, where $t$ is the in-plane electron hopping, $J$ is the in-plane spin interaction, and $J_{\bot}$ is the inter-plane spin interaction. By means of the density matrix renormalization group calculations, we obtain the quantum phase diagram of the system by tuning $J_{\bot}$ in a large doping range $\delta = 1/8 - 1/2$. We find that a large $J_{\bot}$ can always drive an interlayer superconductivity by coupling the two layers in both the Luther-Emery liquid and Luttinger liquid states. By coupling two Luther-Emery liquid states, the in-plane superconductivity evolves to inter-plane superconductivity either through an intermediate charge density wave (CDW) phase or directly, depending on doping ratio. This emergent CDW phase, which exists over a finite doping range, appears to develop from the CDW state of the two-leg ladder at $\delta = 1/4$. By coupling two Luttinger liquids, the in-plane Luttinger liquids show a transition to the inter-plane superconducting phase at large $J_{\bot}$, as reported in previous literature. Interestingly, in the intermediate $J_{\bot}$ regime we find that while the in-plane Luttinger-liquid features remain stable, the inter-plane superconductivity can develop an enhanced quasi-long-range order with the power exponent $K^{zz}_{\rm SC} \sim 1$. At last, we show that the interlayer superconductivity is also stable by coupling the bilayer three-leg $t$-$J$ ladders by a strong $J_{\bot}$ interaction, from both the Luther-Emery liquid and Luttinger-liquid states.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07545'&gt;arXiv:2507.07545&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 10 Jul 2025 08:38:50 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Emergent QED$_3$ at the bosonic Laughlin state to superfluid transition</title>

Senthil&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Quantum phase transitions between topologically ordered and symmetry-broken phases lie beyond Landau theory. A prime example is the conjectured continuous transition from the bosonic $\nu = 1/2$ Laughlin state to a superfluid, proposed to be governed by a QED$_3$--Chern--Simons (CS) critical point whose stability remains uncertain. We study half-filled bosons in the lowest Landau level subject to a lattice potential. Infinite-cylinder DMRG reveals a single continuous Laughlin--to--superfluid transition. Adiabatic flux insertion collapses the many-body gap and exposes massless Dirac quasiparticles, while momentum-resolved correlation lengths show that three lattice-related density modes share the same critical exponent, evidencing an emergent $SO(3)$ symmetry. The joint appearance of Dirac dispersion and symmetry enlargement provides microscopic support for a stable QED$_3$--CS fixed point. Our numerical strategy also offers a blueprint for exploring Landau-forbidden transitions in fractional Chern insulators and composite Fermi liquids realised in moire and cold-atom systems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07611'&gt;arXiv:2507.07611&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 10 Jul 2025 10:29:17 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

We establish the effectiveness of our method by benchmarking the calculated polaron spectral function in one dimension against available results. We further demonstrate its potential by presenting the polaron spectral function in two dimensions and simulating polaron diffusion in both one and two dimensions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07648'&gt;arXiv:2507.07648&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 10 Jul 2025 11:22:53 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

This framework is broadly applicable to any method that can compute real-time dynamics, offering a powerful and versatile tool for investigating nonlinear responses in dynamical systems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07679'&gt;arXiv:2507.07679&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 10 Jul 2025 12:00:00 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Quench spectroscopy for Lieb-Liniger bosons in the presence of harmonic trap</title>

While its efficacy has been demonstrated in the homogeneous systems theoretically, most experimental setups feature a confining potential, such as a harmonic trap, which complicates the practical implementations. In this work, we experimentally probe the quench spectroscopy for one-dimensional bosons in optical lattices with the presence of a harmonic trap, and comparing our results with the density matrix renormalization group simulation. For the Mott insulator phase, although a gap is still observed, the band signal is broadened along the frequency space and cut at the half Brillouin zone, which can be explained by the excitations under harmonic confinement. Comparing with the superfluid spectrum, we can see a clear distinction between the two phases and find the inverse quench with larger amplitude yields the clearest spectrum. Our work offers pivotal insights into conducting quench spectroscopy effectively in practical systems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07699'&gt;arXiv:2507.07699&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 10 Jul 2025 12:23:34 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Chiral superconductivity near a fractional Chern insulator</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Taige Wang, Michael P. Zaletel&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Superconductivity arising from fully spin-polarized, repulsively interacting electrons can host intrinsically chiral Cooper pairs and Majorana zero modes, yet no concrete microscopic route to such a state has been established. Motivated by recent observations in twisted homobilayer MoTe$_2$ and rhombohedral pentalayer graphene, where fractional Chern insulators (FCIs) appear adjacent to spin-valley-polarized superconductors, we investigate a minimal model: spinless electrons in the lowest Landau level subject to a tunable periodic potential. Large-scale density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) calculations reveal that, as the FCI gap closes, two nearly degenerate phases emerge before the system turns metallic: a chiral $f$-wave superconductor and a $\sqrt{3} \times \sqrt{3}$ charge-density wave (CDW) whose energies differ by less than $1\%$. These two competing states mirror the superconducting and re-entrant integer quantum Hall (RIQH) phases observed experimentally near the FCI regime. The superconducting dome survives realistic Coulomb interaction, light doping, and various lattice geometry. Melting the FCI therefore provides a new mechanism for realizing spin-polarized chiral superconductivity and RIQH order. We predict that twisted MoTe$_2$ at larger twist angles will develop a superconducting dome even at filling $\nu = 2/3$, and suppressing this superconductivity with a magnetic field should drive the system into an RIQH state.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07921'&gt;arXiv:2507.07921&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 10 Jul 2025 17:02:41 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

Here, we introduce an alternative isometric form for isoTPS by incorporating auxiliary tensors to represent the orthogonality hypersurface. We implement the time evolving block decimation (TEBD) algorithm on this new isometric form and benchmark the method by computing ground states and the real time evolution of the transverse field Ising model in two dimensions on large square lattices of up to 1250 sites. Our results demonstrate that isoTPS can efficiently capture the entanglement structure of two-dimensional area law states. The short-time dynamics is also accurately reproduced even at the critical point. Our isoTPS formulation further allows for a natural extension to different lattice geometries, such as the honeycomb or kagome latice.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08080'&gt;arXiv:2507.08080&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 10 Jul 2025 18:00:03 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

We probe string modes of motion with dynamical matter in a digital quantum simulation of a (2+1) dimensional gauge theory using a superconducting quantum processor with up to 144 qubits, stretching the hardware capabilities with quantum-circuit depths comprising up to 192 two-qubit layers. We realize the $Z_2$-Higgs model ($Z_2$HM) through an optimized embedding into a heavy-hex superconducting qubit architecture, directly mapping matter and gauge fields to vertex and link superconducting qubits, respectively. Using the structure of local gauge symmetries, we implement a comprehensive suite of error suppression, mitigation, and correction strategies to enable real-time observation and manipulation of electric strings connecting dynamical charges. Our results resolve a dynamical hierarchy of longitudinal oscillations and transverse bending at the end points of the string, which are precursors to hadronization and rotational spectra of mesons. We further explore multi-string processes, observing the fragmentation and recombination of strings. The experimental design supports 300,000 measurement shots per circuit, totaling 600,000 shots per time step, enabling high-fidelity statistics. We employ extensive tensor network simulations using the basis update and Galerkin method to predict large-scale real-time dynamics and validate our error-aware protocols. This work establishes a milestone for probing non-perturbative gauge dynamics via superconducting quantum simulation and elucidates the real-time behavior of confining strings.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08088'&gt;arXiv:2507.08088&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 10 Jul 2025 18:01:27 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Tensor train representations of Greeks for Fourier-based pricing of multi-asset options</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08482</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Rihito Sakurai, Koichi Miyamoto, Tsuyoshi Okubo&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Efficient computation of Greeks for multi-asset options remains a key challenge in quantitative finance. While Monte Carlo (MC) simulation is widely used, it suffers from the large sample complexity for high accuracy. We propose a framework to compute Greeks in a single evaluation of a tensor train (TT), which is obtained by compressing the Fourier transform (FT)-based pricing function via TT learning using tensor cross interpolation. Based on this TT representation, we introduce two approaches to compute Greeks: a numerical differentiation (ND) approach that applies a numerical differential operator to one tensor core and an analytical (AN) approach that constructs the TT of closed-form differentiation expressions of FT-based pricing. Numerical experiments on a five-asset min-call option in the Black-Sholes model show significant speed-ups of up to about $10^{5} \times$ over MC while maintaining comparable accuracy. The ND approach matches or exceeds the accuracy of the AN approach and requires lower computational complexity for constructing the TT representation, making it the preferred choice.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08482'&gt;arXiv:2507.08482&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 11 Jul 2025 10:51:17 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Symmetry-based theory of Dirac fermions on two-dimensional hyperbolic crystals: Coupling to the spin connection</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08276</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Ana Djordjević, Marija Dimitrijević Ćirić, Vladimir Juričić&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Discrete fermionic and bosonic models for hyperbolic lattices have attracted significant attention across a range of fields since the experimental realization of hyperbolic lattices in metamaterial platforms, sparking the development of hyperbolic crystallography. However, a fundamental and experimentally consequential aspect remains unaddressed: fermions propagating in curved space inherently couple to the underlying geometry via the spin connection, as required by general covariance - a feature not yet incorporated in studies of hyperbolic crystals. Here, we introduce a symmetry-based framework for Dirac fermions on two-dimensional hyperbolic lattices, explicitly incorporating spin-curvature coupling via a discrete spin connection. Starting from the continuous symmetries of the Poincar\'e disk, we classify the irreducible representations and construct a symmetry-adapted basis, establishing a direct correspondence to the continuum Dirac theory. We show that this continuum theory predicts a finite density of states at zero energy for any finite curvature in $D-$dimensional hyperbolic space with $2\leq D \leq 4$, suggesting enhanced susceptibility of Dirac fermions to interaction-driven instabilities at weak coupling. We then derive explicit forms of discrete translational and rotational symmetries for lattices characterized by Schl\"afli symbols $\{p,q\}$, and explicitly construct the discrete spin connection, represented as hopping phases, via parallel transport. Our results pave the way for experimental realization of spin-curvature effects in metamaterial platforms and systematic numerical studies of correlated Dirac phases in hyperbolic geometries.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08276'&gt;arXiv:2507.08276&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 11 Jul 2025 02:50:00 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Emergent Distance from Mutual Information in the Critical 1D XXZ Spin Chain</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09749</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Beau Leighton-Trudel&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The possibility that spatial geometry may emerge from the entanglement structure of a quantum many-body system is a subject of fundamental interest. Here, we propose and numerically test a candidate distance metric in 1D, d_E, defined purely from quantum mutual information (I) via the relation d_E = K_0 / sqrt(I). Using large-scale density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations, we compute this emergent distance for the ground state of the 1D spin-1/2 XXZ chain, a canonical model system. Our simulations show that in the quantum critical phase at anisotropy $\Delta = 1.0$, the mutual information exhibits a power-law decay consistent with the emergence of a valid metric space. In stark contrast, within the gapped, antiferromagnetic phase ($\Delta = 2.0$), where mutual information decays exponentially, the emergent distance grows exponentially, a behavior inconsistent with the triangle inequality. These results provide numerical evidence that this information-theoretic definition can yield a well-behaved geometry in critical systems, offering a quantitative tool for probing quantum phases and motivating further analytical investigation into the foundations of emergent space.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09749'&gt;arXiv:2507.09749&lt;/a&gt;] Published Sun, 13 Jul 2025 19:00:06 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Intertwined charge, spin, and orbital degrees of freedom under electronic correlations in the one-dimensional Fe$^{3+}$ chalcogenide chain</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Yang Zhang, Pontus Laurell, Gonzalo Alvarez, Adriana Moreo, Thomas A. Maier, Ling-Fang Lin, Elbio Dagotto&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Motivated by recent developments in the study of quasi-one-dimensional iron systems with Fe$^{2+}$, we comprehensively study the Fe$^{3+}$ chalcogenide chain system. Based on first-principles calculations, the Fe$^{3+}$ chain has a similar electronic structure as discussed before in the iron 2+ chain, due to similar Fe$X_4$ ($X$ = S or Se) tetrahedron chain geometry. Furthermore, a three-orbital electronic Hubbard model for this chain was constructed by using the density matrix renormalization group method. A robust antiferromagnetic coupling was unveiled in the chain direction. In addition, in the intermediate electronic correlation $U/W$ region, we found an interesting orbital-selective Mott phase with the coexistence of localized and itinerant electrons ($U$ is the on-site Hubbard repulsion, while $W$ is the electronic bandwidth). Furthermore, we do not observe any obvious pairing tendency in the Fe$^{3+}$ chain in the electronic correlation $U/W$ region, where superconducting pairing tendencies were reported before in iron ladders. This suggests that superconductivity is unlikely to emerge in the Fe$^{3+}$ systems. Our results establish with clarity the similarities and differences between Fe$^{2+}$and Fe$^{3+}$ iron chains, as well as iron ladders.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09870'&gt;arXiv:2507.09870&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 14 Jul 2025 02:50:40 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Understanding the Rank of Tensor Networks via an Intuitive Example-Driven Approach</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10170</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Wuyang Zhou, Giorgos Iacovides, Kriton Konstantinidis, Ilya Kisil, Danilo Mandic&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Tensor Network (TN) decompositions have emerged as an indispensable tool in Big Data analytics owing to their ability to provide compact low-rank representations, thus alleviating the ``Curse of Dimensionality'' inherent in handling higher-order data. At the heart of their success lies the concept of TN ranks, which governs the efficiency and expressivity of TN decompositions. However, unlike matrix ranks, TN ranks often lack a universal meaning and an intuitive interpretation, with their properties varying significantly across different TN structures. Consequently, TN ranks are frequently treated as empirically tuned hyperparameters, rather than as key design parameters inferred from domain knowledge. The aim of this Lecture Note is therefore to demystify the foundational yet frequently misunderstood concept of TN ranks through real-life examples and intuitive visualizations. We begin by illustrating how domain knowledge can guide the selection of TN ranks in widely-used models such as the Canonical Polyadic (CP) and Tucker decompositions. For more complex TN structures, we employ a self-explanatory graphical approach that generalizes to tensors of arbitrary order. Such a perspective naturally reveals the relationship between TN ranks and the corresponding ranks of tensor unfoldings (matrices), thereby circumventing cumbersome multi-index tensor algebra while facilitating domain-informed TN design. It is our hope that this Lecture Note will equip readers with a clear and unified understanding of the concept of TN rank, along with the necessary physical insight and intuition to support the selection, explainability, and deployment of tensor methods in both practical applications and educational contexts.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10170'&gt;arXiv:2507.10170&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 14 Jul 2025 11:33:14 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Natural super-orbitals representation of many-body operators</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10690</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Maxime Debertolis&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We introduce the concept of natural super-orbitals for many-body operators, defined as the eigenvectors of the one-body super-density matrix associated with a vectorized operator. We relate these objects to measures of non-Gaussianity of operators associated to the occupations of the natural super-orbitals, and define how the non-stabilizerness of operators can be affected by such a basis rotation. We first analyze the general analytical properties of these objects in various contexts, including the time-evolution operator of non-interacting Hamiltonians and Haar-random unitaries. We then perform a numerical investigation of the natural super-orbitals corresponding to both the time-evolution operator and a time-evolved local operator, focusing on two many-body systems: the fermionic $t\text{-}V$ chain and an impurity model, using tensor network simulations. Our results reveal that the $t\text{-}V$ model lacks a preferred super-orbital basis, while in the impurity model, the occupations of the natural orbitals for both operators decay exponentially at all times. This indicates that only a small number of orbitals contribute significantly to quantum correlations, enabling a compact matrix-product-operator representation and a reduced non-stabilizerness in the natural orbital basis. Finally, we examine the spatial spread of the natural orbitals for time-evolved local operators in the impurity model and show that the complexity of this operator in the natural orbital basis saturates over time. This new framework opens the door to future research that leverages the compressed structure of operators in their natural super-orbital basis, enabling for instance the computation of out-of-time-order correlators in large interacting systems over extended time scales.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10690'&gt;arXiv:2507.10690&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 14 Jul 2025 18:04:53 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>An Optimization-Free Recursive QAOA for the Binary Paint Shop Problem</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10908</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Gary J Mooney, Jedwin Villanueva, Bhaskar Roy Radhan, Joydip Ghosh, Charles D Hill, Lloyd C L Hollenberg&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The classical outer optimisation loop of the classical-quantum hybrid Quantum Approximate Optimisation Algorithm (QAOA) can be bypassed by transferring precomputed parameters to larger unseen problem instances using the parameter concentration property found in certain classes of problem instances. In this paper, parameter transfer is applied to the recursive-QAOA (RQAOA) approach of Bravyi et al. implementing the Binary Paint Shop Problem (BPSP) -- an optimisation problem found in manufacturing where a sequence of cars are to be painted under certain constraints while minimising the number of colour changes between cars. The BPSP can be conveniently formulated as an Ising ground state problem with a symmetric Hamiltonian and Ising graph structure that is well-suited for QAOA parameter-transfer techniques. Throughout our quantum simulated experiments, parameter transfer showed no noticeable reduction in solution quality over optimisation for QAOA and RQAOA while substantially improving the efficiency due to avoiding measurements required for optimisation. Additionally, RQAOA only requires measurements of $ZZ$-correlations instead of full statevectors, benefiting from the reverse-causal-cone feature that leads to circuits with significantly lower CNOT counts and depths. The performance of QAOA and RQAOA with parameter transfer is benchmarked against classical solvers and heuristics and their resilience to non-optimal parameters is explored. The entanglement entropy and bond dimensions are obtained from matrix product state simulations to provide an indication of the classical resources required to simulate the quantum algorithms. Circuit sizes and measurement counts are compared between the implementations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10908'&gt;arXiv:2507.10908&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 15 Jul 2025 01:54:11 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Diagnosing phase transitions through time scale entanglement</title>

This quantics tensor train diagnostics approach allows us to i) identify quantum phase transitions (ground state crossings) and thermal crossovers, ii) distinguish between these two by allowing flexibility through iii) using arbitrary available correlators and iv) the possibility to deal with low-accuracy input data through varying the quantics tensor train cutoffs. We verify the validity of the approach by studying the phase diagram of the Hubbard dimer, the four-site Hubbard ring with and without next-nearest neighbor hopping and the single-impurity Anderson model. We find time scale entanglement to be a system-inherent property becoming maximal at phase transitions and crossover, which translates to peaks in the quantics tensor train bond dimension of correlator functions. Additionally, the connection of the method to other physical quantities, such as various entanglement measures and susceptibilities, is shown.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11276'&gt;arXiv:2507.11276&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 15 Jul 2025 12:53:27 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Interpretable Bayesian Tensor Network Kernel Machines with Automatic Rank and Feature Selection</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11136</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Afra Kilic, Kim Batselier&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Tensor Network (TN) Kernel Machines speed up model learning by representing parameters as low-rank TNs, reducing computation and memory use. However, most TN-based Kernel methods are deterministic and ignore parameter uncertainty. Further, they require manual tuning of model complexity hyperparameters like tensor rank and feature dimensions, often through trial-and-error or computationally costly methods like cross-validation. We propose Bayesian Tensor Network Kernel Machines, a fully probabilistic framework that uses sparsity-inducing hierarchical priors on TN factors to automatically infer model complexity. This enables automatic inference of tensor rank and feature dimensions, while also identifying the most relevant features for prediction, thereby enhancing model interpretability. All the model parameters and hyperparameters are treated as latent variables with corresponding priors. Given the Bayesian approach and latent variable dependencies, we apply a mean-field variational inference to approximate their posteriors. We show that applying a mean-field approximation to TN factors yields a Bayesian ALS algorithm with the same computational complexity as its deterministic counterpart, enabling uncertainty quantification at no extra computational cost. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our model in prediction accuracy, uncertainty quantification, interpretability, and scalability.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11136'&gt;arXiv:2507.11136&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 15 Jul 2025 09:37:49 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Simulating and Sampling from Quantum Circuits with 2D Tensor Networks</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11424</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Manuel S. Rudolph, Joseph Tindall&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Classical simulations of quantum circuits play a vital role in the development of quantum computers and for taking the temperature of the field. Here, we classically simulate various physically-motivated circuits using 2D tensor network ans\"atze for the many-body wavefunction which match the geometry of the underlying quantum processor. We then employ a generalized version of the boundary Matrix Product State contraction algorithm to controllably generate samples from the resultant tensor network states. Our approach allows us to systematically converge both the quality of the final state and the samples drawn from it to the true distribution defined by the circuit. With these methods, we simulate the largest local unitary Jastrow ansatz circuit taken from recent IBM experiments to numerical precision. We also study a domain-wall quench in a two-dimensional discrete-time Heisenberg model on large heavy-hex and rotated square lattices, which reflect IBM's and Google's latest quantum processors respectively. We observe a rapid buildup of complex loop correlations on the Google Willow geometry which significantly impact the local properties of the system. Meanwhile, we find loop correlations build up extremely slowly on heavy-hex processors and have almost negligible impact on the local properties of the system, even at large circuit depths. Our results underscore the role the geometry of the quantum processor plays in classical simulability.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11424'&gt;arXiv:2507.11424&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 15 Jul 2025 15:50:02 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Fractal Path Strategies for Efficient 2D DMRG Simulations</title>

Munro&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Numerical simulations of quantum magnetism in two spatial dimensions are often constrained by the area law of entanglement entropy, which heavily limits the accessible system sizes in tensor network methods. In this work, we investigate how the choice of mapping from a two-dimensional lattice to a one-dimensional path affects the accuracy of the two-dimensional Density Matrix Renormalization Group algorithm. We systematically evaluate all mappings corresponding to a subset of the Hamiltonian paths of the $N \cross N$ grid graphs up to $N=8$ and demonstrate that the fractal space-filling curves generally lead to faster convergence in ground state searches compared to the commonly used ``snake" path. To explain this performance gain, we analyze various locality metrics and propose a scalable method for constructing high-performing paths on larger lattices by tiling smaller optimal paths. Our results show that such paths consistently improve simulation convergence, with the advantage increasing with system size.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11820'&gt;arXiv:2507.11820&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 16 Jul 2025 00:41:18 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>QAS-QTNs: Curriculum Reinforcement Learning-Driven Quantum Architecture Search for Quantum Tensor Networks</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12013</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Siddhant Dutta, Nouhaila Innan, Sadok Ben Yahia, Muhammad Shafique&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Quantum Architecture Search (QAS) is an emerging field aimed at automating the design of quantum circuits for optimal performance. This paper introduces a novel QAS framework employing hybrid quantum reinforcement learning with quantum curriculum learning strategies, enabling learning agents to tackle increasingly complex quantum circuit design tasks. We benchmark four state-of-the-art classical reinforcement learning algorithms (A2C, PPO, DDQN, TD3) against their quantum-enhanced counterparts (QA2C, QPPO, QDDQN, QTD3) for optimizing variational quantum circuits (VQCs). Our approach progressively increases circuit depth and gate complexity during training, leveraging parameterized quantum circuits as function approximations. To improve learning efficiency and stability, all algorithms, both classical and quantum, are augmented with Prioritized Experience Replay (PER). Experimental results show that quantum-enhanced RL significantly outperforms classical methods. In a 2-qubit environment, PERQDDQN achieves a success probability of 0.46 with ~3,000 optimal successes, surpassing classical PERDDQN (0.42, ~2,400). In the more complex 3-qubit setting, PERQDDQN and PERQTD3 reach success probabilities of ~0.47, with optimal success counts of ~3,800 and ~3,600, respectively, outperforming their classical counterparts. Additionally, we apply our QAS-QTN approach to a classification problem, where the optimized quantum circuit achieves an accuracy of 90.33\%, outperforming quantum models consisting of random ansatz. This hybrid classical-quantum approach leads to faster convergence and more efficient quantum circuit designs, demonstrating its potential for advancing automated quantum architecture search.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12013'&gt;arXiv:2507.12013&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 16 Jul 2025 08:12:01 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Spacetime duality between sequential and measurement-feedback circuits</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12523</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Tsung-Cheng Lu, Sarang Gopalakrishnan, Yizhi You&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Two prevalent approaches for preparing long-range entangled quantum states are (i) linear-depth sequential unitary (SU) circuits, which apply local unitary gates sequentially, and (ii) constant-depth measurement-feedback (MF) circuits, which employ mid-circuit measurements and conditional feedback based on measurement outcomes. Here, we establish that a broad class of SU and MF circuits are dual to each other under a spacetime rotation. We investigate this spacetime duality in the preparation of various long-range entangled states, including GHZ states, topologically ordered states, and fractal symmetry-breaking states. As an illustration, applying a spacetime rotation to a linear-depth SU circuit that implements a non-invertible Kramers-Wannier duality, originally used to prepare a 1D GHZ state, yields a constant-depth MF circuit that implements a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry gauging map, which equivalently prepares the GHZ state. Leveraging this duality, we further propose experimental protocols that require only a constant number of qubits to measure unconventional properties of 1D many-body states. These include (i) measurement of disorder operators, which diagnose the absence of spontaneous symmetry breaking, and (ii) postselection-free detection of measurement-induced long-range order, which emerges in certain symmetry-protected topological phases. We also show that measurement-induced long-range order provides a lower bound for strange correlators, which may be of independent interest.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12523'&gt;arXiv:2507.12523&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 16 Jul 2025 18:00:01 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

Ignacio Cirac, Peter Zoller, Maksym Serbyn, Lorenzo Piroli, Benoît Vermersch&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We present and test a protocol to learn the matrix-product operator (MPO) representation of an experimentally prepared quantum state. The protocol takes as an input classical shadows corresponding to local randomized measurements, and outputs the tensors of a MPO which maximizes a suitably-defined fidelity with the experimental state. The tensor optimization is carried out sequentially, similarly to the well-known density matrix renormalization group algorithm. Our approach is provably efficient under certain technical conditions which are expected to be met in short-range correlated states and in typical noisy experimental settings. Under the same conditions, we also provide an efficient scheme to estimate fidelities between the learned and the experimental states. We experimentally demonstrate our protocol by learning entangled quantum states of up to $N = 96$ qubits in a superconducting quantum processor. Our method upgrades classical shadows to large-scale quantum computation and simulation experiments.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12550'&gt;arXiv:2507.12550&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 16 Jul 2025 18:01:36 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Scalable tensor network algorithm for quantum impurity problems</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12722</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Zhijie Sun, Ruofan Chen, Zhenyu Li, Chu Guo&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The Grassmann time-evolving matrix product operator method has shown great potential as a general-purpose quantum impurity solver, as its numerical errors can be well-controlled and it is flexible to be applied on both the imaginary- and real-time axis. However, a major limitation of it is that its computational cost grows exponentially with the number of impurity flavors. In this work, we propose a multi-flavor extension of it to overcome this limitation. The key insight is that to calculate multi-time correlation functions on one or a few impurity flavors, one could integrate out the degrees of freedom of the rest flavors before hand, which could greatly simplify the calculation. The idea is particularly effective for quantum impurity problems with diagonal hybridization function, i.e., each impurity flavor is coupled to an independent bath, a setting which is commonly used in the field. We demonstrate the accuracy and scalability of our method for the imaginary time evolution of impurity problems with up to three impurity orbitals, i.e., 6 flavors, and benchmark our results against continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo calculations. Our method paves the way of scaling up tensor network algorithms to solve large-scale quantum impurity problems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12722'&gt;arXiv:2507.12722&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 17 Jul 2025 01:59:21 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Higher Structures on Boundary Conformal Manifolds: Higher Berry Phase and Boundary Conformal Field Theory</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12525</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Yichul Choi, Hyunsoo Ha, Dongyeob Kim, Yuya Kusuki, Shuhei Ohyama, Shinsei Ryu&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We introduce the notion of higher Berry connection and curvature in the space of conformal boundary conditions in (1+1)d conformal field theories (CFT), related to each other by exactly marginal boundary deformations, forming a "boundary conformal manifold." Our definition builds upon previous works on tensor networks, such as matrix product states (MPS), where the triple inner product or multi-wavefunction overlap plays the key geometric role. On the one hand, our boundary conformal field theory (BCFT) formulation of higher Berry phase provides a new analytic tool to study families of invertible phases in condensed matter systems. On the other hand, it uncovers a new geometric structure on the moduli space of conformal boundary conditions, beyond the usual Riemannian structure defined through the Zamolodchikov metric. When the boundary conformal manifold has an interpretation as the position moduli space of a D-brane, our higher Berry connection coincides with the NS-NS $B$-field in string theory. The general definition does not require such an interpretation and is formulated purely field-theoretically, in terms of correlation functions of boundary-condition-changing (bcc) operators. We also explore a connection between higher Berry connections and functional Berry connections in the loop spaces of boundary conformal manifolds.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12525'&gt;arXiv:2507.12525&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 16 Jul 2025 18:00:01 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Robustness of Magic in the quantum Ising chain via Quantum Monte Carlo tomography</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12902</link>

In order to quantify the magic of partitions rigorously, we formulate a hybrid scheme that combines stochastic sampling of reduced density matrices via quantum Monte Carlo, with state-of-the-art estimators for the robustness of magic - a {\it bona fide} measure of magic for mixed states. This allows us to compute the mutual robustness of magic for partitions up to 8 sites, embedded into a much larger system. We show how mutual robustness is directly related to critical behaviors: at the critical point, it displays a power law decay as a function of the distance between partitions, whose exponent is related to the partition size. Once finite temperature is included, mutual magic retains its low temperature value up to an effective critical temperature, whose dependence on size is also algebraic. This suggests that magic, differently from entanglement, does not necessarily undergo a sudden death.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12902'&gt;arXiv:2507.12902&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 17 Jul 2025 08:41:53 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

Nepomechie&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Dicke states are permutation-invariant superpositions of qubit computational basis states, which play a prominent role in quantum information science. We consider here two higher-dimensional generalizations of these states: $SU(2)$ spin-$s$ Dicke states and $SU(d)$ Dicke states. We present various ways of preparing both types of qudit Dicke states on a qudit quantum computer, using two main approaches: a deterministic approach, based on exact canonical matrix product state representations; and a probabilistic approach, based on quantum phase estimation. The quantum circuits are explicit and straightforward, and are arguably simpler than those previously reported.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13308'&gt;arXiv:2507.13308&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 17 Jul 2025 17:27:26 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Quantifying mixed-state entanglement via partial transpose and realignment moments</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13840</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Poetri Sonya Tarabunga, Tobias Haug&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Entanglement plays a crucial role in quantum information science and many-body physics, yet quantifying it in mixed quantum many-body systems has remained a notoriously difficult problem. Here, we introduce families of quantitative entanglement witnesses, constructed from partial transpose and realignment moments, which provide rigorous bounds on entanglement monotones. Our witnesses can be efficiently measured using SWAP tests or variants of Bell measurements, thus making them directly implementable on current hardware. Leveraging our witnesses, we present several novel results on entanglement properties of mixed states, both in quantum information and many-body physics. We develop efficient algorithms to test whether mixed states with bounded entropy have low or high entanglement, which previously was only possible for pure states. We also provide an efficient algorithm to test the Schmidt rank using only two-copy measurements, and to test the operator Schmidt rank using four-copy measurements. Further, our witnesses enable robust certification of quantum circuit depth even in the presence of noise, a task which so far has been limited to noiseless circuits only. Finally, we show that the entanglement phase diagram of Haar random states, quantified by the partial transpose negativity, can be fully established solely by computing our witness, a result that also applies to any state 4-design. Our witnesses can also be efficiently computed for matrix product states, thus enabling the characterization of entanglement in extensive many-body systems. Finally, we make progress on the entanglement required for quantum cryptography, establishing rigorous limits on pseudoentanglement and pseudorandom density matrices with bounded entropy. Our work opens new avenues for quantifying entanglement in large and noisy quantum systems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13840'&gt;arXiv:2507.13840&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 18 Jul 2025 11:53:39 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Exploring near critical lattice gauge simulators with Rydberg atoms facilities</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Avi Kaufman, Muhammad Asaduzzaman, Zane Ozzello, Blake Senseman, James Corona, Yannick Meurice&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We motivate the use of a ladder of Rydberg atoms as an analog simulator for a lattice gauge theory version of scalar electrodynamics also called the compact Abelian Higgs model. We demonstrate that by using a few thousand shots from a single copy of the ladder simulator it is possible to estimate the bipartite quantum von Neumann entanglement entropy $S^{vN}_A$. The estimation relies on an optimized filtration of the mutual information associated with the bitstrings obtained from public facilities of configurable Rydberg arrays named Aquila. We discuss the limitations associated with finite sampling, sorting fidelity, adiabatic preparation, ramp-down of the Rabi frequency before measurement, and readout errors. We use cumulative probability distribution to compare Aquila results with high accuracy density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) or exact results. The state preparation appears to be the main source of error. We discuss the large volume behavior of the cumulative probability distribution and show examples where for a finite number of shots, there appears to be some large enough size for which, with high probability, any given state is seen at most once. We show that the results presented can be extended to multipartite entanglement. We briefly discuss the cost of the calculations for large square arrays in the context of obtaining quantum advantage in the near future.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14128'&gt;arXiv:2507.14128&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 18 Jul 2025 17:56:03 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Learning the non-Markovian features of subsystem dynamics</title>

The problem is that the bath representing the complement of the local subsystem generally does not allow the common simplifications often crucial for such a framework. Leveraging tensor network calculations and optimization tools from machine learning, we extract and characterize the dynamical maps for single- and two-site subsystems embedded in an infinite quantum Ising chain after a global quench. We consider three paradigmatic regimes: integrable critical, integrable non-critical, and chaotic. For each we find the optimal time-local representation of the subsystem dynamics at different times. We explore the properties of the learned time-dependent Liouvillians and whether they can be used to forecast the long-time dynamics of local observables beyond the times accessible through direct quantum many-body numerical simulation. Our procedure naturally suggests a novel measure of non-Markovianity based on the distance between the quasi-exact dynamical map and the closest CP-divisible form and reveals that criticality leads to the closest Markovian representation at large times.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14133'&gt;arXiv:2507.14133&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 18 Jul 2025 17:58:48 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

The model is constructed by coupling $N\geq2$ golden anyon chains together, preserving $N$ copies of the Fibonacci non-invertible symmetry. We use the MPS/DMRG approach to study this model numerically, which allows us to calculate the corresponding conformal data, obtaining hints of its irrationality.

      <title>Quantum State Preparation Based on LimTDD</title>

With the rapid advancement of quantum technologies, efficient quantum state preparation has become increasingly important. This paper proposes a novel approach for quantum state preparation based on the Local Invertible Map Tensor Decision Diagram (LimTDD). LimTDD combines the advantages of tensor networks and decision diagrams, enabling efficient representation and manipulation of quantum states. Compared with the state-of-the-art quantum state preparation method, LimTDD demonstrates substantial improvements in efficiency when dealing with complex quantum states, while also reducing the complexity of quantum circuits. Examples indicate that, in the best-case scenario, our method can achieve exponential efficiency gains over existing methods. This study not only highlights the potential of LimTDD in quantum state preparation but also provides a robust theoretical and practical foundation for the future development of quantum computing technologies.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14496'&gt;arXiv:2507.14496&lt;/a&gt;] Published Sat, 19 Jul 2025 06:00:27 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Reconciling Translational Invariance and Hierarchy</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14656</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Olai B. Mykland, Zhao Zhang&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Tensor networks are not only numerical tools for describing ground states of quantum many-body systems, but also conceptual aids for understanding their entanglement structures. The proper way to understand tensor networks themselves is through explicit examples of solvable ground states that they describe exactly. In fact, this has historically been how tensor networks for gapped ground states, such as the matrix product state (MPS) and the projected entangled paired state, emerged as an elegant analytical framework from numerical techniques like the density matrix renormalization group. However, for gapless ground states, generically described by the multiscale entanglement renormalization ansatz (MERA), a corresponding exactly solvable model has so far been missing. This is because the hierarchical structure of MERA intrinsically breaks the translational invariance. We identify a condition for MERA to be compatible with translational invariance by examining equivalent networks of rank-3 tensors. The condition is satisfied by the previously constructed hierarchical tensor network for the Motzkin and Fredkin chains, which can be considered a non-unitary generalization to the MERA. The hierarchical TN description is complemented by a translationally invariant MPS alternative, which is used to derive the power-law decay of the correlation function and critical exponents.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14656'&gt;arXiv:2507.14656&lt;/a&gt;] Published Sat, 19 Jul 2025 15:06:14 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Rec-AD: An Efficient Computation Framework for FDIA Detection Based on Tensor Train Decomposition and Deep Learning Recommendation Model</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14668</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Yunfeng Li, Junhong Liu, Zhaohui Yang, Guofu Liao, Chuyun Zhang&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Deep learning models have been widely adopted for False Data Injection Attack (FDIA) detection in smart grids due to their ability to capture unstructured and sparse features. However, the increasing system scale and data dimensionality introduce significant computational and memory burdens, particularly in large-scale industrial datasets, limiting detection efficiency. To address these issues, this paper proposes Rec-AD, a computationally efficient framework that integrates Tensor Train decomposition with the Deep Learning Recommendation Model (DLRM). Rec-AD enhances training and inference efficiency through embedding compression, optimized data access via index reordering, and a pipeline training mechanism that reduces memory communication overhead. Fully compatible with PyTorch, Rec-AD can be integrated into existing FDIA detection systems without code modifications. Experimental results show that Rec-AD significantly improves computational throughput and real-time detection performance, narrowing the attack window and increasing attacker cost. These advancements strengthen edge computing capabilities and scalability, providing robust technical support for smart grid security.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14668'&gt;arXiv:2507.14668&lt;/a&gt;] Published Sat, 19 Jul 2025 15:38:56 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Spiral renormalization group flow and universal entanglement spectrum of the non-Hermitian 5-state Potts model</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14732</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Vic Vander Linden, Boris De Vos, Kevin Vervoort, Frank Verstraete, Atsushi Ueda&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The quantum $5$-state Potts model is known to possess a perturbative description using complex conformal field theory (CCFT), the analytic continuation of ``theory space" to a complex plane. To study the corresponding complex fixed point on the lattice, the model must be deformed by an additional non-Hermitian term due to its complex coefficient $\lambda$. Although the variational principle breaks down in this case, we demonstrate that tensor network algorithms are still capable of simulating these non-Hermitian theories. We access system sizes up to $L = 28$, which enable the observation of the theoretically predicted spiral flow of the running couplings. Moreover, we reconstruct the full boundary CCFT spectrum through the entanglement Hamiltonian encoded in the ground state. Our work demonstrates how tensor networks are the correct approach to capturing the approximate conformal invariance of weakly first-order phase transitions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14732'&gt;arXiv:2507.14732&lt;/a&gt;] Published Sat, 19 Jul 2025 19:46:16 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Planted Solutions in Quantum Chemistry: Generating Non-Trivial Hamiltonians with Known Ground States</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Linjun Wang, Joshua T. Cantin, Smik Patel, Ignacio Loaiza, Rick Huang, Artur F. Izmaylov&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Generating large, non-trivial quantum chemistry test problems with known ground-state solutions remains a core challenge for benchmarking electronic structure methods. Inspired by planted-solution techniques from combinatorial optimization, we introduce four classes of Hamiltonians with embedded, retrievable ground states. These Hamiltonians mimic realistic electronic structure problems, support adjustable complexity, and are derived from reference systems. Crucially, their ground-state energies can be computed exactly, provided the construction parameters are known. To obscure this structure and control perceived complexity, we introduce techniques such as killer operators, balance operators, and random orbital rotations. We showcase this framework using examples based on homogeneous catalysts of industrial relevance and validate tunable difficulty through density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) convergence behavior. Beyond enabling scalable, ground-truth benchmark generation, our approach offers a controlled setting to explore the limitations of electronic structure methods and investigate how Hamiltonian structure influences ground state solution difficulty.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15166'&gt;arXiv:2507.15166&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 21 Jul 2025 00:56:59 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Multipartite Markov Gaps and Entanglement Wedge Multiway Cuts</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15262</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Norihiro Iizuka, Akihiro Miyata, Mitsuhiro Nishida&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The Markov gap, defined as the difference between reflected entropy and mutual information, serves as a diagnostic for quantum recoverability and multipartite entanglement. In holographic settings, it admits a geometric interpretation as the deviation between entanglement wedge cross-sections and RT surfaces. Motivated by this holographic perspective, we propose a generalization of the Markov gap to multipartite systems by using a reflected multi-entropy. The resulting Multipartite Markov gap can capture geometric obstructions to bulk reconstruction. We investigate the properties of this quantity from both information-theoretic and holographic viewpoints, and examine its potential operational significance through candidate recovery maps. We further introduce the genuine reflected multi-entropy, which is designed to vanish for states containing only lower-partite entanglement. Together, these quantities offer complementary probes of recoverability and multipartite structure in holographic quantum systems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15262'&gt;arXiv:2507.15262&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 21 Jul 2025 05:57:18 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>One-point functions in AdS/dCFT: MPS and twisted Yangian</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15462</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Xin Qian&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; I focus on the scalar one-point functions in SO(6) sector of D5-D3 probe-brane set-up. Start with a general introduction of integrability, I explore both coordinate Bethe ansatz and algebraic Bethe ansatz, with possible generalization. I then shortly review how to use the Bethe ansatz in $N = 4$ super Yang-Mills theory, and then apply such procedure to the D5-D3 system. The dual field theory of such system corresponds to a defected version of $N = 4$ super Yang-Mills theory, where the one-point functions of certain scalars are non-zero. The calculation of one-point functions is mapped to the overlap between matrix product states and Bethe states. The matrix product states are found to be solutions of the twisted Boundary Yang-Baxter equation, and equivalently the representations of extended twisted Yangian. By dressing procedure or coproduct property, we can connect the scalar matrix product state and higher dimension matrix product states. We have used the branching rules to find the connection with some detailed parameters needed to be fixed. Such method can not only be used for calculations of one-point functions in probe-branes system, but also shed some light on non-equilibrium system.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15462'&gt;arXiv:2507.15462&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 21 Jul 2025 10:16:47 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Interaction-induced nematic Dirac semimetal from quadratic band touching: A constrained-path quantum Monte Carlo study</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15668</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Zi Hong Liu, Hongyu Lu, Zi Yang Meng, Lukas Janssen&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Electronic systems with quadratic band touchings, commonly found in two- and three-dimensional materials such as Bernal-stacked bilayer graphene, kagome metals, HgTe, and pyrochlore iridates, have attracted significant interest concerning the role of interactions in shaping their electronic properties. However, even in the simplest model of spinless fermions on a two-dimensional checkerboard lattice, the quantum phase diagram as a function of nearest-neighbor interaction remains under debate. We employ constrained-path quantum Monte Carlo simulations (CP-QMC) simulations to investigate the problem using a two-dimensional torus geometry. We cross-validate our results on small lattices by comparing them with density-matrix renormalization group calculations, finding quantitative agreement. In particular, we implement an improved optimization scheme within the CP-QMC simulations, enabling the identification of a bond-nematic Dirac semimetal phase that was found in tensor-network studies on cylindrical geometries, but remains inaccessible to Hartree-Fock mean-field methods. The CP-QMC approach makes it possible to establish the emergence of this phase in a geometry that preserves lattice rotational symmetry and permits extrapolation to the thermodynamic limit. Our results show that the quantum phase diagram of spinless fermions on the checkerboard lattice with nearest-neighbor repulsion features three interaction-induced phases at half filling: a quantum anomalous Hall insulator at weak coupling, a bond-nematic Dirac semimetal at intermediate coupling, and a site-nematic insulator at strong coupling.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15668'&gt;arXiv:2507.15668&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 21 Jul 2025 14:33:00 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Impact of finite squeezing on near-term quantum computations using GKP qubits</title>

Zinner&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We present the first detailed simulation of a measurement based quantum computation based on Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) qubits within a quad-rail lattice (QRL) cluster state involving over 100 GKP modes. This was enabled by the recently developed functional matrix product states (FMPS) framework, with which we simulate continuous-variable (CV) quantum circuits while explicitly modelling intrinsic coherent error sources due to finite squeezing. We perform simulated randomised benchmarking across squeezing levels between 5 and 15 dB and find strong agreement with analytical estimates for high quality GKP qubits. As a demonstration of practical computation, we simulate a three-qubit Grover's algorithm within the QRL and identify a fundamental squeezing threshold -- approximately 10 dB -- beyond which the algorithm outperforms classical probability bounds.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15955'&gt;arXiv:2507.15955&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 21 Jul 2025 18:00:10 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Beyond Fragmented Dopant Dynamics in Quantum Spin Lattices: Robust Localization and Sub-diffusion</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16042</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Mingru Yang, Sajant Anand, Kristian Knakkergaard Nielsen&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The motion of dopants in magnetic spin lattices has received tremendous attention for at least four decades due to its connection to high-temperature superconductivity. Despite these efforts, we lack a complete understanding of their behavior, especially out-of-equilibrium and at nonzero temperatures. In this Article, we take a significant step towards a much deeper understanding based on state-of-the-art matrix-product-state calculations. In particular, we investigate the non-equilibrium dynamics of a dopant in two-leg $t$-$J$ ladders with antiferromagnetic XXZ spin interactions. In the Ising limit, we find that the dopant is localized for all investigated nonzero temperatures due to an emergent disordered potential, with a localization length controlled by the underlying correlation length of the spin lattice, whereby it only delocalizes asymptotically in the zero temperature limit. This greatly generalizes the localization effect discovered recently in Hilbert space fragmented models. In the presence of spin-exchange processes, the dopant delocalizes according to a power-law behavior, which is strongly sub-diffusive for weak spin-exchange but which eventually becomes diffusive for strong enough exchange. Moreover, we show that the underlying spin dynamics at infinite temperature behaves qualitatively the same, albeit with important quantitative differences. We substantiate these findings by showing that the dynamics shows self-similar scaling behavior, which strongly deviates from the Gaussian behavior of regular diffusion. Finally, we show that the diffusion coefficient follows an Arrhenius relation at high temperatures, whereby it exponentially decreases for decreasing temperatures.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16042'&gt;arXiv:2507.16042&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 21 Jul 2025 20:18:21 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>"Odd" Toric Code in a tilted field: Higgs-confinement multicriticality, spontaneous self-duality symmetry breaking, and valence bond solids</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16523</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Umberto Borla, Ayush De, Snir Gazit&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We investigate the quantum phase diagram of an ``odd'' variant of the two-dimensional Ising Fradkin--Shenker model, characterized by a uniform background of static $e$ and $m$ charges. Using large-scale tensor network and exact diagonalization methods, we determine the topology of the phase diagram, identifying an ``odd'' deconfined phase, confinement- and Higgs-induced valence bond solids (VBS), and a trivial paramagnet. Most notably, we uncover an exotic multicritical point along the self-dual line, where electric and magnetic excitations are related by an enriched $\mathbb{Z}_2$ duality. This transition is marked by the simultaneous onset of confinement, Higgs condensation, translational symmetry breaking, and spontaneous duality symmetry breaking. Within our numerical accuracy, the transition appears continuous, involving the softening of excitation gaps for $e$ and $m$ anyons at finite momentum. At intermediate couplings, we further identify VBS phases with enlarged unit cells, potentially indicating frustration-induced crystalline order beyond commensurate limits.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16523'&gt;arXiv:2507.16523&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 22 Jul 2025 12:31:47 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Thermal Hall transport in Kitaev spin liquids</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16558</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Tsuyoshi Okubo, Joji Nasu, Takahiro Misawa, Yukitoshi Motome&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We investigate the thermal Hall conductivity in the Kitaev model with additional interactions under a magnetic field, employing a finite-temperature tensor network method benchmarked by a thermal pure quantum state technique. We find that the thermal Hall conductivity divided by temperature, $\kappa_{xy}/T$, significantly overshoots the value of the half-integer quantization and exhibits a pronounced hump while decreasing temperature. Moreover, we show that the field-direction dependence of $\kappa_{xy}/T$ is consistent with the sign of the Chern number associated with the Majorana fermions across a wide range of magnetic fields. We also demonstrate that the additional off-diagonal interactions, known as the $\Gamma$ and $\Gamma^{\prime}$ terms, considerably affect $\kappa_{xy}/T$. In particular, we show that positive $\Gamma$ and negative $\Gamma^{\prime}$ lead to a remarkable enhancement in the intermediate temperature region. From the comparison with the classical counterpart, we reveal that the effects of the $\Gamma$ term go beyond the classical picture, indicating significant quantum fluctuation effects, while those of the $\Gamma^\prime$ term are well captured at the classical level. These comprehensive analyses indicate that the enhanced thermal Hall response is consistently explained by dominant contributions from topological Majorana fermions, even within the polarized regime beyond the critical field. Our approach not only establishes a robust theoretical framework for understanding the thermal Hall transport in Kitaev materials such as $\alpha$-RuCl$_{3}$, but also offers a promising pathway to bridge the gap between theories and experiments across a wide range of strongly correlated materials.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16558'&gt;arXiv:2507.16558&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 22 Jul 2025 13:10:23 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Advancing Quantum State Preparation Using Decision Diagram with Local Invertible Maps</title>

It is critical to the execution of many quantum algorithms, including those in quantum machine learning. In this paper, we propose a family of efficient QSP algorithms tailored to different numbers of available ancilla qubits - ranging from no ancilla qubits, to a single ancilla qubit, to a sufficiently large number of ancilla qubits. Our approach exploits the power of Local Invertible Map Tensor Decision Diagrams (LimTDDs) - a highly compact representation of quantum states that combines tensor networks and decision diagrams to reduce quantum circuit complexity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our methods significantly outperform existing approaches and exhibit better scalability for large-scale quantum states, both in terms of runtime and gate complexity. Furthermore, our method shows exponential improvement in best-case scenarios.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17170'&gt;arXiv:2507.17170&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 23 Jul 2025 03:34:44 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Instability of explicit time integration for strongly quenched dynamics with neural quantum states</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Hrvoje Vrcan, Johan H. Mentink&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Neural quantum states have recently demonstrated significant potential for simulating quantum dynamics beyond the capabilities of existing variational ans\"atze. However, studying strongly driven quantum dynamics with neural networks has proven challenging so far. Here, we focus on assessing several sources of numerical instabilities that can appear in the simulation of quantum dynamics based on the time-dependent variational principle (TDVP) with the computationally efficient explicit time integration scheme. Using the restricted Boltzmann machine architecture, we compare solutions obtained by TDVP with analytical solutions and implicit methods as a function of the quench strength. Interestingly, we uncover a quenching strength that leads to a numerical breakdown in the absence of Monte Carlo noise, despite the fact that physical observables don't exhibit irregularities. This breakdown phenomenon appears consistently across several different TDVP formulations, even those that eliminate small eigenvalues of the Fisher matrix or use geometric properties to recast the equation of motion. We conclude that alternative methods need to be developed to leverage the computational efficiency of explicit time integration of the TDVP equations for simulating strongly nonequilibrium quantum dynamics with neural-network quantum states.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17421'&gt;arXiv:2507.17421&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 23 Jul 2025 11:25:19 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

To bridge this gap, we propose Tensor Volumetric Operator (TenVOO), a novel PEFT method specifically designed for fine-tuning DDPMs with 3D convolutional backbones. Leveraging tensor network modeling, TenVOO represents 3D convolution kernels with lower-dimensional tensors, effectively capturing complex spatial dependencies during fine-tuning with few parameters. We evaluate TenVOO on three downstream brain MRI datasets-ADNI, PPMI, and BraTS2021-by fine-tuning a DDPM pretrained on 59,830 T1-weighted brain MRI scans from the UK Biobank. Our results demonstrate that TenVOO achieves state-of-the-art performance in multi-scale structural similarity index measure (MS-SSIM), outperforming existing approaches in capturing spatial dependencies while requiring only 0.3% of the trainable parameters of the original model.

      <title>Surface growth scheme for bulk reconstruction and $T\bar T$ deformation</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Hao-Chun Liang, Jia-Rui Sun, Yuan Sun&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; In this paper, we study the dynamical connection between the surface growth scheme and the conformal field theory with $T\bar{T}$ deformation. By utilizing the extended one-shot entanglement distillation tensor network, we find that the iterative growth, i.e. radial evolution of homogenous and isotropic bulk minimal surfaces in asymptotically anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetime can be mapped to the $T\bar{T}$ operator flow driven by the deformation parameter. Our results show that the $T\bar{T}$ deformation can provide a dynamical mechanism for the surface growth in asymptotically AdS spacetime, which may shed light on reconstructing bulk gravitational dynamics from the surface growth scheme.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18435'&gt;arXiv:2507.18435&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 24 Jul 2025 14:15:53 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Entanglement across scales: Quantics tensor trains as a natural framework for renormalization</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19069</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Stefan Rohshap, Jheng-Wei Li, Alena Lorenz, Serap Hasil, Karsten Held, Anna Kauch, Markus Wallerberger&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Understanding entanglement remains one of the most intriguing problems in physics. While particle and site entanglement have been studied extensively, the investigation of length or energy scale entanglement, quantifying the information exchange between different length scales, has received far less attention. Here, we identify the quantics tensor train (QTT) technique, a matrix product state-inspired approach for overcoming computational bottlenecks in resource-intensive numerical calculations, as a renormalization group method by analytically expressing an exact cyclic reduction-based real-space renormalization scheme in QTT language, which serves as a natural formalism for the method. In doing so, we precisely match the QTT bond dimension, a measure of length scale entanglement, to the number of rescaled couplings generated in each coarse-graining renormalization step. While QTTs have so far been applied almost exclusively to numerical problems in physics, our analytical calculations demonstrate that they are also powerful tools for mitigating computational costs in semi-analytical treatments. We present our results for the one-dimensional tight-binding model with n-th-nearest-neighbor hopping, where the 2n rescaled couplings generated in the renormalization procedure precisely match the QTT bond dimension of the one-particle Green's function.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19069'&gt;arXiv:2507.19069&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 25 Jul 2025 08:32:25 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Barren-plateau free variational quantum simulation of Z2 lattice gauge theories</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19203</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Fariha Azad, Matteo Inajetovic, Stefan Kühn, Anna Pappa&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; In this work, we design a variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) suitable for investigating ground states and static string breaking in a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theory (LGT). We consider a two-leg ladder lattice coupled to Kogut-Susskind staggered fermions and verify the results of the VQE simulations using tensor network methods. We find that for varying Hamiltonian parameter regimes and in the presence of external charges, the VQE is able to arrive at the gauge-invariant ground state without explicitly enforcing gauge invariance through penalty terms. Additionally, experiments showing string breaking are performed on IBM's quantum platform. Thus, VQEs are seen to be a promising tool for $\mathbb{Z}_2$ LGTs, and could pave the way for studies of other gauge groups. We find that the scaling of gradients with the number of qubits is favorable for avoiding barren plateaus. At the same time, it is not clear how to efficiently simulate the LGT using classical methods. Furthermore, strategies that avoid barren plateaus arise naturally as features of LGTs, such as choosing the initialization by setting the Gauss law sector and restricting the Hilbert space to the gauge-invariant subspace.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19203'&gt;arXiv:2507.19203&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 25 Jul 2025 12:16:02 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Hybrid tensor network and neural network quantum states for quantum chemistry</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19276</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Zibo Wu, Bohan Zhang, Wei-Hai Fang, Zhendong Li&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Neural network quantum states (NQS) have emerged as a powerful and flexible framework for addressing quantum many-body problems. While successful for model Hamiltonians, their application to molecular systems remains challenging for several reasons. In this work, we introduce three innovations to overcome some of the key limitations. (1) We propose two novel ans\"atzet hat hybridize tensor network and neural network states for addressing initialization challenges and enhancing the expressivity of tensor networks. First, we develop a bounded-degree graph recurrent neural network (BDG-RNN) ansatz that leverages graph-based updates, enabling applications to molecular electronic structure problems. Second, we introduce restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) inspired correlators to further enhance expressivity and improve accuracy, without dramatically modifying the underlying variational Monte Carlo (VMC) optimization framework. (2) We introduce a semi-stochastic algorithm for local energy evaluation, which significantly reduces computational cost while maintaining high accuracy. Combining these advances, we demonstrate that our approaches can achieve chemical accuracy in challenging systems, including the one-dimensional hydrogen chain H50, the iron-sulfur cluster [Fe2S2(SCH3)4]^{2-}, and a three-dimensional $3 \times 3 \times 2$ hydrogen cluster H18. These methods are implemented in an open-source package - PyNQS (https://github.com/Quantum-Chemistry-Group-BNU/PyNQS) to advance NQS methodologies for quantum chemistry.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19276'&gt;arXiv:2507.19276&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 25 Jul 2025 13:55:34 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

Murillo&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Many-body correlations in strongly coupled liquids and plasmas are critical for many applications in nanofluids, biology, and fusion-related plasma physics, but their description in fully heterogeneous environments remains challenging due to the high-dimensional equations involved. Recently, tensor network decompositions have emerged as powerful tools for tackling such equations by reducing memory usage and computational complexity. In this paper, we solve for equilibrium density and density-density correlation functions of liquids in confined heterogeneous environments using tensor network methods. We demonstrate that these functions admit high compression when their lengthscale dependence is encoded via quantized tensor trains or when their spatial-coordinate dependence is represented in standard tensor-train format, but not with respect to their dependence on distinct particle coordinates.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19352'&gt;arXiv:2507.19352&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 25 Jul 2025 15:02:14 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>From weakly interacting spinons to tightly bound triplons in the frustrated quantum spin-Peierls chain</title>

Halász, Andrew D. Christianson&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Fractionalized quasiparticles and their confinement into emergent bound states lie at the heart of modern quantum magnetism. While the evolution into magnonic bound states has been well characterized, experimental insight into the analogous transition to triplons remains limited. Here, using high-resolution neutron spectroscopy and state-of-the-art spin dynamics simulations, we uncover the transformation from weakly interacting spinons to tightly bound triplons in the spin-Peierls compound CuGeO3. Quantitative comparisons between the measured spectra and tensor network simulations reveal substantial next-nearest-neighbor frustration and weak external dimerization, placing the system deep within the spontaneously dimerized regime and near the exactly solvable Majumdar-Ghosh point. We further show an energy- and temperature-dependent evolution between two contrasting quasiparticle regimes: deconfined spinons with markedly suppressed interactions by frustration, and coherent triplonic bound states with no observable spinon degrees of freedom. Remarkably, triplon character persists into the two-particle regime, forming a structured two-triplon continuum with a spectral feature associated with a van Hove singularity at its lower boundary. These findings challenge the conventional view that robust triplons require strong external dimerization and demonstrate how the interplay between frustration and dimerization can reshape fractionalization and confinement.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19412'&gt;arXiv:2507.19412&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 25 Jul 2025 16:26:39 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Local Potential Functional Embedding Theory of Molecular Systems: Localized Orbital-Based Embedding from an Exact Density-Functional Perspective</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19591</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; W. Makhlouf, B. Senjean, E. Fromager&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Localized orbital-based quantum embedding, as originally formulated in the context of density matrix embedding theory (DMET), is revisited from the perspective of lattice density functional theory (DFT). An in-principle exact (in the sense of full configuration interaction) formulation of the theory, where the occupations of the localized orbitals play the role of the density, is derived for any (model or ab initio) electronic Hamiltonian. From this general formalism we deduce an exact relation between the local Hartree-exchange-correlation (Hxc) potential of the full-size Kohn-Sham (KS) lattice-like system and the embedding chemical potential that is adjusted on each embedded fragment, individually, such that both KS and embedding cluster systems reproduce the exact same local density. When well-identified density-functional approximations (that find their justification in the strongly correlated regime) are applied, a practical self-consistent local potential functional embedding theory (LPFET), where the local Hxc potential becomes the basic variable, naturally emerges from the theory. LPFET differs from previous density embedding approaches by its fragment-dependent embedding chemical potential expression, which is a simple functional of the Hxc potential. Numerical calculations on prototypical systems show the ability of such an ansatz to ease convergence and improve substantially the description of density profiles (localized orbital occupations in this context) in strongly correlated systems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19591'&gt;arXiv:2507.19591&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 25 Jul 2025 18:05:09 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Ken Shiozaki&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We analyze topological phase transitions and higher Berry curvature in one-dimensional quantum spin systems, using a framework that explicitly incorporates the symmetry group action on the parameter space. Based on a $G$-compatible discretization of the parameter space, we incorporate both group cochains and parameter-space differentials, enabling the systematic construction of equivariant topological invariants. We derive a fixed-point formula for the higher Berry invariant in the case where the symmetry action has isolated fixed points. This reveals that the phase transition point between Haldane and trivial phases acts as a monopole-like defect where higher Berry curvature emanates. We further discuss hierarchical structures of topological defects in the parameter space, governed by symmetry reductions and compatibility with subgroup structures.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19932'&gt;arXiv:2507.19932&lt;/a&gt;] Published Sat, 26 Jul 2025 12:36:55 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Anyonic Josephson junctions: Dynamical and ground-state properties</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Jessica John Britto&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Bosons with density-dependent hopping on a one dimensional lattice have been shown to emulate anyonic particles with fractional exchange statistics. Leveraging this, we construct a Josephson junction setup, where an insulating barrier in the form of a Mott-insulator is sandwiched between two superfluid phases. This is obtained by spatially varying either the statistical phase or the strength of the on-site interaction potential on which the ground state of the system depends. Utilizing numerical methods such as exact diagonalization and density renormalization group theory, the ground state properties of this setup are investigated to understand the Josephson effect in a strongly correlated regime. The dynamical properties of this model for different configurations of this model are analyzed to find the configurations that can produce the Josephson effect. Furthermore, it is observed that continuous particle flow over time is achievable in this proposed model solely by creating an initial phase difference without any external biasing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20044'&gt;arXiv:2507.20044&lt;/a&gt;] Published Sat, 26 Jul 2025 19:33:22 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

We analyze quench dynamics of observable quantities, the quantum geometric tensor, and various entanglement quantities, including the entanglement entropy, the SVD entropy, and the Tu-Tzeng-Chang entropy. Our results show that a sudden quench into a PT-broken phase generally leads to exponential growth in these quantities, driven by the biorthogonal density matrix's non-positivity. In contrast to generic interacting systems, we observe a surprising linear decay in the TTC entropy for non-interacting fermionic systems. This finding originates from the approximate spectral symmetry of the biorthogonal reduced density matrix, and we confirm our findings using the Yang-Lee and non-Hermitian XXZ models.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20155'&gt;arXiv:2507.20155&lt;/a&gt;] Published Sun, 27 Jul 2025 07:20:14 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Neural Importance Resampling: A Practical Sampling Strategy for Neural Quantum States</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20510</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Eimantas Ledinauskas, Egidijus Anisimovas&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Neural quantum states (NQS) have emerged as powerful tools for simulating many-body quantum systems, but their practical use is often hindered by limitations of current sampling techniques. Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods suffer from slow mixing and require manual tuning, while autoregressive NQS impose restrictive architectural constraints that complicate the enforcement of symmetries and the construction of determinant-based multi-state wave functions. In this work, we introduce Neural Importance Resampling (NIR), a new sampling algorithm that combines importance resampling with a separately trained autoregressive proposal network. This approach enables efficient and unbiased sampling without constraining the NQS architecture. We demonstrate that NIR supports stable and scalable training, including for multi-state NQS, and mitigates issues faced by MCMC and autoregressive approaches. Numerical experiments on the 2D transverse-field Ising model show that NIR outperforms MCMC in challenging regimes and yields results competitive with density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) methods. Our results establish NIR as a robust alternative for sampling in variational NQS algorithms.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20510'&gt;arXiv:2507.20510&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 28 Jul 2025 04:16:17 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Optimizing Tensor Network Partitioning using Simulated Annealing</title>

Mendl&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Tensor networks have proven to be a valuable tool, for instance, in the classical simulation of (strongly correlated) quantum systems. As the size of the systems increases, contracting larger tensor networks becomes computationally demanding. In this work, we study distributed memory architectures intended for high-performance computing implementations to solve this task. Efficiently distributing the contraction task across multiple nodes is critical, as both computational and memory costs are highly sensitive to the chosen partitioning strategy. While prior work has employed general-purpose hypergraph partitioning algorithms, these approaches often overlook the specific structure and cost characteristics of tensor network contractions. We introduce a simulated annealing-based method that iteratively refines the partitioning to minimize the total operation count, thereby reducing time-to-solution.

      <title>Optimizing adsorption configurations on alloy surfaces using Tensor Train Optimizer</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20827</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Tuan Minh Do, Tomoya Shiota, Wataru Mizukami&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Understanding how molecules arrange on surfaces is fundamental to surface chemistry and essential for the rational design of catalytic and functional materials. In particular, the energetically most stable configuration provides valuable insight into adsorption-related processes. However, the search for this configuration is a global optimization problem with exponentially growing complexity as the number of adsorbates and possible adsorption sites increases. To address this, we express the adsorption energy as a sum of multi-adsorbate interaction terms, evaluated using our in-house trained machine learning interatomic potential MACE-Osaka24, and formulate the search for the most stable configuration as a higher-order unconstrained binary optimization (HUBO) problem. We employ a tensor-train-based method, Tensor Train Optimizer (TTOpt), to solve the HUBO problem and identify optimal adsorption configurations of CO and NO molecules on various alloys up to full surface coverage. Our results show that including interaction terms up to third order may be sufficient to approximate adsorption energies within chemical accuracy and to identify optimal configurations. We also observed that TTOpt performs better with the HUBO formulation, suggesting that third-order terms help preserve correlations between adsorption sites, which allow TTOpt to optimize configurations more effectively. The extensive benchmarks across various alloys, surface geometries, and adsorbates demonstrate the robustness and applicability of using TTOpt to solve HUBO-type global optimization problems in surface chemistry. In contrast to quantum and digital annealers, which have recently been applied to similar global optimization tasks but are restricted to cost functions with at most quadratic terms, our approach can incorporate higher-order terms in a straightforward manner and does not require specialized hardware.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20827'&gt;arXiv:2507.20827&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 28 Jul 2025 13:33:05 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Emergence of a Boundary-Sensitive Phase in Hyperbolic Ising Models</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21044</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Xingzhi Wang, Zohar Nussinov, Gerardo Ortiz&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Physical systems defined on hyperbolic lattices may exhibit phases of matter that only emerge due to negative curvature. We focus on the case of the Ising model under open boundary conditions and show that an ``intermediate'' phase emerges in addition to standard (high-temperature) paramagnetic and (low-temperature) ferromagnetic phases. When performing the Kramers-Wannier duality the fact that it alters boundary conditions becomes crucial, since a finite fraction of lattice sites lie on the boundary. We propose to characterize this ``intermediate'' phase by its sensitivity to boundary conditions, wherein bulk ordering is not spontaneous but rather induced by boundary effects, setting it apart from the Landau paradigm of spontaneous symmetry breaking. By developing a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry restricted extension of the Corner Transfer Matrix Renormalization Group method, we provide numerical evidence for the existence of all three distinct phases and their corresponding two-stage phase transitions, thereby establishing the complete phase diagram. We also establish how the (spontaneous) intermediate-to-ferromagnetic and the (induced) paramagnetic-to-intermediate transition points are related by the Kramers-Wannier duality relation. We discuss a holographic correspondence between boundary and bulk behaviors and derive exact expressions for boundary correlation functions on Cayley trees.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21044'&gt;arXiv:2507.21044&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 28 Jul 2025 17:59:02 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Static and Dynamical Characterization of Ground State Phases Induced by Frustration and Magnetic Field in the Spin-1 Orthogonal Dimer Chain</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21771</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Ernest Ong, Dhiman Bhowmick, Sharoz Schezwen, Pinaki Sengupta&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The spin-$1$ orthogonal dimer chain is investigated using the Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) algorithm. A transformation to a basis that uses the local eigenstates of the orthogonal dimers, while retaining the local spin states for the parallel spins, allows for more effective implementation of the symmetries, as well as mitigating the entanglement bias of DMRG. A rich ground state phase diagram is obtained in the parameter space spanned by the ratio of inter- to intra-dimer interaction (which measures the degree of frustration) and an external magnetic field. Some ground state phases exhibit effective Haldane chain character, whereas others exhibit fragmentation of the ground state wavefunction, or clustering. The phases are characterized by their static properties, including (local) spin quantum number, entanglement entropy, and the spin-spin correlation function. Detailed characterization of a carefully selected set of representative states is presented. The static properties are complemented by exploring the low-energy dynamics through the calculation of the dynamic structure factor. The results provide crucial insight into the emergence of complex ground state phases from the interplay between strong interactions, geometric frustration, and external magnetic field for interacting S=1 Heisenberg spins.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21771'&gt;arXiv:2507.21771&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 29 Jul 2025 12:55:55 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>The Augmented Tree Tensor Network Cookbook</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Nora Reinić, Luka Pavešić, Daniel Jaschke, Simone Montangero&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; An augmented tree tensor network (aTTN) is a tensor network ansatz constructed by applying a layer of unitary disentanglers to a tree tensor network. The disentanglers absorb a part of the system's entanglement. This makes aTTNs suitable for simulating higher-dimensional lattices, where the entanglement increases with the lattice size even for states that obey the area law. These lecture notes serve as a detailed guide for implementing the aTTN algorithms. We present a variational algorithm for ground state search and discuss the measurement of observables, and offer an open-source implementation within the Quantum TEA library. We benchmark the performance of the ground state search for different parameters and hyperparameters in the square lattice quantum Ising model and the triangular lattice Heisenberg model for up to $32 \times 32$ spins. The benchmarks identify the regimes where the aTTNs offer advantages in accuracy relative to computational cost compared to matrix product states and tree tensor networks.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21236'&gt;arXiv:2507.21236&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 28 Jul 2025 18:00:39 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Variational inference and density estimation with non-negative tensor train</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21519</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Xun Tang, Rajat Dwaraknath, Lexing Ying&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; This work proposes an efficient numerical approach for compressing a high-dimensional discrete distribution function into a non-negative tensor train (NTT) format. The two settings we consider are variational inference and density estimation, whereby one has access to either the unnormalized analytic formula of the distribution or the samples generated from the distribution. In particular, the compression is done through a two-stage approach. In the first stage, we use existing subroutines to encode the distribution function in a tensor train format. In the second stage, we use an NTT ansatz to fit the obtained tensor train. For the NTT fitting procedure, we use a log barrier term to ensure the positivity of each tensor component, and then utilize a second-order alternating minimization scheme to accelerate convergence. In practice, we observe that the proposed NTT fitting procedure exhibits drastically faster convergence than an alternative multiplicative update method that has been previously proposed. Through challenging numerical experiments, we show that our approach can accurately compress target distribution functions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21519'&gt;arXiv:2507.21519&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 29 Jul 2025 05:59:44 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Triad Representation for the Anisotropic Tensor Renormalization Group in Four Dimensions</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Yuto Sugimoto, Shoichi Sasaki&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The development of tensor renormalization group (TRG) algorithm in higher dimensions is an important and urgent task, as the TRG is expected to provide a way to overcome the sign problem in lattice QCD calculations at finite density. One possible approach that enables faster computations in four-dimensional lattice theories is the anisotropic tensor renormalization group (ATRG). However, the computational cost remains substantial and requires significant computational resources. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm, called the Triad-ATRG, which is based on the ATRG and other improved TRG variants with triad network representation. This method achieves lower scaling with respect to the bond dimension, while minimizing the loss of accuracy in the free energy and other physical quantities. We also present parallel implementations of both the ATRG and Triad-ATRG on multiple GPUs, which significantly improve performance compared to CPU-based calculations for the four-dimensional system.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21909'&gt;arXiv:2507.21909&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 29 Jul 2025 15:24:17 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Quantum generative modeling for financial time series with temporal correlations</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22035</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; David Dechant, Eliot Schwander, Lucas van Drooge, Charles Moussa, Diego Garlaschelli, Vedran Dunjko, Jordi Tura&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Quantum generative adversarial networks (QGANs) have been investigated as a method for generating synthetic data with the goal of augmenting training data sets for neural networks. This is especially relevant for financial time series, since we only ever observe one realization of the process, namely the historical evolution of the market, which is further limited by data availability and the age of the market. However, for classical generative adversarial networks it has been shown that generated data may (often) not exhibit desired properties (also called stylized facts), such as matching a certain distribution or showing specific temporal correlations. Here, we investigate whether quantum correlations in quantum inspired models of QGANs can help in the generation of financial time series. We train QGANs, composed of a quantum generator and a classical discriminator, and investigate two approaches for simulating the quantum generator: a full simulation of the quantum circuits, and an approximate simulation using tensor network methods. We tested how the choice of hyperparameters, such as the circuit depth and bond dimensions, influenced the quality of the generated time series. The QGAN that we trained generate synthetic financial time series that not only match the target distribution but also exhibit the desired temporal correlations, with the quality of each property depending on the hyperparameters and simulation method.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22035'&gt;arXiv:2507.22035&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 29 Jul 2025 17:36:49 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Supervised Quantum Image Processing</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Marco Parigi, Mehran Khosrojerdi, Filippo Caruso, Leonardo Banchi&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; In the era of big data and artificial intelligence, the increasing volume of data and the demand to solve more and more complex computational challenges are two driving forces for improving the efficiency of data storage, processing and analysis. Quantum image processing (QIP) is an interdisciplinary field between quantum information science and image processing, which has the potential to alleviate some of these challenges by leveraging the power of quantum computing. In this work, we compare and examine the compression properties of four different Quantum Image Representations (QImRs): namely, Tensor Network Representation (TNR), Flexible Representation of Quantum Image (FRQI), Novel Enhanced Quantum Representation NEQR, and Quantum Probability Image Encoding (QPIE). Our simulations show that FRQI performs a higher compression of image information than TNR, NEQR, and QPIE. Furthermore, we investigate the trade-off between accuracy and memory in binary classification problems, evaluating the performance of quantum kernels based on QImRs compared to the classical linear kernel. Our results indicate that quantum kernels provide comparable classification average accuracy but require exponentially fewer resources for image storage.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22039'&gt;arXiv:2507.22039&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 29 Jul 2025 17:40:59 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Phases of Interacting Fibonacci Anyons on a Ladder at Half-Filling</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Nico Kirchner, Roderich Moessner, Frank Pollmann, Adam Gammon-Smith&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Two-dimensional many-body quantum systems can exhibit topological order and support collective excitations with anyonic statistics different from the usual fermionic or bosonic ones. With the emergence of these exotic point-like particles, it is natural to ask what phases can arise in interacting many-anyon systems. To study this topic, we consider the particular case of Fibonacci anyons subject to an anyonic tight-binding model with nearest-neighbor repulsion on a two-leg ladder. Focusing on the case of half-filling, for low interaction strengths an ''anyonic'' metal is found, whereas for strong repulsion, the anyons form an insulating charge-density wave. Within the latter regime, we introduce an effective one-dimensional model up to sixth order in perturbation theory arising from anyonic superexchange processes. We numerically identify four distinct phases of the effective model, which we characterize using matrix product state methods. These include both the ferro- and antiferromagnetic golden chain, a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ phase, and an incommensurate phase.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22115'&gt;arXiv:2507.22115&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 29 Jul 2025 18:00:01 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

By performing a non-local unitary transformation, we explicitly construct a local fermionic Hamiltonian that exhibits two nontrivial topological phases separated by an extended Luttinger liquid regime. We demonstrate the topological nature of these phases by analyzing the entanglement structure, deriving a non-local string order parameter, and constructing an exact zero mode operator that connects states in different fermionic parity sectors.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22119'&gt;arXiv:2507.22119&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 29 Jul 2025 18:00:03 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Sequential Circuit as Generalized Symmetry on Lattice</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Nathanan Tantivasadakarn, Xinyu Liu, Xie Chen&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Generalized symmetry extends the usual notion of symmetry to ones that are of higher-form, acting on subsystems, non-invertible, etc. The concept was originally defined in the field theory context using the idea of topological defects. On the lattice, an immediate consequence is that a symmetry twist is moved across the system by a sequential quantum circuit. In this paper, we ask how to obtain the full, potentially non-invertible symmetry action from the unitary sequential circuit and how the connection to sequential circuit constrains the properties of the generalized symmetries. We find that for symmetries that contain the trivial symmetry operator as a fusion outcome, which we call annihilable symmetries, the sequential circuit fully determines the symmetry action and puts various constraints on their fusion. In contrast, for unannihilable symmetries, like that whose corresponding twist is the Cheshire string, a further 1D sequential circuit is needed for the full description. Matrix product operator and tensor network operator representations play an important role in our discussion.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22394'&gt;arXiv:2507.22394&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 30 Jul 2025 05:28:27 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; José Garre-Rubio, András Molnár, Germán Sierra&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We introduce a framework to define coalgebra and bialgebra structures on two-dimensional (2D) square lattices, extending the algebraic theory of Hopf algebras and quantum groups beyond the one-dimensional (1D) setting. Our construction is based on defining 2D coproducts through horizontal and vertical maps that satisfy compatibility and associativity conditions, enabling the consistent growth of vector spaces over lattice sites. We present several examples of 2D bialgebras, including group-like and Lie algebra-inspired constructions and a quasi-1D coproduct instance that is applicable to Taft-Hopf algebras and to quantum groups. The approach is further applied to the quantum group $U_q[su(2)]$, for which we construct 2D generalizations of its generators, analyze $q$-deformed singlet states, and derive a 2D R-matrix satisfying an intertwining relation in the semiclassical limit. Additionally, we show how tensor network states, particularly PEPS, naturally induce 2D coalgebra structures when supplemented with appropriate boundary conditions. Our results establish a local and algebraically consistent method to embed quantum group symmetries into higher-dimensional lattice systems, potentially connecting to the emerging theory of fusion 2-categories and categorical symmetries in quantum many-body physics.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22541'&gt;arXiv:2507.22541&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 30 Jul 2025 10:13:11 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Minimizing entanglement entropy for enhanced quantum state preparation</title>

The goal is to encode classical information directly to the quantum state so that it is possible to leverage quantum algorithms for data processing. However, quantum state preparation of arbitrary states scales exponentially in the number of two-qubit gates, and this makes quantum state preparation a very difficult task on quantum computers, especially on near-term noisy devices. This represents a major challenge in achieving quantum advantage. We present and analyze a novel two-step state preparation method where we first minimize the entanglement entropy of the target quantum state, thus transforming the state to one that is easier to prepare. The state with reduced entanglement entropy is then represented as a matrix product state, resulting in a high accuracy preparation of the target state. Our method is suitable for NISQ devices and we give rigorous lower bounds on the accuracy of the prepared state in terms of the entanglement entropy and demonstrate cutting-edge performance across a collection of benchmark states.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22562'&gt;arXiv:2507.22562&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 30 Jul 2025 10:37:07 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Adrián Franco-Rubio, J. Ignacio Cirac, Germán Sierra&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We introduce one-parameter families of spin chain ansatz wavefunctions constructed from chiral conformal field theory correlators on a torus, with the modular parameter $\tau$ serving as the deformation parameter. In the cylinder limit $\tau\to\infty$, these wavefunctions reduce to infinite dimensional matrix product states. In contrast, in the thin torus limit $\tau\to0$, they become finite bond dimension matrix product states (MPS). Focusing on families derived from the SU(2)$_1$ and SU(2)$_2$ Wess-Zumino-Witten models, we show that in the thin torus limit they reproduce known MPS ground states, such as those of the Majumdar-Ghosh and AKLT spin chains.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22735'&gt;arXiv:2507.22735&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 30 Jul 2025 14:56:02 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Field digitization scaling in a $\mathbb{Z}_N \subset U(1)$ symmetric model</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22984</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Gabriele Calliari, Robert Ott, Hannes Pichler, Torsten V. Zache&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The simulation of quantum field theories, both classical and quantum, requires regularization of infinitely many degrees of freedom. However, in the context of field digitization (FD) -- a truncation of the local fields to $N$ discrete values -- a comprehensive framework to obtain continuum results is currently missing. Here, we propose to analyze FD by interpreting the parameter $N$ as a coupling in the renormalization group (RG) sense. As a first example, we investigate the two-dimensional classical $N$-state clock model as a $\mathbb{Z}_N$ FD of the $U(1)$-symmetric $XY$-model. Using effective field theory, we employ the RG to derive generalized scaling hypotheses involving the FD parameter $N$, which allows us to relate data obtained for different $N$-regularized models in a procedure that we term $\textit{field digitization scaling}$ (FDS). Using numerical tensor-network calculations at finite bond dimension $\chi$, we further uncover an unconventional universal crossover around a low-temperature phase transition induced by finite $N$, demonstrating that FDS can be extended to describe the interplay of $\chi$ and $N$. Finally, we analytically prove that our calculations for the 2D classical-statistical $\mathbb{Z}_N$ clock model are directly related to the quantum physics in the ground state of a (2+1)D $\mathbb{Z}_N$ lattice gauge theory which serves as a FD of compact quantum electrodynamics. Our study thus paves the way for applications of FDS to quantum simulations of more complex models in higher spatial dimensions, where it could serve as a tool to analyze the continuum limit of digitized quantum field theories.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22984'&gt;arXiv:2507.22984&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 30 Jul 2025 18:00:02 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Tensor Network Representations for Intrinsically Mixed-State Topological Orders</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Bader Aldossari, Sergey Blinov, Zhu-Xi Luo&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Tensor networks are an efficient platform to represent interesting quantum states of matter as well as to compute physical observables and information-theoretic quantities. We present a general protocol to construct fixed-point tensor network representations for intrinsically mixed-state topological phases, which exhibit nontrivial topological phenomena and do not have pure-state counterparts. The method exploits the power of anyon condensation in Choi states and is applicable to the cases where the target states arise from pure-state topological phases subject to strong decoherence/disorders in the Abelian sectors. Representative examples include $m^a e^b$ decoherence of $\mathbb{Z}_N$ toric code, decohered non-Abelian $S_3$ quantum double as well as pure $Z$/$X$ decoherence of arbitrary CSS codes. An example of chiral topological phases which cannot arise from local commuting projector models are also presented.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22989'&gt;arXiv:2507.22989&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 30 Jul 2025 18:00:04 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>AC/DC spin current in ferromagnet/superconductor/normal metal trilayer systems</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23262</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Koki Mizuno, Hirone Ishida, Manato Teranishi&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Spin pumping with superconductors has been extensively studied, particularly in double-layer systems. In this study, we investigate spin pumping in a trilayer system comprising a ferromagnetic insulator (FMI), a superconductor (SC), and a normal metal (NM). We derive the AC and DC spin currents in the NM layer induced by spin motion in the FMI under circularly polarized microwave irradiation. If we treat the spin motion as classical, the AC spin current is expressed. On the other hand, if we treat the spin motion as quantum quasiparticles, the DC spin current is derived. After these derivations, while the computational cost of evaluating the spin current is extremely high, we mitigate this using the Quantics Tensor Cross Interpolation (QTCI) method. We present numerical results showing the dependence of the spin current on temperature, microwave frequency, and superconductor layer thickness. Notably, the temperature dependence of AC and DC spin currents exhibits a coherence peak. Furthermore, we have discovered a transition structure in the dependence of the spin current on the thickness of the superconductor layer, where the dependence changes after a particular frequency.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23262'&gt;arXiv:2507.23262&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 31 Jul 2025 05:52:57 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Transfer entropy and O-information to detect grokking in tensor network multi-class classification problems</title>

In this work, we study the training dynamics of Matrix Product State (MPS) classifiers applied to three-class problems, using both fashion MNIST and hyper-spectral satellite imagery as representative datasets. We investigate the phenomenon of grokking, where generalization emerges suddenly after memorization, by tracking entanglement entropy, local magnetization, and model performance across training sweeps. Additionally, we employ information theory tools to gain deeper insights: transfer entropy is used to reveal causal dependencies between label-specific quantum masks, while O-information captures the shift from synergistic to redundant correlations among class outputs. Our results show that grokking in the fashion MNIST task coincides with a sharp entanglement transition and a peak in redundant information, whereas the overfitted hyper-spectral model retains synergistic, disordered behavior. These findings highlight the relevance of high-order information dynamics in quantum-inspired learning and emphasize the distinct learning behaviors that emerge in multi-class classification, offering a principled framework to interpret generalization in quantum machine learning architectures.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23346'&gt;arXiv:2507.23346&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 31 Jul 2025 08:53:04 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Embedding-Aware Quantum-Classical SVMs for Scalable Quantum Machine Learning</title>

We propose an embedding-aware quantum-classical pipeline combining class-balanced k-means distillation with pretrained Vision Transformer embeddings. Our key finding: ViT embeddings uniquely enable quantum advantage, achieving up to 8.02% accuracy improvements over classical SVMs on Fashion-MNIST and 4.42% on MNIST, while CNN features show performance degradation. Using 16-qubit tensor network simulation via cuTensorNet, we provide the first systematic evidence that quantum kernel advantage depends critically on embedding choice, revealing fundamental synergy between transformer attention and quantum feature spaces. This provides a practical pathway for scalable quantum machine learning that leverages modern neural architectures.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00024'&gt;arXiv:2508.00024&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 28 Jul 2025 21:23:51 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Dimension reduction with structure-aware quantum circuits for hybrid machine learning</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00048</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Ammar Daskin&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Schmidt decomposition of a vector can be understood as writing the singular value decomposition (SVD) in vector form. A vector can be written as a linear combination of tensor product of two dimensional vectors by recursively applying Schmidt decompositions via SVD to all subsystems. Given a vector expressed as a linear combination of tensor products, using only the $k$ principal terms yields a $k$-rank approximation of the vector. Therefore, writing a vector in this reduced form allows to retain most important parts of the vector while removing small noises from it, analogous to SVD-based denoising. In this paper, we show that quantum circuits designed based on a value $k$ (determined from the tensor network decomposition of the mean vector of the training sample) can approximate the reduced-form representations of entire datasets. We then employ this circuit ansatz with a classical neural network head to construct a hybrid machine learning model. Since the output of the quantum circuit for an $2^n$ dimensional vector is an $n$ dimensional probability vector, this provides an exponential compression of the input and potentially can reduce the number of learnable parameters for training large-scale models. We use datasets provided in the Python scikit-learn module for the experiments. The results confirm the quantum circuit is able to compress data successfully to provide effective $k$-rank approximations to the classical processing component.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00048'&gt;arXiv:2508.00048&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 31 Jul 2025 17:18:43 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Free Independence and Unitary Design from Random Matrix Product Unitaries</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00051</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Neil Dowling, Jacopo De Nardis, Markus Heinrich, Xhek Turkeshi, Silvia Pappalardi&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The concept of unitary randomness underpins the modern theory of quantum chaos and fundamental tasks in quantum information. In one research direction, out-of-time-ordered correlators (OTOCs) have recently been shown to probe freeness between Heisenberg operators, the non-commutative generalization of statistical independence. In a distinct setting, approximate unitary designs look random according to small moments and for forward-in-time protocols. Bridging these two concepts, we study the emergence of freeness in a random matrix product unitary (RMPU) ensemble, an efficient unitary design. We prove that, with only polynomial bond dimension, these unitaries reproduce Haar values of higher-order OTOCs for local, finite-trace observables -- precisely those predicted to thermalize in chaotic many-body systems according to the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis. We further compute the frame potential of the RMPU ensemble, showing convergence to the Haar value also with only polynomial deviations, indicating that freeness is reached on-average for global observables. On the other hand, to reproduce freeness for traceless observables, volume-law operator entanglement is required. Our results highlight the need to refine previous notions of unitary design in the context of operator dynamics, guiding us towards protocols for quantum advantage while shedding light on the emergent complexity of chaotic many-body systems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00051'&gt;arXiv:2508.00051&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 31 Jul 2025 18:00:00 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Anyon superfluid in trilayer quantum Hall systems</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Taige Wang, Ya-Hui Zhang&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Intertwining intrinsic topological order with gapless collective modes remains a central challenge in many-body physics. We show that a quantum-Hall trilayer at $\nu_{1}=\nu_{2}=\nu_{3}= \frac13$, tuned solely by the inter-layer spacing $d$, realizes this goal. Large-scale density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) calculations and a Chern-Simons field theory analysis reveal an intermediate ``anyon-exciton condensate'' separating the familiar $\nu_{\mathrm{tot}}=1$ exciton condensate ($d \to 0$) from three decoupled Laughlin liquids ($d \to \infty$). In this phase, neutral bi-excitons condense while a $\nu=\frac23$ Laughlin topological order survives, yielding a Goldstone mode coexisting with fractionalized anyons. A Ginzburg-Landau analysis maps out the finite-temperature phase diagram. The anyon-exciton condensate can be experimentally verified through a vanishing double-counter-flow resistance and a fractional layer-resolved Hall resistivity $R_{xy}=\frac{5}{2} h/e^{2}$, both within reach of existing high-mobility trilayer devices.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00058'&gt;arXiv:2508.00058&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 31 Jul 2025 18:00:01 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Truncating loopy tensor networks by zero-mode gauge fixing</title>

We show that even local bond optimization can make better use of the insight it has locally into relevant loop correlations. By cutting the bond, we define a set of states whose linear dependence can be used to truncate the bond dimension. The linear dependence is eliminated with zero modes of the states' metric tensor. The method is illustrated by a series of examples for the infinite pair entangled projected state (iPEPS) and for the periodic matrix product state (pMPS) that occurs in the tensor renormalization group (TRG) step. In all examples, it provides better initial truncation errors than standard initialization.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00338'&gt;arXiv:2508.00338&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 01 Aug 2025 05:55:56 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

The proposed method is based on the MeLoCoToN approach, which addresses combinatorial optimization problems through classical tensor networks. The presented tensor network performs the multiplication of every pair of possible input numbers and selects those whose product is the number to be factorized. Additionally, in order to make the algorithm more efficient, the number and dimension of the tensors and their contraction scheme are optimized. Finally, a series of tests on the algorithm are conducted, contracting the tensor network both exactly and approximately using tensor train compression, and evaluating its performance.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00907'&gt;arXiv:2508.00907&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 29 Jul 2025 10:38:51 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Band mixing effects in one-dimensional charge transfer insulators</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Samuel Milner, Steven Johnston, Adrian Feiguin&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The low-energy properties of transition metal oxides (TMOs) are governed by the electrons occupying strongly correlated $d$-orbitals that are hybridized with surrounding ligand oxygen $p$ orbitals to varying degrees. Their physics is thus established by a complex interplay between the transition-metal (TM)-ligand hopping $t$, charge transfer energy $\Delta_\mathrm{CT}$, and on-site TM Hubbard repulsion $U$. Here, we study the spectral properties of a one-dimensional (1D) analog of such a $pd$ system, with alternating TM $d$ and ligand anion $p$ orbitals situated along a chain. Using the density matrix renormalization group method, we study the model's single-particle spectral function, x-ray absorption spectrum, and dynamical spin structure factor as a function of $\Delta_\mathrm{CT}$ and $U$. In particular, we present results spanning from the Mott insulating ($\Delta_\mathrm{CT} &gt; U$) to negative charge transfer regime $\Delta_\mathrm{CT} &lt; 0$ to better understand the ground and momentum-resolved excited state properties of these different regimes. Our results can guide new studies on TMOs that seek to situate them within the Mott-Hubbard/charge transfer insulator classification scheme.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01011'&gt;arXiv:2508.01011&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 01 Aug 2025 18:23:41 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Biorthogonal Neural Network Approach to Two-Dimensional Non-Hermitian Systems</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Massimo Solinas, Brandon Barton, Yuxuan Zhang, Jannes Nys, Juan Carrasquilla&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Non-Hermitian quantum many-body systems exhibit a rich array of physical phenomena, including non-Hermitian skin effects and exceptional points, that remain largely inaccessible to existing numerical techniques. In this work, we investigate the application of variational Monte Carlo and neural network wavefunction representations to examine their ground-state (the eigenstate with the smallest real part energy) properties. Due to the breakdown of the Rayleigh-Ritz variational principle in non-Hermitian settings, we develop a self-consistent symmetric optimization framework based on variance minimization with a dynamically updated energy estimate. Our approach respects the biorthogonal structure of left and right eigenstates, and is further strengthened by exploiting system symmetries and pseudo-Hermiticity. Tested on a two-dimensional non-Hermitian transverse field Ising model endowed with a complex longitudinal field, our method achieves high accuracy across both parity-time symmetric and broken phases. Moreover, we propose novel optimization routines that address the challenges posed by exceptional points and provide reliable convergence to the ground state in regimes where standard variational techniques fail. Lastly, we show, through extensive numerical evidence, that our method offers a scalable and flexible computational tool to investigate non-Hermitian quantum many-body systems, beyond the reach of conventional numerical techniques such as the density-matrix renormalization group algorithm.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01072'&gt;arXiv:2508.01072&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 01 Aug 2025 21:02:41 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

To address these challenges, we introduce TensoMeta-VQC, a novel tensor-train (TT)-guided meta-learning framework designed to improve the robustness and scalability of VQC significantly. Our framework fully delegates the generation of quantum circuit parameters to a classical TT network, effectively decoupling optimization from quantum hardware. This innovative parameterization mitigates gradient vanishing, enhances noise resilience through structured low-rank representations, and facilitates efficient gradient propagation. Based on Neural Tangent Kernel and statistical learning theory, our rigorous theoretical analyses establish strong guarantees on approximation capability, optimization stability, and generalization performance. Extensive empirical results across quantum dot classification, Max-Cut optimization, and molecular quantum simulation tasks demonstrate that TensoMeta-VQC consistently achieves superior performance and robust noise tolerance, establishing it as a principled pathway toward practical and scalable VQC on near-term quantum devices.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01116'&gt;arXiv:2508.01116&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 01 Aug 2025 23:37:55 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Gustavo Diniz, Silvio Quintino, Vivian V. França&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Quantum dots are versatile systems for exploring quantum transport, electron correlations, and many-body phenomena such as the Kondo effect. While equilibrium properties are well understood through methods like the numerical renormalization group and density matrix renormalization group, nonequilibrium transport remains a major theoretical challenge. From the experimental point of view, recent advances in nanofabrication and measurement techniques have enabled the investigation of far-from-equilibrium regimes. These conditions give rise to new transport phenomena, where strong correlations and nonequilibrium dynamics interplay in complex ways; beyond the reach of conventional linear response theory. To meet these challenges, new approaches such as nonequilibrium Green's functions, real-time NRG, and time-dependent DMRG have emerged. This work reviews the established results for quantum dot transport in and beyond the linear regime, highlights recent theoretical and experimental advances, and discusses open problems and future prospects.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01376'&gt;arXiv:2508.01376&lt;/a&gt;] Published Sat, 02 Aug 2025 14:12:58 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Bose-Hubbard model in the canonical ensemble: a beyond mean-field approach</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01692</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Tista Banerjee&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Ultracold atoms in optical lattices are versatile testbeds to study and manipulate equilibrium and out-of-equilibrium aspects of quantum many-body systems whose behavior can be described by Hubbard-type Hamiltonians. In this paper, we consider an ansatz wave-function which respects total particle-number conservation for such systems and goes beyond mean-field theory; this wave-function has the same complexity in the number of parameters as the mean-field Gutzwiller ansatz, and captures quantum correlations and entanglement via projection onto an effective low-energy manifold. This ansatz can be exploited to study quantum phases observed in a large class of systems realizable in such experimental platforms and is useful to study quantum dynamics. We show that the relaxation dynamics of various out-of-equilibrium initial states under sudden quench of Hamiltonian parameters can be studied with this ansatz wavefunction within the framework of time-dependent variational principle. We present a quantitative comparison with small-scale exact diagonalization results in the 1D Bose-Hubbard model with and without external trapping potentials.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01692'&gt;arXiv:2508.01692&lt;/a&gt;] Published Sun, 03 Aug 2025 09:51:35 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Dynamical axion fields coupled with one-dimensional spinless fermions</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02370</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Yuto Hosogi, Koichiro Furutani, Yuki Kawaguchi&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We investigate coupled dynamics of spinless fermions on a one-dimensional lattice and spins on the links. When the hopping integral and the on-site potential of the fermions depend on the direction of the link spins, the low-energy effective theory predicts that the link spins behave as a dynamical axion field in 1+1 dimensions. The axion field $\theta$ is coupled to the electric field $E$ as $\theta E$, through which the link spins rotate in response to the applied electric field or the chemical potential gradient for charge-neutral fermions. This is the inverse phenomenon of Thouless pumping in the Rice-Mele model. After analyzing the dynamics by approximating the link spins with the classical ones and utilizing the axion Lagrangian, we show the full-quantum dynamics using the tensor network method. Even though we do not explicitly introduce the axion Lagrangian in solving the fermion-spin coupled many-body dynamics, the full-quantum results agree well with those with the classical spin approximation, including the dynamics of the axion field and fermion transport. In addition, we find that the quantum correlation between spins accelerates the dynamics of axion fields as the suppression of the expectation values of the link spins allows them to rotate easily. We also propose a possible experimental setup for cold-atomic systems to implement the Hamiltonian in this study.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02370'&gt;arXiv:2508.02370&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 04 Aug 2025 13:00:48 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Diverging conditional correlation lengths in the approach to high temperature</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02567</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Jerome Lloyd, Dmitry A. Abanin, Sarang Gopalakrishnan&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The Markov length was recently proposed as an information-theoretic diagnostic for quantum mixed-state phase transitions [Sang &amp; Hsieh, Phys. Rev. Lett. 134, 070403 (2025)]. Here, we show that the Markov length diverges even under classical stochastic dynamics, when a low-temperature ordered state is quenched into the high temperature phase. Conventional observables do not exhibit growing length scales upon quenching into the high-temperature phase; however, the Markov length grows exponentially in time. Consequently, the state of a system as it heats becomes increasingly non-Gibbsian, and the range of its putative "parent Hamiltonian" must diverge with the Markov length. From this information-theoretic point of view the late-time limit of thermalization is singular. We introduce a numerical technique for computing the Markov length based on matrix-product states, and explore its dynamics under general thermal quenches in the one-dimensional classical Ising model. For all cases, we provide simple information-theoretic arguments that explain our results.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02567'&gt;arXiv:2508.02567&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 04 Aug 2025 16:21:44 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Yuanjie Ren, Kaifeng Bu, Andreas Bauer&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We introduce a graphical calculus, consisting of a set of fermionic tensors with tensor-network equations, which can be used to perform various computations in fermionic many-body physics purely diagrammatically. The indices of our tensors primarily correspond to fermionic modes, but also include qubits and fixed odd-parity states. Our graphical calculus extends the ZX calculus for systems involving qubits. We apply the calculus in order to represent various objects, operations, and computations in physics, including fermionic Gaussian states, the partial trace of Majorana modes, purification protocols, fermionization and bosonization maps, and the construction of fermionic codes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03976'&gt;arXiv:2508.03976&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 06 Aug 2025 00:01:15 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Quantum circuit complexity and unsupervised machine learning of topological order</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04486</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Yanming Che, Clemens Gneiting, Xiaoguang Wang, Franco Nori&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Inspired by the close relationship between Kolmogorov complexity and unsupervised machine learning, we explore quantum circuit complexity, an important concept in quantum computation and quantum information science, as a pivot to understand and to build interpretable and efficient unsupervised machine learning for topological order in quantum many-body systems. To span a bridge from conceptual power to practical applicability, we present two theorems that connect Nielsen's quantum circuit complexity for the quantum path planning between two arbitrary quantum many-body states with fidelity change and entanglement generation, respectively. Leveraging these connections, fidelity-based and entanglement-based similarity measures or kernels, which are more practical for implementation, are formulated. Using the two proposed kernels, numerical experiments targeting the unsupervised clustering of quantum phases of the bond-alternating XXZ spin chain, the ground state of Kitaev's toric code and random product states, are conducted, demonstrating their superior performance. Relations with classical shadow tomography and shadow kernel learning are also discussed, where the latter can be naturally derived and understood from our approach. Our results establish connections between key concepts and tools of quantum circuit computation, quantum complexity, and machine learning of topological quantum order.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04486'&gt;arXiv:2508.04486&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 06 Aug 2025 14:36:10 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Absolutely maximally entangled pure states of multipartite quantum systems</title>

Due to maximal possible correlations between any two selected subsystems these states have numerous applications in various fields of quantum information processing including multi-user teleportation, quantum error correction and secret sharing. We present an updated survey of various techniques to generate such strongly entangled states, including those going beyond the standard construction of graph and stabilizer states. Our contribution includes, in particular, analysis of the degree of entanglement of reduced states obtained by partial trace of AME projectors, states obtained by a symmetric superposition of GHZ states, an orthogonal frequency square representation of the "golden" AME state and an updated summary of the number of local unitary equivalence classes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04777'&gt;arXiv:2508.04777&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 06 Aug 2025 18:00:13 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Nikhil Kumar Rajput, Riya Bansal&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Quantum computing holds transformative potential for medical applications, yet efficiently preparing quantum states from complex medical data remains a fundamental challenge. This survey provides a comprehensive examination of current approaches for encoding medical information into quantum systems, analyzing theoretical principles, algorithmic advancements, and practical limitations. It discusses tensor network decomposition, variational quantum algorithms, quantum machine learning techniques, and specialized error mitigation strategies for medical computing. The findings indicate that quantum advantages in medicine rely on leveraging inherent data structures such as spatial correlations in imaging, temporal patterns in physiological signals, and hierarchical biological organization. While current hardware restricts implementations to small-scale problems, emerging methods show potential for near-term use. The study provides a structured framework for assessing when quantum state preparation outperforms classical approaches in medicine, along with implementation guidelines and performance benchmarks.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05063'&gt;arXiv:2508.05063&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 07 Aug 2025 06:29:06 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Symmetry breaking and competing valence bond states in the star lattice Heisenberg antiferromagnet</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05133</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Pratyay Ghosh, Jan Koziol, Samuel Nyckees, Kai Phillip Schmidt, Frédéric Mila&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We investigate the ground state phase diagram of the spin-$1/2$ antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model on the star lattice using infinite projected entangled pair states (iPEPS) and high-order series expansions. The model includes two distinct couplings: $J_d$ on the dimer bonds and $J_t$ on the trimer bonds. While it is established that the system hosts a valence bond solid (VBS) phase for $J_d \ge J_t$, the ground state phase diagram for $J_d &lt; J_t$ has remained unsettled. Our iPEPS simulations uncover a first-order phase transition at $J_d/J_t \approx 0.18$, significantly lower than previously reported estimates. Beyond this transition, we identify a close competition between two valence bond crystal (VBC) states: a columnar VBC and a $\sqrt{3} \times \sqrt{3}$ VBC, with the latter consistently exhibiting lower energy across all finite bond dimensions. The high-order series expansion supports this by finding that the $\sqrt{3} \times \sqrt{3}$ VBC state indeed becomes energetically favorable, but only at sixth order in perturbation theory, revealing the subtle nature of the competition between candidate states.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05133'&gt;arXiv:2508.05133&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 07 Aug 2025 08:12:38 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Hybrid quantum tensor networks for aeroelastic applications</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05169</link>

Lautaro Hickmann, Pedro Alves, David Quero, Friedhelm Schwenker, Hans-Martin Rieser&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We investigate the application of hybrid quantum tensor networks to aeroelastic problems, harnessing the power of Quantum Machine Learning (QML). By combining tensor networks with variational quantum circuits, we demonstrate the potential of QML to tackle complex time series classification and regression tasks. Our results showcase the ability of hybrid quantum tensor networks to achieve high accuracy in binary classification. Furthermore, we observe promising performance in regressing discrete variables. While hyperparameter selection remains a challenge, requiring careful optimisation to unlock the full potential of these models, this work contributes significantly to the development of QML for solving intricate problems in aeroelasticity. We present an end-to-end trainable hybrid algorithm. We first encode time series into tensor networks to then utilise trainable tensor networks for dimensionality reduction, and convert the resulting tensor to a quantum circuit in the encoding step. Then, a tensor network inspired trainable variational quantum circuit is applied to solve either a classification or a multivariate or univariate regression task in the aeroelasticity domain.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05169'&gt;arXiv:2508.05169&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 07 Aug 2025 09:00:18 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Quantum criticality and emergent orders in the spin-1 bilinear-biquadratic-Kitaev chain</title>

We investigate a one-dimensional spin-1 chain where quadrupolar order is promoted by two distinct mechanisms: conventional bilinear-biquadratic exchange and bond-directional antiferromagnetic Kitaev frustration. Using density matrix renormalization group calculations, we determine the complete ground-state phase diagram and uncover two emergent phases induced by the Kitaev interaction: a Kitaev nematic phase and a Kitaev-dimer phase. The Kitaev nematic phase emerges from a fragile biquadratic dimer state via a continuous quantum phase transition in the Ising universality class. The Kitaev dimer phase spontaneously breaks a screw symmetry to favor either $x$- or $y$-spin bonding, forming a gapped state that coexists with a crystalline order of alternating $\mathbb{Z}_2$ fluxes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05216'&gt;arXiv:2508.05216&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 07 Aug 2025 09:54:37 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Symmetry Resolved Entanglement Entropy in a Non-Abelian Fractional Quantum Hall State</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05494</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Mark J. Arildsen, Valentin Crépel, Nicolas Regnault, Benoit Estienne&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Symmetry-resolved entanglement entropy provides a powerful framework for probing the internal structure of quantum many-body states by decomposing entanglement into contributions from distinct symmetry sectors. In this work, we apply matrix product state techniques to study the bosonic, non-Abelian Moore-Read quantum Hall state, enabling precise numerical evaluation of both the full counting statistics and symmetry-resolved entanglement entropies. Our results reveal an approximate equipartition of entanglement among symmetry sectors, consistent with theoretical expectations and subject to finite-size corrections. The results also show that these expectations for symmetry-resolved entanglement entropy remain valid in the case of a non-Abelian state where the topological sectors cannot be distinguished by the Abelian $\mathrm{U}(1)$ symmetry alone, and where neutral and charged modes possess distinct velocities. We additionally perform a detailed comparison of the entanglement spectrum with predictions from the Li-Haldane conjecture, finding remarkable agreement, and enabling a more precise understanding of the effects of the distinct neutral and charged velocities. This not only provides a stringent test of the conjecture but also highlights its explanatory power in understanding the origin and structure of finite-size effects across different symmetry sectors.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05494'&gt;arXiv:2508.05494&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 07 Aug 2025 15:33:33 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Partial projected ensembles and spatiotemporal structure of information scrambling</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05632</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Saptarshi Mandal, Pieter W. Claeys, Sthitadhi Roy&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Thermalisation and information scrambling in out-of-equilibrium quantum many-body systems are deeply intertwined: local subsystems dynamically approach thermal density matrices while their entropies track information spreading. Projected ensembles--ensembles of pure states conditioned on measurement outcomes of complementary subsystems--provide higher-order probes of thermalisation, converging at late times to universal maximum-entropy ensembles. In this work, we introduce the partial projected ensemble (PPE) as a framework to study how the spatiotemporal structure of scrambling is imprinted on projected ensembles. The PPE consists of an ensemble of mixed states induced on a subsystem by measurements on a spatially separated part of its complement, tracing out the remainder, naturally capturing scenarios involving discarded outcomes or noise-induced losses. We show that statistical fluctuations of the PPE faithfully track the causal lightcone of information spreading, revealing how scrambling dynamics are encoded in ensemble structure. In addition, we demonstrate that the probabilities of bit-string probabilities (PoPs) associated with the PPE exhibit distinct dynamical regimes and provide an experimentally accessible probe of scrambling. Both PPE fluctuations and PoPs display exponential sensitivity to the size of the discarded region, reflecting exponential degradation of quantum correlations under erasure. We substantiate these findings using the non-integrable kicked Ising chain, combining numerics in the ergodic regime with exact results at its self-dual point. We extend our analysis to a many-body localised (MBL) regime numerically, along with analytic results for the $\ell$-bit model. The linear and logarithmic lightcones characteristic of ergodic and MBL regimes emerge naturally from PPE dynamics, establishing it as a powerful tool for probing scrambling and deep thermalisation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05632'&gt;arXiv:2508.05632&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 07 Aug 2025 17:59:31 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Hyperbolic tiling neighborhoods in O(1) time</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04765</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Yanick Thurn, Manuel Schrauth, Johanna Erdmenger&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Tilings of the hyperbolic plane are of significant interest among many branches of mathematics, physics and computer science. Yet, their construction remains a non-trivial task. Current approaches primarily use tree-based recursive algorithms, which are fundamentally limited: they do not readily yield the neighborhood graph representing cell adjacencies, which is however required for many applications. We introduce a novel approach that allows to build hyperbolic tilings and their associated graph structure simultaneously, using only combinatoric rules without requiring an explicit coordinate representation. This allows to generate arbitrarily large, exact hyperbolic graphs, with an algorithmic complexity that does not depend on the lattice size. We provide an easy-to-use implementation which substantially outperforms existing methods, hence rendering ultra large-scale numerical simulations on these geometric structures accessible for the scientific community.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04765'&gt;arXiv:2508.04765&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 06 Aug 2025 18:00:01 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Role of Plaquette Term in Genuine $2+1$D String Dynamics on Quantum Simulators</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05736</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Yizhuo Tian, N. S. Srivatsa, Kaidi Xu, Jesse J. Osborne, Umberto Borla, Jad C. Halimeh&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; With the advent of quantum simulators of $2+1$D lattice gauge theories (LGTs), a fundamental open question is under what circumstances the observed physics is genuinely $2+1$D rather than effectively $1+1$D. Here, we address this question in the ongoing strong effort to quantum-simulate string dynamics in $2+1$D LGTs on state-of-the-art quantum hardware. Through tensor network simulations and analytic derivations, we show that the plaquette term, which represents a magnetic field and only emerges in $d&gt;1$ spatial dimensions, plays a crucial role in \textit{genuine} $2+1$D string dynamics deep in the confined regime. In its absence and for minimal-length (Manhattan-distance) strings, we demonstrate how string breaking, although on a lattice in $d=2$ spatial dimensions, can be effectively mapped to a $1+1$D dynamical process independently of lattice geometry. Our findings not only answer the question of what qualifies as genuine $2+1$D string dynamics, but also serve as a clear guide for future quantum simulation experiments of $2+1$D LGTs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05736'&gt;arXiv:2508.05736&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 07 Aug 2025 18:00:00 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>MPS-JuliQAOA: User-friendly, Scalable MPS-based Simulation for Quantum Optimization</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Sean Feeney, Reuben Tate, John Golden, Stephan Eidenbenz&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We present the MPS-JuliQAOA simulator, a user-friendly, open-source tool to simulate the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) of any optimization problem that can be expressed as diagonal Hamiltonian. By leveraging Julia-language constructs and the ITensor package to implement a Matrix Product State (MPS) approach to simulating QAOA, MPS-Juli-QAOA effortlessly scales to 512 qubits and 20 simulation rounds on the standard de-facto benchmark 3-regular MaxCut QAOA problem. MPS-JuliQAOA also has built-in parameter finding capabilities, which is a crucial performance aspect of QAOA. We illustrate through examples that the user does not need to know MPS principles or complex automatic differentiation techniques to use MPS-JuliQAOA. We study the scalability of our tool with respect to runtime, memory usage and accuracy tradeoffs.

      <title>Diagonalizing large-scale quantum many-body Hamiltonians using variational quantum circuit and tensor network</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06159</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Peng-Fei Zhou, Shuang Qiao, An-Chun Ji, Shi-Ju Ran&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Exact diagonalization (ED) is an essential tool for exploring quantum many-body physics but is fundamentally limited by the exponentially-scaled computational complexity. Here, we propose tensor network variational diagonalization (TNVD), which encodes the full eigenenergy spectrum of a quantum many-body Hamiltonian into a matrix product state, and encodes the eigenstates as the evolutions of product states using variational quantum circuit (VQC). Thereby, TNVD reduces the computational complexity of diagonalization from exponential to polynomial in system size $N$. Numerical benchmarks up to $N=100$ spins are provided, which far surpass the computational limit of ED. We further consider quantum Ising model in a random field to reveal the underlying reliance between the efficiency of TNVD and entanglement properties of eigenstates. Typical signs, including the distribution of entanglement entropy (EE) versus eigenenergy and the density of state versus EE, are suggested to indicate area law of entanglement entropy or its violation, which are essential to the TNVD efficiency. Our work establishes TNVD as a powerful and scalable diagonalization approach for large-scale quantum many-body Hamiltonians. The incorporation of VQC lays a promising pathway to applying quantum computation to address the volume-law-EE Hamiltonians that lack efficient classical approaches.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06159'&gt;arXiv:2508.06159&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 08 Aug 2025 09:29:17 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

Hollenberg, Sergii Strelchuk&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; As quantum computing hardware advances, the need for algorithms that facilitate the loading of classical data into the quantum states of these devices has become increasingly important. This study presents a method for producing scalable quantum circuits to encode genomic data using the Matrix Product State (MPS) formalism. The method is illustrated by encoding the genome of the bacteriophage $\Phi X174$ into a 15-qubit state, and analysing the trade-offs between MPS bond dimension, reconstruction error, and the resulting circuit complexity. This study proposes methods for optimising encoding circuits with standard benchmark datasets for the emerging field of quantum bioinformatics. The results for circuit generation and simulation on HPC and on current quantum hardware demonstrate the viability and utility of the encoding.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06184'&gt;arXiv:2508.06184&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 08 Aug 2025 10:02:53 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Synthetic Data Generation and Differential Privacy using Tensor Networks' Matrix Product States (MPS)</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Alejandro Moreno R., Desale Fentaw, Samuel Palmer, Raúl Salles de Padua, Ninad Dixit, Samuel Mugel, Roman Orús, Manuel Radons, Josef Menter, Ali Abedi&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Synthetic data generation is a key technique in modern artificial intelligence, addressing data scarcity, privacy constraints, and the need for diverse datasets in training robust models. In this work, we propose a method for generating privacy-preserving high-quality synthetic tabular data using Tensor Networks, specifically Matrix Product States (MPS). We benchmark the MPS-based generative model against state-of-the-art models such as CTGAN, VAE, and PrivBayes, focusing on both fidelity and privacy-preserving capabilities. To ensure differential privacy (DP), we integrate noise injection and gradient clipping during training, enabling privacy guarantees via R\'enyi Differential Privacy accounting. Across multiple metrics analyzing data fidelity and downstream machine learning task performance, our results show that MPS outperforms classical models, particularly under strict privacy constraints. This work highlights MPS as a promising tool for privacy-aware synthetic data generation. By combining the expressive power of tensor network representations with formal privacy mechanisms, the proposed approach offers an interpretable and scalable alternative for secure data sharing. Its structured design facilitates integration into sensitive domains where both data quality and confidentiality are critical.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06251'&gt;arXiv:2508.06251&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 08 Aug 2025 12:14:57 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>A Tensor Train Approach for Deterministic Arithmetic Operations on Discrete Representations of Probability Distributions</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06303</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Gerhard Kirsten, Bilgesu Bilgin, Janith Petangoda, Phillip Stanley-Marbell&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Computing with discrete representations of high-dimensional probability distributions is fundamental to uncertainty quantification, Bayesian inference, and stochastic modeling. However, storing and manipulating such distributions suffers from the curse of dimensionality, as memory and computational costs grow exponentially with dimension. Monte Carlo methods require thousands to billions of samples, incurring high computational costs and producing inconsistent results due to stochasticity. We present an efficient tensor train method for performing exact arithmetic operations on discretizations of continuous probability distributions while avoiding exponential growth. Our approach leverages low-rank tensor train decomposition to represent latent random variables compactly using Dirac deltas, enabling deterministic addition, subtraction and multiplication operations directly in the compressed format. We develop an efficient implementation using sparse matrices and specialized data structures that further enhances performance. Theoretical analysis demonstrates polynomial scaling of memory and computational complexity under rank assumptions, and shows how statistics of latent variables can be computed with polynomial complexity. Numerical experiments spanning randomized linear algebra to stochastic differential equations demonstrate orders-of-magnitude improvements in memory usage and computational time compared to conventional approaches, enabling tractable deterministic computations on discretized random variables in previously intractable dimensions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06303'&gt;arXiv:2508.06303&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 08 Aug 2025 13:27:35 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Magnetically Mediated Cross-Layer Pairing in Pressurized Trilayer Nickelate La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$</title>

However, the pairing mechanism remains a subject of active investigations. With large-scale density matrix renormalization group calculations on a realistic two-orbital trilayer Hubbard model, we elucidate the superconducting (SC) mechanism in this system. Our results reveal distinct magnetic correlations in the two different orbitals: while the $d_{z^2}$ orbital exhibits both interlayer and cross-layer antiferromagnetic (AFM) correlations, the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital shows exclusively cross-layer AFM correlations, rendering a quasi-long-range SC order in the latter. We demonstrate that the Hund's rule coupling is essential for forming the SC order, and discuss the effects of kinetic AFM correlation and Hubbard repulsive $U$. Our findings motivate a further simplification of the trilayer Hubbard to an effective bilayer mixed-dimensional $t$-$J$ model, providing a unified framework for understanding interlayer SC in both trilayer and bilayer nickelates.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06802'&gt;arXiv:2508.06802&lt;/a&gt;] Published Sat, 09 Aug 2025 03:18:44 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>A Method for Constructing Quasi-Random Peaked Quantum Circuits</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; O. G. Udalov&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; An algorithm is proposed for constructing quasi-random "peaked" quantum circuits, i.e., circuits whose final qubit state exhibits a high probability concentration on a specific computational basis state. These circuits consist of random gates arranged in a brick-wall architecture. While the multiqubit state in the middle of the circuit can exhibit significant entanglement, the final state is, with high probability, a predetermined pure bitstring. A technique is introduced to obscure the final bitstring in the structure of the quantum circuit. The algorithm allows precise control over the probability of the final peaked state. A modified version of the algorithm enables the construction of double- or multi-peaked quantum circuits. The matrix product state (MPS) method is evaluated for simulating such circuits; it performs effectively for shallow peaked circuits but offers no significant advantage for deeper ones.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07491'&gt;arXiv:2508.07491&lt;/a&gt;] Published Sun, 10 Aug 2025 21:27:16 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Tomography-assisted noisy quantum circuit simulator using matrix product density operators</title>

However, experiments on real noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices often involve complex noise profiles, encompassing uncontrollable elements and instrument-specific effects such as crosstalk. To address these challenges, we employ quantum process tomography (QPT) techniques to directly capture the operational characteristics of the experimental setup and integrate them into numerical simulations using MPDOs. Our QPT-assisted MPDO simulator is then applied to explore a variational approach for generating noisy entangled states, comparing the results with standard noise numerical simulations and demonstrations conducted on the Quafu cloud quantum computation platform. Additionally, we investigate noisy MaxCut problems, as well as the effects of crosstalk and noise truncation. Our results provide valuable insights into the impact of noise on NISQ devices and lay the foundation for enhanced design and assessment of quantum algorithms in complex noise environments.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07610'&gt;arXiv:2508.07610&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 11 Aug 2025 04:29:59 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Quantum Circuit Complexity of Matrix-Product Unitaries</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Georgios Styliaris, Rahul Trivedi, J. Ignacio Cirac&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Matrix-product unitaries (MPUs) are many-body unitary operators that, as a consequence of their tensor-network structure, preserve the entanglement area law in 1D systems. However, it is unknown how to implement an MPU as a quantum circuit since the individual tensors describing the MPU are not unitary. In this paper, we show that a large class of MPUs can be implemented with a polynomial-depth quantum circuit. For an $N$-site MPU built from a repeated bulk tensor with open boundary, we explicitly construct a quantum circuit of polynomial depth $T = O(N^{\alpha})$ realizing the MPU, where the constant $\alpha$ depends only on the bulk and boundary tensor and not the system size $N$. We show that this class includes nontrivial unitaries that generate long-range entanglement and, in particular, contains a large class of unitaries constructed from representations of $C^*$-weak Hopf algebras. Furthermore, we also adapt our construction to nonuniform translationally-varying MPUs and show that they can be implemented by a circuit of depth $O(N^{\beta} \, \mathrm{poly}\, D)$ where $\beta \le 1 + \log_2 \sqrt{D}/ s_{\min}$, with $D$ being the bond dimension and $s_{\min}$ is the smallest nonzero Schmidt value of the normalized Choi state corresponding to the MPU.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08160'&gt;arXiv:2508.08160&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 11 Aug 2025 16:37:14 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Continuous topological phase transition between $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topologically ordered phases</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08376</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Qi Zhang, Wen-Tao Xu&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Topological phase transitions beyond anyon condensation remain poorly understood. A notable example is the transition between the toric code (TC) and double semion (DS) phases, which has two distinct $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological orders in (2 + 1)D. Previous studies reveal that the transition between them can be either first order or via an intermediate phase, thus the existence of a directly continuous transition between them remains a long-standing problem. Motivated by the fact that both phases can arise from condensing distinct anyons in the $\mathbb{Z}_4$ topological order, we introduce a perturbed $\mathbb{Z}_4$ quantum double (QD) model to study the TC-DS transition. We confirm the existence of a continuous (2 + 1)D XY* transition between the TC and DS phases by mapping it to a two-coupled quantum Ising model. Importantly, using the condensation order parameters and the area law coefficients of the Wilson loops, we further reveal that $\mathbb{Z}_4$ anyons, fractionalized from the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological orders, become deconfined at the transition between $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topologically ordered phases. Our results open a path toward developing a theoretical framework for topological phase transitions beyond anyon condensation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08376'&gt;arXiv:2508.08376&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 11 Aug 2025 18:02:02 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

Changlani, Yao Wang&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We investigate the Nagaoka-Thouless (NT) ferromagnetic instability in the strongly interacting $t$-$t'$ Hubbard model by continuously breaking particle-hole symmetry on a tunable square-triangular lattice geometry. We use an analytic approach to show that the fully spin-polarized state becomes unstable to a metastable spin-polaron when the kinetic frustration $t'/t$ exceeds a critical, dimension-dependent value. Large-scale density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations reveal a quantum phase transition from the NT ferromagnet to a spiral spin-density wave, which evolves continuously into the Haerter-Shastry antiferromagnet in the large-frustration limit. Remarkably, this transition remains robust at low but finite hole density, making it accessible in cold-atom and moir\'e Hubbard platforms under strong interactions. A variational analysis further captures the instability mechanism at finite density via frustration-induced magnon band deformation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08410'&gt;arXiv:2508.08410&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 11 Aug 2025 19:03:38 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Digital Quantum Simulation of Flat-Band and All-Bands-Flat Dynamics for Tunable Quantum Transport</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08734</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Mrinal Kanti Giri, Pochung Chen&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We study the dynamics on the flat-band (FB) and all-bands-flat (AFB) lattices using a digital quantum computer. By utilizing an advanced tensor network method to compress the quantum circuit, we overcome the intrinsic limitations of current noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computers. This enables high-fidelity simulations of time evolution over extended timescales and various interesting dynamical behaviours are observed in our digital quantum simulation. We start from the quantum simulation of the single-particle quantum walk on the FB and AFB lattices, which are realized by tuning the magnetic flux per plaquette to $\phi=0$ and $\phi=\pi$ respectively. With compressed quantum circuit, we are able to simulate the delocalization in FB lattice and the Aharonov-Bohm caging in AFB lattice. Next, we integrate FB and ABF lattices within a one-dimensional lattice structure and study how these lattices can be utilized to control quantum transport. Moreover, we investigate the effectiveness of a single ABF lattice in controlling the two particles dynamics without and with interaction. We find that the hopping amplitude remains an effective and tunable parameter for controlling particle transport even in the presence of interactions. Our results show that digital quantum simulations of flat-band physics are feasible on current digital NISQ devices through circuit compression. Moreover, this capability enables us to study the potential applications of flat-band systems in quantum control and emerging quantum technologies.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08734'&gt;arXiv:2508.08734&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 12 Aug 2025 08:27:17 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Neural quantum states for emitter dynamics in waveguide QED</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08964</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Tatiana Vovk, Anka Van de Walle, Hannes Pichler, Annabelle Bohrdt&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Quantum emitters coupled to one-dimensional waveguides constitute a paradigmatic quantum-optical platform for exploring collective phenomena in open quantum many-body systems. For appropriately spaced emitters, they realize the Dicke model, whose characteristic permutation symmetry allows for efficient exact solutions featuring superradiance. When the emitters are arbitrarily spaced, however, this symmetry is lost and general analytical solutions are no longer available. In this work, we introduce a novel numerical method to study the dynamics of such systems by extending the time-dependent neural quantum state (t-NQS) framework to open quantum systems. We benchmark our approach across a range of waveguide QED settings and compare its performance with tensor-network calculations. Our results demonstrate that the t-NQS approach is competitive with other numerical methods and highlight the potential of t-NQSs for studying open quantum many-body systems out of equilibrium.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08964'&gt;arXiv:2508.08964&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 12 Aug 2025 14:30:58 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

To overcome the biggest challenge of photon-based QCA experiments, photon loss, we report new Gaussian boson sampling (GBS) experiments with 1024 high-efficiency squeezed states injected into a hybrid spatial-temporal encoded, 8176-mode, programmable photonic quantum processor, Jiuzhang 4.0, which produces up to 3050 photon detection events. Our experimental results outperform all classical spoofing algorithms, particularly the matrix product state (MPS) method, which was recently proposed to utilise photon loss to reduce the classical simulation complexity of GBS. Using the state-of-the-art MPS algorithm on the most powerful supercomputer EI Capitan, it would take &gt; $10^{42}$ years to construct the required tensor network for simulation, while our Jiuzhang 4.0 quantum computer takes 25.6 $\mu$s to produce a sample. This work establishes a new frontier of QCA and paves the way to fault-tolerant photonic quantum computing hardware.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09092'&gt;arXiv:2508.09092&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 12 Aug 2025 17:17:40 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Entropy Measures for Transition Matrices in Random Systems</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09261</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Zhaohui Chen, Rene Meyer, Zhuo-Yu Xian&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; A transition matrix can be constructed through the partial contraction of two given quantum states. We analyze and compare four different definitions of entropy for transition matrices, including (modified) pseudo entropy, SVD entropy, and ABB entropy. We examine the probabilistic interpretation of each entropy measure and show that only the distillation interpretation of ABB entropy corresponds to the joint success probability of distilling entanglement between the two quantum states used to construct the transition matrix. Combining the transition matrix with preceding measurements and subsequent non-unitary operations, the ABB entropy either decreases or remains unchanged, whereas the pseudo-entropy and SVD entropy may increase or decrease. We further apply these entropy measures to transition matrices constructed from several ensembles: (i) pairs of independent Haar-random states; (ii) bi-orthogonal eigenstates of non-Hermitian random systems; and (iii) bi-orthogonal states in $PT$-symmetric systems near their exceptional points. Across all cases considered, the SVD and ABB entropies of the transition matrix closely mirror the behavior of the subsystem entanglement entropy of a single random state, in contrast to the (modified) pseudo entropy, which can exceed the bound of subsystem size, fail to scale with system size, or even take complex values.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09261'&gt;arXiv:2508.09261&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 12 Aug 2025 18:04:55 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Tensor-network formulation of QCD in the strong-coupling expansion</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Thomas Samberger, Jacques Bloch, Robert Lohmayer, Tilo Wettig&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We present a tensor-network formulation for the strong-coupling expansion of QCD with staggered quarks at non-zero chemical potential, for arbitrary number of dimensions, colors, and flavors. We integrate out the gauge and quark degrees of freedom and rewrite the partition function as the complete trace of a tensor network. This network consists of local tensors that contain a numerical and a Grassmann part. We truncate the initial tensor at a fixed order in the inverse coupling $\beta$ and compute analytical results for the partition function, the free energy, and the chiral condensate on a $2\times2$ lattice up to order $\beta^4$. In a follow-up paper we will introduce an enhanced tensor-network method, order-separated GHOTRG, to explicitly compute the expansion coefficients of the partition function for larger lattices.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09891'&gt;arXiv:2508.09891&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 13 Aug 2025 15:49:37 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Quantum circuit simulation with a local time-dependent variational principle</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10096</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Aaron Sander, Maximilian Fröhlich, Mazen Ali, Martin Eigel, Jens Eisert, Michael Hintermüller, Christian B. Mendl, Richard M. Milbradt, Robert Wille&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Classical simulations of quantum circuits are vital for assessing potential quantum advantage and benchmarking devices, yet they require sophisticated methods to avoid the exponential growth of resources. Tensor network approaches, in particular matrix product states (MPS) combined with the time-evolving block decimation (TEBD) algorithm, currently dominate large-scale circuit simulations. These methods scale efficiently when entanglement is limited but suffer rapid bond dimension growth with increasing entanglement and handle long-range gates via costly SWAP insertions. Motivated by the success of the time-dependent variational principle (TDVP) in many-body physics, we reinterpret quantum circuits as a series of discrete time evolutions, using gate generators to construct an MPS-based circuit simulation via a local TDVP formulation. This addresses TEBD's key limitations by (1) naturally accommodating long-range gates and (2) optimally representing states on the MPS manifold. By diffusing entanglement more globally, the method suppresses local bond growth and reduces memory and runtime costs. We benchmark the approach on five 49-qubit circuits: three Hamiltonian circuits (1D open and periodic Heisenberg, 2D 7x7 Ising) and two algorithmic ones (quantum approximate optimization, hardware-efficient ansatz). Across all cases, our method yields substantial resource reductions over standard tools, establishing a new state-of-the-art for circuit simulation and enabling advances across quantum computing, condensed matter, and beyond.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10096'&gt;arXiv:2508.10096&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 13 Aug 2025 18:00:02 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

The central innovation of our method lies in utilizing variational boundary tensors as a globally optimized environment for the entire system. Based on this optimized environment, we construct renormalization projectors that significantly enhance accuracy. By leveraging the canonical form of tensors, our algorithm maintains the same computational complexity as the original tensor renormalization group (TRG) method, yet achieves higher accuracy than existing approaches that do not incorporate entanglement filtering. Our work offers a practical pathway for extending TRG methods to higher dimensions while keeping computational costs manageable.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10418'&gt;arXiv:2508.10418&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 14 Aug 2025 07:51:15 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

For a two-dimensional cylinder with a smooth edge, we identify discrete particle-number transitions that lead to a spin-polarized edge state stabilized by an emergent ferromagnetic exchange interaction. The reconstruction is orbital-selective, occurring predominantly in the $s$-orbital channel. Our results reveal a fully microscopic mechanism for emergent spin polarization at the edge that could compromise the topological protection of helical edge states by time reversal symmetry.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10726'&gt;arXiv:2508.10726&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 14 Aug 2025 15:09:05 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Gauging the variational optimization of projected entangled-pair states</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Wei Tang, Laurens Vanderstraeten, Jutho Haegeman&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Projected entangled-pair states (PEPS) constitute a powerful variational ansatz for capturing ground state physics of two-dimensional quantum systems. However, accurately computing and minimizing the energy expectation value remains challenging, in part because the impact of the gauge degrees of freedom that are present in the tensor network representation is poorly understood. We analyze the role of gauge transformations for the case of a U(1)-symmetric PEPS with point group symmetry, thereby reducing the gauge degrees of freedom to a single class. We show how gradient-based optimization strategies exploit the gauge freedom, causing the tensor network contraction to become increasingly inaccurate and to produce artificially low variational energies. Furthermore, we develop a gauge-fixed optimization strategy that largely suppresses this effect, resulting in a more robust optimization. Our study underscores the need for gauge-aware optimization strategies to guarantee reliability of variational PEPS in general settings.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10822'&gt;arXiv:2508.10822&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 14 Aug 2025 16:47:58 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

Izmaylov, Matthew Otten&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Ground State Energy Estimation (GSEE) is a central problem in quantum chemistry and condensed matter physics, demanding efficient algorithms to solve complex electronic structure calculations. This work introduces a structured benchmarking framework for evaluating the performance of both classical and quantum solvers on diverse GSEE problem instances. We assess three prominent methods -- Semistochastic Heat-Bath Configuration Interaction (SHCI), Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG), and Double-Factorized Quantum Phase Estimation (DF QPE) -- ighlighting their respective strengths and limitations. Our results show that fully optimized SHCI achieves near-universal solvability on the benchmark set, DMRG excels for low-entanglement systems, and DF QPE is currently constrained by hardware and algorithmic limitations. However, we observe that many benchmark Hamiltonians are drawn from datasets tailored to SHCI and related approaches, introducing a bias that favors classical solvers. To mitigate this, we propose expanding the benchmark suite to include more challenging, strongly correlated systems to enable a more balanced and forward-looking evaluation of solver capabilities. As quantum hardware and algorithms improve, this benchmarking framework will serve as a vital tool for tracking progress and identifying domains where quantum methods may surpass classical techniques. The QB-GSEE benchmark repository is openly available at https://github.com/isi-usc-edu/qb-gsee-benchmark [1]. By maintaining a scalable and open resource, we aim to accelerate innovation in computational quantum chemistry and quantum computing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10873'&gt;arXiv:2508.10873&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 14 Aug 2025 17:45:28 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Random Permutation Circuits are Quantum Chaotic</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10890</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Bruno Bertini, Katja Klobas, Pavel Kos, Daniel Malz&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Random permutation circuits were recently introduced as minimal models for local many-body dynamics that can be interpreted both as classical and quantum. Standard indicators of chaos such as damage spreading, show that these systems exhibit sensitivity to initial conditions in the classical setting. Here, we address their quantum chaoticity by studying the time evolution of local operator entanglement (LOE). We show that the behaviour of LOE in random permutation circuits depends on the dimension of the local configuration space q. When q = 2, i.e. the circuits act on qubits, random permutations are Clifford and the LOE of any local operator is bounded by a constant, indicating that they are not truly chaotic. On the other hand, when the dimension of the local configuration space exceeds two, the LOE grows linearly in time. We prove this in the limit of large dimensions and present numerical evidence that a three-dimensional local configuration space is sufficient for a linear growth of LOE. Our findings highlight that quantum chaos can be produced by essentially classical dynamics. Moreover, we show that LOE can be defined also in the classical realm and put it forward as a universal indicator chaos, both quantum and classical.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10890'&gt;arXiv:2508.10890&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 14 Aug 2025 17:57:10 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Gapped spinful phases obtained via Gutzwiller projections of Euler states</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10957</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Thorsten B. Wahl, Lukas Devos, Robert-Jan Slager&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Gutzwiller projections of non-interacting chiral topological phases are known to give rise to fractional, topologically ordered chiral phases. Here, we carry out a similar construction using two copies of non-interacting Euler insulators to produce a class of spinful interacting Euler models. To that end, we take advantage of the recently discovered exact representation of certain Euler insulators by a projected entangled pair state (PEPS) of bond dimension $D = 2$. The Gutzwiller projection can be implemented within the tensor network formalism, giving rise to a new PEPS of bond dimension $D = 4$. We, moreover, apply very recent state-of-the-art tensor network tools to evaluate these phases. In particular, we analyze its entanglement entropy scaling and find no topological correction to the area law, indicating that the state is not intrinsically topologically ordered. Its entanglement spectrum shows a clear cusp at momentum zero, similar to non-interacting Euler insulators, and the spectrum of the transfer operator indicates that the state is gapped, which could imply non-intrinsic topological features. Finally, the static structure factor displays Bragg peaks, indicating the simultaneous presence of local order.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10957'&gt;arXiv:2508.10957&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 14 Aug 2025 12:18:23 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Spontaneously Broken Non-Invertible Symmetries in Transverse-Field Ising Qudit Chains</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11003</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Kristian Tyn Kai Chung, Umberto Borla, Andriy H. Nevidomskyy, Sergej Moroz&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; \usepackage{iopams} Recent developments have revealed that symmetries need not form a group, but instead can be non-invertible. Here we use analytical arguments and numerical evidence to illuminate how spontaneous symmetry breaking of a non-invertible symmetry is similar yet distinct from ordinary, invertible, symmetry breaking. We consider one-dimensional chains of group-valued qudits, whose local Hilbert space is spanned by elements of a finite group $G$ (reducing to ordinary qubits when $G=\mathbb{Z}_2$). We construct Ising-type transverse-field Hamiltonians with Rep($G$) symmetry whose generators multiply according to the tensor product of irreducible representations (irreps) of the group $G$. For non-Abelian $G$, the symmetry is non-invertible. In the symmetry broken phase there is one ground state per irrep on a closed chain. The symmetry breaking can be detected by local order parameters but, unlike the invertible case, different ground states have distinct entanglement patterns. We show that for each irrep of dimension greater than one the corresponding ground state exhibits string order, entanglement spectrum degeneracies, and has gapless edge modes on an open chain -- features usually associated with symmetry-protected topological order. Consequently, domain wall excitations behave as one-dimensional non-Abelian anyons with non-trivial internal Hilbert spaces and fusion rules. Our work identifies properties of non-invertible symmetry breaking that existing quantum hardware can probe.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11003'&gt;arXiv:2508.11003&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 14 Aug 2025 18:11:14 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Goal-Oriented Low-Rank Tensor Decompositions for Numerical Simulation Data</title>

Shadid, Edward Phillips&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We introduce a new low-dimensional model of high-dimensional numerical simulation data based on low-rank tensor decompositions. Our new model aims to minimize differences between the model data and simulation data as well as functions of the model data and functions of the simulation data. This novel approach to dimensionality reduction of simulation data provides a means of directly incorporating quantities of interests and invariants associated with conservation principles associated with the simulation data into the low-dimensional model, thus enabling more accurate analysis of the simulation without requiring access to the full set of high-dimensional data. Computational results of applying this approach to two standard low-rank tensor decompositions of data arising from simulation of combustion and plasma physics are presented.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11139'&gt;arXiv:2508.11139&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 15 Aug 2025 01:13:15 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Fermi-liquid-like phase driven by next-nearest-neighbor couplings in a lightly doped kagome-lattice $t$-$J$ model</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11322</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Xu-Yan Jia, Fan Yang, D. N. Sheng, Shou-Shu Gong&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Due to the interplay between charge fluctuation and geometry frustration, the doped kagome-lattice Mott insulator is a fascinating platform to realize exotic quantum states. Through the state-of-the-art density matrix renormalization group calculation, we explore the quantum phases of the lightly doped kagome-lattice $t$-$J$ model in the presence of the next-nearest-neighbor electron hopping $t_2$ and spin interaction $J_2$. On the $L_y = 3$ cylinder ($L_y$ is the number of unit cells along the circumference direction), we establish a quantum phase diagram with tuning $t_2 &gt; 0$ and $J_2 &gt; 0$, showing an emergent Fermi-liquid-like phase driven by increased $t_2$ and $J_2$, which sits at the neighbor of the previously identified charge density wave (CDW) phase. Compared with the CDW phase, the charge order is significantly suppressed in the Fermi-liquid-like phase, and most correlation functions are greatly enhanced with power-law decay. In particular, we find the absence of hole pairing and a strong three-sublattice magnetic correlation. On the wider $L_y = 4$ cylinder, this Fermi-liquid-like phase persists at low doping levels, strongly suggesting that this state might be stable in the two-dimensional kagome system.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11322'&gt;arXiv:2508.11322&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 15 Aug 2025 08:47:09 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>AdaRing: Towards Ultra-Light Vision-Language Adaptation via Cross-Layer Tensor Ring Decomposition</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11870</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Ying Huang, Yuanbin Man, Wenqi Jia, Zhengzhong Tu, Junzhou Huang, Miao Yin&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Adapter-based fine-tuning has gained remarkable attention in adapting large pre-trained vision language models (VLMs) for a wide range of downstream tasks efficiently. In this paradigm, only the inserted adapters are fine-tuned, without the need for training the original VLM backbone. Existing works scale adapters by integrating them into every layer of VLMs to increase the capacity of adapters. However, these methods face two primary limitations: 1) limited compression rate due to ignoring cross-layer redundancy, and 2) limited representational capacity across homogeneous adapters. In this paper, we propose a novel vision-language fine-tuning framework based on cross-layer tensor ring decomposition (TRD) with the integration and collaboration of diverse adapters, called AdaRing, achieving ultra-light parameter-efficient adaptation of VLMs on various tasks. To remove the high redundancy that exists among adapters across layers, we exploit the tensor-level low-rankness to formulate adapters as layer-shared tensor cores and layer-specific slices. Moreover, guided by generalization-aware fine-tuning, diverse rank-driven adapters cooperate to handle tasks that require different representations. Our experiments show that the proposed AdaRing achieves the state-of-the-art performance while reducing average training parameters by 90%.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11870'&gt;arXiv:2508.11870&lt;/a&gt;] Published Sat, 16 Aug 2025 01:56:27 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Simulating Quantum Turbulence with Matrix Product States</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12191</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Felipe Gómez-Lozada, Nicolas Perico-García, Nikita Gourianov, Hayder Salman, Juan José Mendoza-Arenas&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Quantum turbulence spans length scales from the system size $L$ to the healing length $\xi$, making direct numerical simulations (DNS) of the Gross-Pitaevskii (GP) equation computationally expensive when $L \gg \xi$. We present a matrix product state (MPS) solver for the GP equation that efficiently compresses the wavefunction by truncating weak interlength-scale correlations. This approach reduces memory use by factors ranging from 10x to over 10,000x compared to DNS. We benchmark our approach on nonlinear excitations, namely dark solitons (1D) and quantized vortices (2D, 3D), capturing key dynamics like Kelvin wave propagation and vortex ring emission in the case of vortex line reconnection. For turbulent states composed of multiple nonlinear excitations, we find that the memory compression of the MPS representation is directly proportional to the soliton or vortex densities. We also accurately reproduce established results from two-point correlation functions and energy spectra, where we recover the incompressible kinetic energy spectrum with little memory overhead. These results demonstrate the representative capabilities of the MPS ansatz for quantum turbulence and pave the way for studying this nonequilibrium state using previously-prohibited system sizes to uncover possible new physics.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12191'&gt;arXiv:2508.12191&lt;/a&gt;] Published Sun, 17 Aug 2025 00:50:52 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

Central to this effort is the development of invariant and equivariant operations. This works presents a systematic method for constructing valid invariant and equivariant operations. It can handle inputs and outputs in the form of Cartesian tensors with different rank, as well as spherical tensors with different types. In addition, our method features a graphical representation utilizing the symmetric tensor network, which simplifies both the proofs and constructions related to invariant and equivariant functions. We also apply this approach to design the equivariant interaction message for the geometry graph neural network, and equivariant machine learning model to learn the constitutive law of materials.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12596'&gt;arXiv:2508.12596&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 18 Aug 2025 03:13:08 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Quantum State Preparation by Improved MPS Method</title>

However, the preparation of an arbitrary amplitude-encoded state has been proven to be time-consuming, and its deployment on current noisy devices can be challenging. In this work, we propose an improved Matrix Product State(MPS) method preparation protocol with an exponential reduction on the circuit depth, as well as topological adaptability. By refined utilization of the disentangling principle, we also reduce approximately 33% two-qubit gate count. To validate our method, we study various families of functions and distributions with provably bounded MPS rank. Numerical experiments show that our method significantly reduces circuit depth while achieving higher fidelity for states arising in financial and other applications.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12821'&gt;arXiv:2508.12821&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 18 Aug 2025 11:04:30 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Computing Exchange Coupling constants in Transition metal complexes with Tensor Product Selected Configuration Interaction</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13002</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Arnab Bachhar, Nicholas J. Mayhall&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Transition metal complexes present significant challenges for electronic structure theory due to strong electron correlation arising from partially filled $d$-orbitals. We compare our recently developed Tensor Product Selected Configuration Interaction (TPSCI) with Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) for computing exchange coupling constants in six transition metal systems, including dinuclear Cr, Fe, and Mn complexes and a tetranuclear Ni-cubane. TPSCI uses a locally correlated tensor product state basis to capture electronic structure efficiently while maintaining interpretability. From calculations on active spaces ranging from (22e,29o) to (42e,49o), we find that TPSCI consistently yields higher variational energies than DMRG due to truncation of local cluster states, but provides magnetic exchange coupling constants (J) generally within 10-30 cm$^{-1}$ of DMRG results. Key advantages include natural multistate capability enabling direct J extrapolation with smaller statistical errors, and computational efficiency for challenging systems. However, cluster state truncation represents a fundamental limitation requiring careful convergence testing, particularly for large local cluster dimensions. We identify specific failure cases where current truncation schemes break down, highlighting the need for improved cluster state selection methods and distributed memory implementations to realize TPSCI's full potential for strongly correlated systems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13002'&gt;arXiv:2508.13002&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 18 Aug 2025 15:23:53 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Generalized Symmetries From Fusion Actions</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Chongying Dong, Siu-Hung Ng, Li Ren, Feng Xu&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Let $A$ be a condensable algebra in a modular tensor category $\mathcal{C}$. We define an action of the fusion category $\mathcal{C}_A$ of $A$-modules in $\mathcal{C}$ on the morphism space Hom$_{\mathcal{C}}(x,A)$ for any $x$ in $\mathcal{C}$, whose characters are generalized Frobenius-Schur indicators. This fusion action can be considered on $A$, and we prove a categorical generalization of Schur-Weyl duality for this action. For any fusion subcategory $\mathcal{B}$ of $\mathcal{C}_A$ containing all the local $A$-modules, we prove the invariant subobject $B=A^\mathcal{B}$ is a condensable subalgebra of $A$. The assignment of $\mathcal{B}$ to $A^\mathcal{B}$ defines a Galois correspondence between this kind of fusion subcategories of $\mathcal{C}_A$ and the condensable subalgebras of $A$. In the context of VOA, we prove for any nice VOAs $U \subset A$, $U=A^{\mathcal{C}_A}$ where $\mathcal{C}=\mathcal{M}_U$ is the $U$-module category. In particular, if $U = A^G$ for some finite automorphism group $G$ of $A,$ the fusion action of $\mathcal{C}_A$ on $A$ is equivalent to the $G$-action on $A.$&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13063'&gt;arXiv:2508.13063&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 18 Aug 2025 16:36:18 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>SO(n) Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki states as conformal boundary states of integrable SU(n) spin chains</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Yueshui Zhang, Ying-Hai Wu, Meng Cheng, Hong-Hao Tu&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We construct a class of conformal boundary states in the $\mathrm{SU}(n)_1$ Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) conformal field theory (CFT) using the symmetry embedding $\mathrm{Spin}(n)_2 \subset \mathrm{SU}(n)_1$. These boundary states are beyond the standard Cardy construction and possess $\mathrm{SO}(n)$ symmetry. The $\mathrm{SU}(n)$ Uimin-Lai-Sutherland (ULS) spin chains, which realize the $\mathrm{SU}(n)_1$ WZW model on the lattice, allow us to identify these boundary states as the ground states of the $\mathrm{SO}(n)$ Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki spin chains. Using the integrability of the $\mathrm{SU}(n)$ ULS model, we analytically compute the corresponding Affleck-Ludwig boundary entropy using exact overlap formulas. Our results unveil intriguing connections between exotic boundary states in CFT and integrable lattice models, thus providing deep insights into the interplay of symmetry, integrability, and boundary critical phenomena.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13114'&gt;arXiv:2508.13114&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 18 Aug 2025 17:20:23 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Autoregressive Typical Thermal States</title>

Melko&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; A variety of generative neural networks recently adopted from machine learning have provided promising strategies for studying quantum matter. In particular, the success of autoregressive models in natural language processing has motivated their use as variational ans\"atze, with the hope that their demonstrated ability to scale will transfer to simulations of quantum many-body systems. In this paper, we introduce an autoregressive framework to calculate finite-temperature properties of a quantum system based on the imaginary-time evolution of an ensemble of pure states. We find that established approaches based on minimally entangled typical thermal states (METTS) have numerical instabilities when an autoregressive recurrent neural network is used as the variational ans\"atz. We show that these instabilities can be mitigated by evolving the initial ensemble states with a unitary operation, along with applying a threshold to curb runaway evolution of ensemble members. By comparing our algorithm to exact results for the spin 1/2 quantum XY chain, we demonstrate that autoregressive typical thermal states are capable of accurately calculating thermal observables.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13455'&gt;arXiv:2508.13455&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 19 Aug 2025 02:20:15 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Real-time bubble nucleation and growth for false vacuum decay on the lattice</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Daan Maertens, Jutho Haegeman, Karel Van Acoleyen&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We revisit quantum false vacuum decay for the one-dimensional Ising model, focusing on the real-time nucleation and growth of true vacuum bubbles. Via matrix product state simulations, we demonstrate that for a wide range of parameters, the full time-dependent quantum state is well described by a Gaussian ansatz in terms of domain wall operators, with the associated vacuum bubble wave function evolving according to the linearized time-dependent variational principle. The emerging picture shows three different stages of evolution: an initial nucleation of small bubbles, followed by semi-classical bubble growth, which in turn is halted by the lattice phenomenon of Bloch oscillations. Furthermore, we find that the resonant bubble only plays a significant role in a certain region of parameter-space. However, when significant, it does lead to an approximately constant decay rate during the intermediate stage. Moreover, this rate is in quantitative agreement with the analytical result of Rutkevich (Phys. Rev. B 60, 14525) for which we provide an independent derivation based on the Gaussian ansatz.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13645'&gt;arXiv:2508.13645&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 19 Aug 2025 08:56:15 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Matrix Product Operator Constructions for Gauge Theories in the Thermodynamic Limit</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14145</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Nicholas Godfrey, Ian P. McCulloch&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We present a general method for simulating lattice gauge theories in low dimensions using infinite matrix product states (iMPS). A central challenge in Hamiltonian formulations of gauge theories is the unbounded local Hilbert space associated with gauge degrees of freedom. In one spatial dimension, Gauss's law permits these gauge fields to be integrated out, yielding an effective Hamiltonian with long-range interactions among matter fields. We construct efficient matrix product operator (MPO) representations of these Hamiltonians directly in the thermodynamic limit. Our formulation naturally includes background fields and $\theta$-terms, requiring no modifications to the standard iDMRG algorithm. This provides a broadly applicable framework for 1+1D gauge theories and can be extended to quasi-two-dimensional geometries such as infinite cylinders, where tensor-network methods remain tractable. As a benchmark, we apply our construction to the Schwinger model, reproducing expected features including confinement, string breaking, and the critical behavior at finite mass. Because the method alters only the MPO structure, it can be incorporated with little effort into a wide range of iMPS and infinite-boundary-condition algorithms, opening the way to efficient studies of both equilibrium and non-equilibrium gauge dynamics.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14145'&gt;arXiv:2508.14145&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 19 Aug 2025 16:34:16 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Reduced basis solvers for unfitted methods on parameterized domains</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15320</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Nicholas Mueller, Santiago Badia, Yiran Zhao&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; In this paper, we present a unified framework for reduced basis approximations of parametrized partial differential equations defined on parameter-dependent domains. Our approach combines unfitted finite element methods with both classical and tensor-based reduced basis techniques -- particularly the tensor-train reduced basis method -- to enable efficient and accurate model reduction on general geometries. To address the challenge of reconciling geometric variability with fixed-dimensional snapshot representations, we adopt a deformation-based strategy that maps a reference configuration to each parameterized domain. Furthermore, we introduce a localization procedure to construct dictionaries of reduced subspaces and hyper-reduction approximations, which are obtained via matrix discrete empirical interpolation in our work. We extend the proposed framework to saddle-point problems by adapting the supremizer enrichment strategy to unfitted methods and deformed configurations, demonstrating that the supremizer operator can be defined on the reference configuration without loss of stability. Numerical experiments on two- and three-dimensional problems -- including Poisson, linear elasticity, incompressible Stokes and Navier-Stokes equations -- demonstrate the flexibility, accuracy and efficiency of the proposed methodology.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15320'&gt;arXiv:2508.15320&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 21 Aug 2025 07:34:06 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Assessing the Reliability of Truncated Coupled Cluster Wavefunction: Estimating the Distance from the Exact Solution</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15681</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Ádám Ganyecz, Zsolt Benedek, Klára Petrov, Gergely Barcza, András Olasz, Miklós A. Werner, Örs Legeza&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; A new approach is proposed to assess the reliability of the truncated wavefunction methods by estimating the deviation from the full configuration interaction (FCI) wavefunction. While typical multireference diagnostics compare some derived property of the solution with the ideal picture of a single determinant, we try to answer a more practical question, how far is the solution from the exact one. Using the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) method to provide an approximate FCI solution for the self-consistently determined relevant active space, we compare the low-level CI expansions and one-body reduced density matrixes to determine the distance of the two solutions ($\tilde{d}_\Phi$, $\tilde{d}_\gamma$). We demonstrate the applicability of the approach for the CCSD method by benchmarking on the W4-17 dataset, as well as on transition metal-containing species. We also show that the presented moderate-cost, purely wavefunction-based metric is truly unique in the sense that it does not correlate with any popular multireference measures. We also explored the usage of CCSD natural orbitals ($\tilde{d}_{\gamma,\mathrm{NO}}$) and its effect on the active space size and the metric. The proposed diagnostic can also be applied to other wavefunction approximations, and it has the potential to provide a quality measure for post-Hartree-Fock procedures in general.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15681'&gt;arXiv:2508.15681&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 21 Aug 2025 16:02:12 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Evaluating classical simulations with a quantum processor</title>

King&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; As simulations of quantum systems cross the limits of classical computability, both quantum and classical approaches become hard to verify. Scaling predictions are therefore based on local structure and asymptotic assumptions, typically with classical methods being used to evaluate quantum simulators where possible. Here, in contrast, we use a quantum annealing processor to produce a ground truth for evaluating classical tensor-network methods whose scaling has not yet been firmly established. Our observations run contrary to previous scaling predictions, demonstrating the need for caution when extrapolating the accuracy of classical simulations of quantum dynamics. Our results demonstrate that the virtuous cycle of competition between classical and quantum simulations can lend insight in both directions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15759'&gt;arXiv:2508.15759&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 21 Aug 2025 17:55:53 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Statistics-encoded tensor network approach in disordered quantum many-body spin chains</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16286</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Hao Zhu, Ding-Zu Wang, Shi-Ju Ran, Guo-Feng Zhang&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Simulating the dynamics of quantum many-body systems with disorder is a fundamental challenge. In this work, we propose a general approach -- the statistics-encoded tensor network (SeTN) -- to study such systems. By encoding disorder into an auxiliary layer and averaging separately, SeTN restores translational invariance, enabling a well-defined transfer matrix formulation. We derive a universal criterion, $n \gg \alpha^2 t^2$, linking discretization $n$, disorder strength $\alpha$, and evolution duration $t$. This sets the resolution required for faithful disorder averaging and shows that encoding is most efficient in the weak-disorder, typically chaotic regime. Applied to the disordered transverse-field Ising model, SeTN shows that the spectral form factor is governed by the leading transfer-matrix eigenvalue, in contrast to the kicked Ising model. SeTN thus provides a novel framework for probing the disorder-driven dynamical phenomena in many-body quantum systems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16286'&gt;arXiv:2508.16286&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 22 Aug 2025 10:50:27 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

Søgaard&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We present a matrix product operator construction that allows us to represent the lattice Hamiltonians of (abelian or non-abelian) gauge theories in a local and manifestly translation-invariant form. In particular, we use symmetric matrix product states and introduce link-enhanced matrix product operators (LEMPOs) that can act on both the physical and virtual spaces of the matrix product states. This construction allows us to study Hamiltonian lattice gauge theories on infinite lattices. As examples, we show how to implement this method to study the massless and massive one-flavor Schwinger model and adjoint QCD$_2$.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16363'&gt;arXiv:2508.16363&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 22 Aug 2025 13:14:29 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Emergent statistical mechanics in holographic random tensor networks</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16570</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Shozab Qasim, Jens Eisert, Alexander Jahn&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Recent years have enjoyed substantial progress in capturing properties of complex quantum systems by means of random tensor networks (RTNs), which form ensembles of quantum states that depend only on the tensor network geometry and bond dimensions. Of particular interest are RTNs on hyperbolic geometries, with local tensors typically chosen from the unitary Haar measure, that model critical boundary states of holographic bulk-boundary dualities. In this work, we elevate static pictures of ensemble averages to a dynamical one, to show that RTN states exhibit equilibration of time-averaged operator expectation values under a highly generic class of Hamiltonians with non-degenerate spectra. We prove that RTN states generally equilibrate at large bond dimension and also in the scaling limit for three classes of geometries: Those of matrix product states, regular hyperbolic tilings, and single "black hole" tensors. Furthermore, we prove a hierarchy of equilibration between finite-dimensional instances of these classes for bulk and boundary states with small entanglement. This suggests an equivalent hierarchy between corresponding many-body phases, and reproduces a holographic degree-of-freedom counting for the effective dimension of each system. These results demonstrate that RTN techniques can probe aspects of late-time dynamics of quantum many-body phases and suggest a new approach to describing aspects of holographic dualities using techniques from statistical mechanics.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16570'&gt;arXiv:2508.16570&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 22 Aug 2025 17:49:49 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Hunting for superconductivity in doped triangular lattice Kitaev magnets</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16720</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Andrew Hardy, Ryan Levy, Arun Paramekanti&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Motivated by exploring correlated metals with frustrating bond-dependent exchange interactions, we study hole and electron doped Kitaev Mott insulators on the triangular lattice. Using homogeneous parton mean field theory, we find that the stripe antiferromagnetic (AFM) order for Kitaev coupling $K&gt;0$ and the ferromagnetic (FM) order for $K&lt;0$, both vanish at sufficiently large doping, beyond which we find regimes with chiral $d\pm i d$ singlet pairing and $p\pm ip$ triplet pairing respectively. Our tensor network computations however reveal that the superconducting correlations are strongly suppressed; while FM order stubbornly persists for the doped $K&lt;0$ model, the doped $K&gt;0$ model features emergent spin-charge modulated stripe orders. At higher hole doping for $K &gt; 0$, where AFM order is more strongly suppressed than for the electron doped case, incorporating a sufficiently strong nearest-neighbor attraction yields evidence for singlet $d$-wave superconductivity with Luttinger parameter $K_{\rm sc} &lt; 1$. Our work sets the stage for a broader exploration of doping effects in triangular lattice magnets such as NaRuO$_2$ which feature bond-dependent exchange interactions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16720'&gt;arXiv:2508.16720&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 22 Aug 2025 18:00:02 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Unitary network: Tensor network unitaries with local unitarity</title>

Compared to existing architectures, in a unitary network each local tensor is required to be a unitary matrix upon suitable reshaping. Global unitarity is ensured when the network obeys a suitable ordering property. Unitary operators represented by unitary networks need not preserve locality. In particular, we show that the class of unitary networks encompasses global unitaries which preserve locality up to exponentially suppressed tails, as in those that naturally arise from the finite-time evolution of local Hamiltonians. Non-invertible symmetries, as exemplified by the non-local Kramers-Wannier duality in one dimension, can also be represented using unitary networks. We also show that information flow in a unitary network can be characterized by a flow index, which matches the known index for quantum cellular automata as a special case.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16890'&gt;arXiv:2508.16890&lt;/a&gt;] Published Sat, 23 Aug 2025 03:35:29 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>The holographic entanglement pattern of BTZ planar black hole from a thread perspective</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Yi-Yu Lin, Dong-Yu Fang, Jie-Chen Jin, Chen-Ye Li&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; In this paper, we study the holographic quantum entanglement structure in the finite-temperature CFT state/planar BTZ black hole correspondence from the perspective of entanglement threads. Unlike previous studies based on bit threads, these entanglement threads provide a more detailed characterization of the contribution sources to the von Neumann entropy of boundary subregions, in particular by quantitatively deriving the flux function of entanglement threads that traverse the wormhole horizon and connect the two asymptotic boundaries. Since entanglement threads are naturally and closely related to tensor network states, the results are argued to imply the existence of the perfect-type entanglement formed jointly by the entanglement threads crossing the wormhole and the internal threads in the single-sided boundary. We also discuss the close connections of this work with concepts such as bit threads and partial entanglement entropy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16977'&gt;arXiv:2508.16977&lt;/a&gt;] Published Sat, 23 Aug 2025 10:02:44 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Spectral Functions of an Extended Antiferromagnetic $S=1/2$ Heisenberg Model on the Triangular Lattice</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17292</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Markus Drescher, Laurens Vanderstraeten, Roderich Moessner, Frank Pollmann&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We study an extended spin-$1/2$ antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model on the triangular lattice, which includes both nearest- and next-nearest-neighbor interactions, as well as a scalar chiral term. This model exhibits a rich phase diagram featuring several competing phases: different quantum spin liquids and various magnetically ordered states, including coplanar $120^\circ$ order, stripe order, and non-coplanar tetrahedral order. We employ large-scale matrix product state simulations optimized for GPUs to obtain high-resolution dynamical responses. Our calculations reveal the spectral features across both ordered and liquid regimes of the phase diagram, which we analyze in comparison with analytical predictions and field-theoretical approaches. We identify unique signatures of the ordered phases in the form of gapless Goldstone modes at the ordering wave vectors. Our results in the $J_1-J_2$ quantum spin-liquid regime are indicative of a $U(1)$ Dirac spin liquid. In the chiral spin-liquid phase, we find signatures of spinons as the fractional excitations of the underlying theory, manifested as the onset of a two-spinon continuum that agrees with predictions from the Kalmeyer-Laughlin ansatz for the ground-state wave function, and collective modes that can be viewed as spinon bound states. We discuss finite-size effects, their consistency with the presumptions from field-theory, and review the dynamical structure factor with regard to experimentally relevant features such as the occurrence of highly dispersive signals and the global distribution of spectral weight.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17292'&gt;arXiv:2508.17292&lt;/a&gt;] Published Sun, 24 Aug 2025 10:36:52 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Succession of Ising criticality and its threshold in critical quantum Ising model subject to symmetric decoherence</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17871</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Yoshihito Kuno, Takahiro Orito, Ikuo Ichinose&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We investigate a mixed state quantum criticality in the Ising model under $X+ZZ$ decoherence. In the doubled Hilbert space formalism, the decohered state resides on the self-dual critical line of the quantum Ashkin-Teller (qAT) model, as a result of the specific choice of the decoherence channel. On the other hand, since the mixed state under $X+ZZ$ decoherence satisfies the Kramers-Wannier self-duality in a weak sense, the Ising criticality of the pure state can be partially preserved in the mixed system. By making use of the combination of the doubled Hilbert space formalism and matrix product states, we carry out extensive numerical study to elucidate the mixed state criticality. We find that under decoherence up to moderate strength, the mixed states on the critical line have properties of the Ising CFT, where $c=1/2$, $\eta=0.25$ and, $\nu=1$. These values of the central charge and critical exponents contrast with the ones in the $c=1$ orbifold boson CFT describing the critical state of the qAT model. In addition, we also observe the threshold of the mixed Ising CFT. The strong decoherence washes out the remnant Ising criticality and induces strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17871'&gt;arXiv:2508.17871&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 25 Aug 2025 10:26:13 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>The holographic dual of the GHZ state</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17898</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Libo Jiang, Yan Liu&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Current holographic research mostly focuses on a subset of quantum systems with a classical gravity dual. Although the precise boundary of this subset remains unknown, certain constraints are recognized; for instance, holographic entropies obey inequalities that are violated by general quantum states such as the GHZ states. This paper, however, presents a gravity dual for GHZ states -- a non-ordinary geometry termed the booklet wormhole. We demonstrate an exact match for all entropy properties with the GHZ state, as well as the identity of the Euclidean partition functions for both systems. The booklet wormhole circumvents the conventional holographic entropy inequalities because different topologies are inevitably included in the gravitational path integral, even in the large-$N$ limit. This provides the first explicit holographic duality with a non-perturbative quantum effect. Remarkably, the construction is simple and maximally entangled, making it ideal for gedanken experiments.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17898'&gt;arXiv:2508.17898&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 25 Aug 2025 11:12:08 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Low-Rank Tensor Decompositions for the Theory of Neural Networks</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18408</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Ricardo Borsoi, Konstantin Usevich, Marianne Clausel&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The groundbreaking performance of deep neural networks (NNs) promoted a surge of interest in providing a mathematical basis to deep learning theory. Low-rank tensor decompositions are specially befitting for this task due to their close connection to NNs and their rich theoretical results. Different tensor decompositions have strong uniqueness guarantees, which allow for a direct interpretation of their factors, and polynomial time algorithms have been proposed to compute them. Through the connections between tensors and NNs, such results supported many important advances in the theory of NNs. In this review, we show how low-rank tensor methods--which have been a core tool in the signal processing and machine learning communities--play a fundamental role in theoretically explaining different aspects of the performance of deep NNs, including their expressivity, algorithmic learnability and computational hardness, generalization, and identifiability. Our goal is to give an accessible overview of existing approaches (developed by different communities, ranging from computer science to mathematics) in a coherent and unified way, and to open a broader perspective on the use of low-rank tensor decompositions for the theory of deep NNs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18408'&gt;arXiv:2508.18408&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 25 Aug 2025 18:50:45 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

Our Chain Expansion (ChE) method maps each SC lead onto a finite tight-binding chain with parameters obtained from Pad\'e approximants of the tunneling self-energy. We provide an explicit algorithm for the general case as well as simple analytical expressions for the chain parameters in the wide-band and infinite-chain limits. This mapping preserves low-energy physics while enabling efficient simulations: short chains are tractable with exact diagonalization, and longer ones with density matrix renormalization group methods. The approach remains reliable and computationally efficient across diverse geometries, both in and out of equilibrium. We use ChE to map the ground-state phase diagrams of double, triple, and quadruple quantum dots coupled to a single SC lead. While half-filled symmetric systems show similar overall diagrams, the particular phases differ substantially with dot number. Here, large parameter regions are entirely missed by the widely used zero-bandwidth approximation but are captured by ChE. Away from half-filling, additional dots markedly increase diagram complexity, producing a rich variety of stable phases. These results demonstrate ChE as a fast, accurate, and systematically improvable tool for exploring complex SC nanostructures.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18465'&gt;arXiv:2508.18465&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 25 Aug 2025 20:33:35 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Tunneling spectroscopy of the spinon-Kondo effect in one-dimensional Mott insulators</title>

Marquez, Karen Hallberg, Tim Bauer, Reinhold Egger&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We study the tunneling density of states (TDOS) in one-dimensional Mott insulators at energies below the charge gap. By employing nonlinear Luttinger liquid theory and density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations, we predict that in the presence of a magnetic impurity at the boundary, characteristic Fermi-edge singularity features can appear at subgap energies in the TDOS near the boundary. In contrast to the Kondo effect in a metal, these resonances are strongly asymmetric and of power-law form. The power-law exponent is universal and determined by the spinon-Kondo effect.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19084'&gt;arXiv:2508.19084&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 26 Aug 2025 14:46:30 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics in a split Hilbert space: Quantum impurity at the edge of the Heisenberg chain</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19334</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Abay Zhakenov, Pradip Kattel, Natan Andrei&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We study the isotropic spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ Heisenberg chain with a single edge-coupled impurity of arbitrary exchange strength $J$. The model exhibits four impurity phases. For antiferromagnetic couplings ($J&gt;0$): a \textit{Kondo phase} at weak $J$, where the impurity is screened by many-body excitations and the impurity entropy decreases monotonically from $\ln 2$ at $T \to \infty$ to $0$ at $T\to 0$; and an \textit{antiferromagnetic bound-mode (ABM) phase} at strong $J$, where the impurity screened by an exponentially localized bound mode drives $S_{\mathrm{imp}}(T)$ nonmonotonically, with undershoots below zero at intermediate temperatures, while tending to $\ln 2$ as $T \to \infty$ and to $0$ as $T \to 0$. For ferromagnetic couplings ($J&lt;0$): a local-moment (LM) phase at weak $|J|$, where the impurity remains unscreened with $S_{\mathrm{imp}}\to \ln 2$ as $T \to 0$ but exhibits shallow undershoots at intermediate scales; and a \textit{ferromagnetic bound-mode (FBM) phase} at strong $|J|$, where $S_{\mathrm{imp}}=\ln 2$ in both UV and IR limits, yet develops an intermediate-temperature undershoot. We provide an analytic understanding of this behavior, showing that the undershoots originate from the fractionalization of the Hilbert space into several towers of states: for antiferromagnetic couplings this occurs only at strong $J$, driven by boundary-localized bound modes, while for ferromagnetic couplings undershoots occur for all $J&lt;0$, becoming deeper with increasing $|J|$ and vanishing as $J\to 0^{-}$. These bound modes screen the impurity. Incorporating the bound modes and edge states provides a complete analytic understanding of this phenomenon and yields closed expressions for the impurity contribution to free energy and entropy that are valid across all phases. These are checked and found to be in excellent agreement with tensor network and exact diagonalization results.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19334'&gt;arXiv:2508.19334&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 26 Aug 2025 18:00:02 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Riccarda Bonsignori, Viktor Eisler&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We investigate the dynamics of the entanglement Hamiltonian in a system of one-dimensional free fermions, following a local joining quench of two initially disconnected half-chains in their ground states. Applying techniques of conformal field theory, we obtain a local expression where the left- and right-moving components of the energy density are associated with different weight functions. The results are then compared to numerical calculations for the hopping chain, which requires to consider a proper continuum limit of the lattice entanglement Hamiltonian, obtaining a good agreement with the field-theory prediction.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19406'&gt;arXiv:2508.19406&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 26 Aug 2025 20:03:02 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Numerical Optimization for Tensor Disentanglement</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Julia Wei, Alec Dektor, Chungen Shen, Zaiwen Wen, Chao Yang&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Tensor networks provide compact and scalable representations of high-dimensional data, enabling efficient computation in fields such as quantum physics, numerical partial differential equations (PDEs), and machine learning. This paper focuses on tensor disentangling, the task of identifying transformations that reduce bond dimensions by exploiting gauge freedom in the network. We formulate this task as an optimization problem over orthogonal matrices acting on a single tensor's indices, aiming to minimize the rank of its matricized form. We present Riemannian optimization methods and a joint optimization framework that alternates between optimizing the orthogonal transformation for a fixed low-rank approximation and optimizing the low-rank approximation for a fixed orthogonal transformation, offering a competitive alternative when the target rank is known. To seek the often unknown optimal rank, we introduce a binary search strategy integrated with the disentangling procedure. Numerical experiments on random tensors and tensors in an approximate isometric tensor network state are performed to compare different optimization methods and explore the possibility of combining different methods in a hybrid approach.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19409'&gt;arXiv:2508.19409&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 26 Aug 2025 20:17:48 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Direct probing of the simulation complexity of open quantum many-body dynamics</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Lucia Vilchez-Estevez, Alexander Yosifov, Jinzhao Sun&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Simulating open quantum systems is key to understanding non-equilibrium processes, as persistent influence from the environment induces dissipation and can give rise to steady-state phase transitions. A common strategy is to embed the system-environment into a larger unitary framework, but this obscures the intrinsic complexity of the reduced system dynamics. Here, we investigate the computational complexity of simulating open quantum systems, focusing on two physically relevant parameters, correlation length and mixing time, and explore whether it can be comparable (or even lower) to that of simulating their closed counterparts. In particular, we study the role of dissipation in simulating open-system dynamics using both quantum and classical methods, where the classical complexity is characterised by the bond dimension and operator entanglement entropy. Our results show that dissipation affects correlation length and mixing time in distinct ways at intermediate and long timescales. Moreover, we observe numerically that in classical tensor network simulations, classical complexity does not decrease with stronger dissipation, revealing a separation between quantum and classical resource scaling.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19959'&gt;arXiv:2508.19959&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 27 Aug 2025 15:14:36 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Near-optimal decomposition of unitary matrices using phase masks and the discrete Fourier transform</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20010</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Vincent Girouard, Nicolás Quesada&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Universal multiport interferometers (UMIs) have emerged as a key tool for performing arbitrary linear transformations on optical modes, enabling precise control over the state of light in essential applications of classical and quantum information processing such as neural networks and boson sampling. While UMI architectures based on Mach-Zehnder interferometer networks are well established, alternative approaches that involve interleaving fixed multichannel mixing layers and phase masks have recently gained interest due to their high robustness to losses and fabrication errors. However, these approaches currently lack optimal analytical methods to compute design parameters with low optical depth. In this work, we introduce a constructive decomposition of unitary matrices using a sequence of $2N+5$ phase masks interleaved with $2N+4$ discrete Fourier transform matrices. This decomposition can be leveraged to design universal interferometers based on phase masks and multimode interference couplers, implementing a discrete Fourier transform, offering an analytical alternative to conventional numerical optimization-based designs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20010'&gt;arXiv:2508.20010&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 27 Aug 2025 16:13:34 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Classical fractional time series from quantum XXZ spin chains</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Zoltán Udvarnoki, Gábor Fáth, Miklós Werner, Örs Legeza&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Entangled quantum mechanical states in one dimension can be used to represent and simulate classical stochastic processes with nontrivial statistical properties. Long-range quantum correlations translate into fractional processes with their asymptotic Hurst exponents characterizing roughness and persistence. We explore this analogy in the case of the spin-1/2 XXZ chain and investigate properties of four different classical two-state processes that this quantum system can generate. These processes show fractional characteristics with varying Hurst exponents. We argue that the continuous quantum symmetries such as U(1) or SU(2) of the XXZ chain give rise to $H=0$ with logarithmic scaling. Processes generated without these symmetries can produce $H \geq0.5$ but likely not $H &lt; 0.5$ unless the dominant term responsible for $H=0.5$ gets canceled. This does not seem to happen for the XXZ model. We use standard quantum methods, including MERA and TEBD, to numerically substantiate our findings.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20974'&gt;arXiv:2508.20974&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 28 Aug 2025 16:27:11 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Evolution of quasiparticle edge states with Hubbard interaction in Rice-Mele chain</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Jyoti Bisht, Brijesh Kumar&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We study the behaviour of edge states in Rice-Mele model with Hubbard interaction, U , at half-filling using density matrix renormalization group, exact diagonalization and effective charge dynamics in Kumar representation. For a fixed dimerization, $\delta$, and staggered potential, V , we find by increasing U the quasiparticle edge states in the charge gap to come down in energy from V in the absence of Hubbard interaction to zero energy for U $\approx$ 2V . This presents an uncommon case where repulsion leads to zero-energy edge states. Upon increasing U further, the edge state energy starts increasing again until they are lost in the bulk. However, upon increasing U even further, these edge states reappear in the high energy gap. So, with Hubbard interaction, the edge states in Rice-Mele chain transmigrate from the physical charge gap to a high energy gap.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21008'&gt;arXiv:2508.21008&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 28 Aug 2025 17:09:44 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Classical Simulations of Low Magic Quantum Dynamics</title>

Pixley&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We develop classical simulation algorithms for adaptive quantum circuits that produce states with low levels of ``magic'' (i.e., non-stabilizerness). These algorithms are particularly well-suited to circuits with high rates of Pauli measurements, such as those encountered in quantum error correction and monitored quantum circuits. The measurements serve to limit the buildup of magic induced by non-Clifford operations arising from generic noise processes or unitary gates, respectively. Our algorithms also allow a systematic truncation procedure to achieve approximate simulation. To benchmark our approach, we study the dynamics of all-to-all monitored quantum circuits with a sub-extensive rate of $T$-gates per unit of circuit depth, where we can simulate previously inaccessible system sizes and depths. We characterize measurement-induced phase transitions in the output wavefunction, including in the entanglement, purification, and magic. We outline the utility of our algorithms to simulate dynamics with low magic and high entanglement, complementary to the leading matrix-product state approaches.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20252'&gt;arXiv:2508.20252&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 27 Aug 2025 20:17:15 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

Our approach is tailored for digital quantum computers with restricted qubit connectivity, a common limitation in state-of-the-art hardware platforms. We examine two configurations: star connectivity, which enables rotationally invariant entanglement, and linear connectivity, which achieves translationally invariant entanglement. For the linear configuration, we use a variant of the time-dependent density matrix renormalization group (tDMRG) algorithm to demonstrate that our protocol is independent of the qubits' number. A slight modification of the protocol reveals the presence of quantum states that exhibit periodicity of entanglement among nearest-neighbor qubits. The configurations and protocols of this work are well-suited for near-term quantum devices, offering a feasible route for the experimental realization of symmetric entangled states.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20770'&gt;arXiv:2508.20770&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 28 Aug 2025 13:26:13 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

This factor sharing introduces additional challenges, as it breaks the multilinear structure of the decomposition. Nevertheless, we show that Riemannian optimization methods can naturally handle such constraints and prove that the underlying manifold is indeed smooth. We develop efficient algorithms for key Riemannian optimization components, including a retraction operation based on quasi-optimal approximation in the new format, as well as tangent space projection using automatic differentiation. Finally, we demonstrate the practical effectiveness of our approach through tensor approximation tasks and multidimensional eigenvalue problem.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20928'&gt;arXiv:2508.20928&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 28 Aug 2025 15:56:14 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

These rules form a term rewriting system, a formal method for deriving equivalences by repeatedly applying substitutions. We construct an efficiently implementable quantum Hamiltonian whose ground state encodes the entire class of equivalent expressions - potentially exponentially many - in a quantum superposition. By preparing and manipulating these ground states, we address fundamental problems in equational reasoning, including the word problem, i.e., determining whether two expressions are equivalent, counting the number of equivalent expressions, and identifying structural properties of equivalence classes. We demonstrate a quantum-inspired version of the algorithm using tensor network simulations by solving instances involving up to $10^{28}$ equivalent expressions, well beyond the reach of standard classical graph exploration techniques. This framework opens the path for quantum symbolic computation in areas ranging from quantum and logical circuit design to data compression, computational group theory, linguistics, polymers and biomolecular modeling, enabling the investigation of problems previously out of reach.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21122'&gt;arXiv:2508.21122&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 28 Aug 2025 18:00:06 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Nonperturbative Semiclassical Spin Dynamics for Ordered Quantum Magnets</title>

Batista&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; In ordered quantum magnets where interactions between elementary excitations dominate over their kinetic energy, perturbative approaches often fail, making non-perturbative methods essential to capture spectral features such as bound states and the redistribution of weight within excitation continua. Although an increasing number of experiments report anomalous spin excitation continua in such systems, their microscopic interpretation remains an open challenge. Here, we investigate the spin dynamics of the triangular-lattice antiferromagnet in its 1/3-plateau phase using two complementary non-perturbative approaches: exact diagonalization in a truncated Hilbert space for a gas of elementary excitations (THED) and matrix product state (MPS) simulations. Alongside cross-validation between these methods, we benchmark our results against inelastic neutron scattering (INS) data. The THED analysis confirms the presence of two-magnon bound states and identifies the anomalous scattering continuum observed in both MPS and INS as a two-magnon resonance, arising from hybridization between the bound state and the two-magnon continuum. Furthermore, THED reveals bound states overlapping with the continuum, enriching the interpretation of continuum anomalies. More broadly, THED provides a robust framework for investigating anomalous spin excitation continua and bound-state effects in other materials with gapped spectra. Its combination of accuracy and computational efficiency makes it a powerful tool for extracting reliable microscopic models in semiclassical regimes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21142'&gt;arXiv:2508.21142&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 28 Aug 2025 18:18:23 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning for Optimizing Large Qubit Array based Quantum Sensor Circuits</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21253</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Laxmisha Ashok Attisara, Sathish Kumar&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; As the number of qubits in a sensor increases, the complexity of designing and controlling the quantum circuits grows exponentially. Manually optimizing these circuits becomes infeasible. Optimizing entanglement distribution in large-scale quantum circuits is critical for enhancing the sensitivity and efficiency of quantum sensors [5], [6]. This paper presents an engineering integration of reinforcement learning with tensor-network-based simulation (MPS) for scalable circuit optimization for optimizing quantum sensor circuits with up to 60 qubits. To enable efficient simulation and scalability, we adopt tensor network methods, specifically the Matrix Product State (MPS) representation, instead of traditional state vector or density matrix approaches. Our reinforcement learning agent learns to restructure circuits to maximize Quantum Fisher Information (QFI) and entanglement entropy while reducing gate counts and circuit depth. Experimental results show consistent improvements, with QFI values approaching 1, entanglement entropy in the 0.8-1.0 range, and up to 90% reduction in depth and gate count. These results highlight the potential of combining quantum machine learning and tensor networks to optimize complex quantum circuits under realistic constraints.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21253'&gt;arXiv:2508.21253&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 28 Aug 2025 22:51:28 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Determination of ground states of one-dimensional quantum systems using the cluster iTEBD method</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21405</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Tao Yang, Rui Wang, Z. Y. Xie, Baigeng Wang&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Within the framework of imaginary-time evolution for matrix product states, we introduce a cluster version of the infinite time-evolving block decimation algorithm for simulating quantum many-body systems, addressing the computational accuracy challenges in strongly correlated physics. By redefining the wave-function ansatz to incorporate multiple physical degrees of freedom, we enhance the representation of entanglement, thereby improving the accuracy of the ground states. Utilizing the Trotter-Suzuki decomposition and optimized truncation schemes, our method maintains roughly the same computational complexity while capturing more quantum correlations. We apply this approach to three nontrivial cases: the gapless spin-1/2 Heisenberg chain, the spin-1 anisotropic XXZD chain with a higher-order Gaussian-type phase transition, and a spin-1/2 twisted triangular prism hosting a magnetic plateau phase. Improved accuracy in physical quantities, such as magnetization, ground-state energy, and entanglement entropy, has been demonstrated. This method provides a scalable framework for studying complex quantum systems with high precision, making it suitable for situations where a pure increase in bond dimension alone cannot guarantee satisfactory results.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21405'&gt;arXiv:2508.21405&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 29 Aug 2025 08:22:53 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Y. del Castillo, A. Ferrón, J. Fernández-Rossier&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We consider the remote manipulation of the quantum state of the edge fractional spins of Haldane spin chains using a weak local perturbation on the other edge. We derive an effective four-level model that correctly captures the response of the local magnetization to local perturbations and we use it to show that applying a small local field on one edge of the chain induces a strong variation of the magnetization on the opposite edge. Using a Landau-Zener protocol, we show how local control of the field on one edge of the chain, implemented for instance with a spin-polarized scanning tunnel microscope tip, can adiabatically switch the magnetization direction on the other side of the chain.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21544'&gt;arXiv:2508.21544&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 29 Aug 2025 11:56:22 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Polynomial complexity of open quantum system problems</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00424</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Chong Chen, Ren-Bao Liu&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Open quantum systems (OQS's) are ubiquitous in non-equilibrium quantum dynamics and in quantum science and technology. Solving the dynamics of an OQS in a quantum many-body bath has been considered a computationally hard problem because of the dimensionality curse. Here, considering that full knowledge of the bath dynamics is unnecessary for describing the reduced dynamics of an OQS, we prove a polynomial complexity theorem, that is, the number of independent equations required to fully describe the dynamics of an OQS increases at most linearly with the evolution time and polynomially with the bath size. Therefore, efficient computational algorithms exist for solving the dynamics of a small-sized OQS (such as a qubit or an atom). We further prove that, when the dynamics of an OQS and the bath is represented by a tensor network, a tensor contraction procedure can be specified such that the bond dimension (i.e., the range of tensor indices contracted in each step) increases only linearly (rather than exponentially) with the evolution time, providing explicitly efficient algorithms for a wide range of OQS's. We demonstrate the theorems and the tensor-network algorithm by solving two widely encountered OQS problems, namely, a spin in a Gaussian bath (the spin-boson model) and a central spin coupled to many environmental spins (the Gaudin model). This work provides approaches to understanding dynamics of OQS's, learning the environments via quantum sensors, and optimizing quantum information processing in noisy environments.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00424'&gt;arXiv:2509.00424&lt;/a&gt;] Published Sat, 30 Aug 2025 09:12:37 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>A Further Comparison of TD-DMRG and ML-MCTDH for Nonadiabatic Dynamics of Exciton Dissociation</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00456</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Weitang Li, Jiajun Ren, Jun Yan&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Tensor network methods, such as time-dependent density matrix renormalization group (TD-DMRG) and multi-layer multiconfiguration time-dependent Hartree (ML-MCTDH), are powerful tools for simulating quantum dynamics. While both methods are theoretically exact in the limit of large bond dimensions, a recent study reported up to 60% discrepancy in their calculations for exciton dissociation. To resolve this inconsistency, we conduct a systematic comparison using Renormalizer, a unified software framework for matrix product states (MPS) and tree tensor network states (TTNS). By revisiting the benchmark P3HT:PCBM heterojunction model, we show that the observed discrepancies arise primarily from insufficient bond dimensions. By increasing bond dimensions, we first reduce the difference to less than 10%. Further refinement using an extrapolation scheme and an optimized tensor network structure lowers the difference to approximately 2%. Our results confirm both methods converge to numerically exact solutions when bond dimensions are adequately scaled. This work not only validates the reliability of both methods but also provides high-accuracy benchmark data for future developments in quantum dynamics simulations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00456'&gt;arXiv:2509.00456&lt;/a&gt;] Published Sat, 30 Aug 2025 10:53:51 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Electronic frictional effects near metal surfaces with strong correlations</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00682</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Yunhao Liu, Wenjie Dou&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The electronic friction-Langevin dynamics (EF-LD) offers a simplified framework for describing nonadiabatic effects at metal surfaces, particularly in electrochemical and molecular electronic applications. We investigate the electronic friction behavior for the Hubbard-Holstein model using density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) theory. We show that electron-electron interactions lead to the formation of two energy levels in the impurity, resulting in two peaks in the electronic friction at the resonances of electron attachment or detachment with the metal's Fermi level. We further benchmark our results against mean field theory (MFT) and exact diagonalization (ED). The results calculated by ED and DMRG show strong agreement at high temperatures, suggesting the results from DMRG are reliable; however, at low temperatures, ED exhibits significant deviations relative to DMRG due to the finite-size limitations inherent in ED calculations. MFT completely fails to recover Fermi resonance in electronic friction. Moreover, we investigate the dynamics of the electronic friction using EF-LD. Simulations reveal differences between the electronic population and kinetic energy dynamics predicted by MFT and DMRG approaches, suggesting that MFT approach is unreliable for nonadiabatic dynamics of strongly correlated systems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00682'&gt;arXiv:2509.00682&lt;/a&gt;] Published Sun, 31 Aug 2025 03:37:01 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>An Inexact Low-Rank Source Iteration for Steady-State Radiative Transfer Equation with Diffusion Synthetic Acceleration</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00805</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Wei Guo, Zhichao Peng&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We propose an inexact low-rank source iteration with diffusion synthetic acceleration (SI-DSA) for solving the multidimensional steady-state radiative transfer equation (RTE) in the second-order formulation. The angular flux is represented in either a low-rank matrix or hierarchical Tucker tensor (HTT) format, enabling substantial reductions in computational resources. Each SI step is solved using a preconditioned low-rank conjugate gradient (CG) method with a diffusion preconditioner. To further improve efficiency, we introduce an adaptive inexact strategy that dynamically relaxes the inner CG tolerance during early SI iterations. The method exploits the tensor-product structure of the discretized operators to perform all matrix-vector operations in low-rank form. Numerical experiments on 2D2V benchmark problems, including diffusion-dominated, transport-dominated, and multiscale problems, demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves errors on the order of $10^{-4}$ to $10^{-5}$ relative to full-rank reference solutions, while reducing the degrees of freedom by up to two orders of magnitude. In the diffusion-dominated case, the low-rank solver achieves speedups exceeding $90\times$ over its full-rank counterpart and remains competitive in solving challenging transport-dominated and multiscale problems while providing substantial storage savings. To our knowledge, this work provides the first low-rank SI-DSA framework for multidimensional steady-state RTE.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00805'&gt;arXiv:2509.00805&lt;/a&gt;] Published Sun, 31 Aug 2025 11:35:56 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Tensor renormalization group approach to entanglement entropy</title>

The reduced density matrix of a $d$-dimensional quantum system is represented as a $(d+1)$-dimensional tensor network. We develop an explicit algorithm for $d=1$ that enables the calculation of EE for single-interval subsystems of arbitrary size. We test our method in two-dimensional tensor network of the Ising model. The central charge is obtained as $c=0.49997(8)$ for $D=96$, which agrees with the theoretical prediction within an error, demonstrating the accuracy and reliability of our proposed method.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02185'&gt;arXiv:2509.02185&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 02 Sep 2025 10:48:21 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Probing Non-Fermi-Liquid Behaviour of Composite Fermi Liquid via Efficient Thermal Simulations</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02218</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Bin-Bin Chen, Hongyu Lu, Zi Yang Meng&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The two-dimensional electron gas in a perpendicular magnetic field, i.e., the quantum Hall system, is remarkably rich. At half filling of the lowest Landau level, it has been predicted that ``composite fermions'' -- emergent quasiparticle of an electron with two magnetic flux quanta -- can experience zero net magnetic field and form a Fermi sea, dubbed composite Fermi liquid (CFL). However, the seemingly simple appearance of CFL is a strongly correlated quantum many-body state in disguise, and to solve it in a controlled manner is extremely difficult, to the level that the thermodynamic properties of CFL is still largely unknown. In this work, we perform state-of-the-art thermal tensor network simulations on the $\nu=1/2$ Landau level systems, and observe low-temperature power-law behaviour of the specific heat, signaling the gapless nature of CFL. More importantly, the power is extracted to be closed to $2/3$, clearly deviated from the ordinary linear-$T$ Fermi liquid behaviour, suggesting the coupling between the CFs and the dynamical emergent gauge field and therefore revealed the quantum many-body aspect of the CFL state. Relevance of our methodology to other quantum Hall settings and moir\'e systems is discussed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02218'&gt;arXiv:2509.02218&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 02 Sep 2025 11:39:17 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Fermion Discretization Effects in the Two-Flavor Lattice Schwinger Model: A Study with Matrix Product States</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02329</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Tim Schwägerl, Karl Jansen, Stefan Kühn&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We present a comprehensive tensor network study of staggered, Wilson, and twisted mass fermions in the Hamiltonian formulation, using the massive two-flavor Schwinger model as a benchmark. Particular emphasis is placed on twisted mass fermions, whose properties in this context have not been systematically explored before. We confirm the expected O(a) improvement in the free theory and observe that this improvement persists in the interacting case. By leveraging an electric-field-based method for mass renormalization, we reliably tune to maximal twist and establish the method's applicability in the two-flavor model. Once mass renormalization is included, the pion mass exhibits rapid convergence to the continuum limit. Finite-volume effects are addressed using two complementary approaches: dispersion relation fits and finite-volume scaling. Our results show excellent agreement with semiclassical predictions and reveal a milder volume dependence for twisted mass fermions compared to staggered and Wilson discretizations. In addition, we observe clear isospin-breaking effects, suggesting intriguing parallels with lattice QCD. These findings highlight the advantages of twisted mass fermions for Hamiltonian simulations and motivate their further exploration, particularly in view of future applications to higher-dimensional lattice gauge theories.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02329'&gt;arXiv:2509.02329&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 02 Sep 2025 13:58:48 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Semi-Dirac spin liquids and frustrated quantum magnetism on the trellis lattice</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Sourin Chatterjee, Atanu Maity, Janik Potten, Tobias Müller, Andreas Feuerpfeil, Ronny Thomale, Karlo Penc, Harald O. Jeschke, Rhine Samajdar, Yasir Iqbal&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Geometrical frustration in quantum magnets provides a fertile setting for unconventional phases of matter, including quantum spin liquids (QSLs). The trellis lattice, with its complex site arrangements and edge-sharing triangular motifs, presents a promising platform for such physics. In this work, we undertake a comprehensive classification of all fully symmetric QSLs on the trellis lattice using the projective symmetry group approach within the Abrikosov fermion representation. We find 7 U(1) and 25 $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ short-ranged $\textit{Ans\"atze}$, uncovering both gapped and Dirac QSLs as well as a novel semi-Dirac spin liquid, in which the spinon dispersion is linear along one momentum direction but quadratic along the orthogonal one. We demonstrate that such dispersions can occur only at high-symmetry points in the Brillouin zone with $C_{2v}$ little groups and analyze their characteristic correlation signatures. Moreover, by optimizing over all mean-field states, we map out a phase diagram -- featuring six distinct phases -- of the nearest-neighbor Heisenberg Hamiltonian on the trellis lattice. Going beyond mean field, we also assess equal-time and dynamical spin structure factors of these phases using density-matrix renormalization group and Keldysh pseudofermion functional renormalization group calculations. Finally, we identify four cuprate and vanadate compounds as promising experimental realizations and provide spectroscopic predictions, based on first-principles Hamiltonians, as a guide for future neutron-scattering studies on these materials.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02663'&gt;arXiv:2509.02663&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 02 Sep 2025 18:00:00 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Doping a spin-one Mott insulator: possible application to bilayer nickelate</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02673</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Hanbit Oh, Hui Yang, Ya-Hui Zhang&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; In this article, we review some recent theoretical developments on potential high-temperature superconductors and unconventional metallic states that can arise from doping a spin-one Mott insulator in the $d^{8}$ valence. These studies are particularly relevant-though not limited-to the recently discovered bilayer nickelate superconductor La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$. We focus on a ferromagnetic (FM) Kondo lattice model with mobile electrons in the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital coupled to the localized spin moments in $d_{z^2}$ orbital through a large Hund's coupling $J_H$. In the large $J_H$ limit, the model reduces to the type II t-J model with a mixture of spin-half singlon states and spin-one doublon states. We summarize DMRG results on the Luther-Emery liquid in one dimensional chain and two-leg ladder. Then we mainly focus on bilayer square lattice and show that a large inter-layer coupling $J_\perp$ of $d_{z^2}$ orbital can induce strong inter-layer pairing of $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital. In the strong $J_\perp$ limit, a kinetic-energy driven high $T_c$ superconductivity is demonstrated in an ideal model with only a single hopping term. Furthermore, the model predicts a symmetric pseudogap metal-dubbed `second Fermi liquid"-in the underdoped regime, yielding a phase diagram analogous to that of hole-doped cuprates. The bilayer Kondo model therefore, presents a promising platform for both realizing higher-Tc superconductors and exploring non-Fermi liquid physics. We also comment on the possible limitations of the current models for the bilayer nickelate material and point out some future directions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02673'&gt;arXiv:2509.02673&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 02 Sep 2025 18:00:01 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Robust superconductivity upon doping chiral spin liquid and Chern insulators in a Hubbard-Hofstadter model</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Clemens Kuhlenkamp, Stefan Divic, Michael P. Zaletel, Tomohiro Soejima, Ashvin Vishwanath&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Demonstrating superconductivity in purely repulsive Hubbard models is a compelling goal which underscores the counter-intuitive ability of Coulomb interactions to mediate superconductivity. Here, we present numerical evidence for robust superconductivity in a triangular Hubbard-Hofstadter model at $\pi/2$ flux per plaquette. Employing infinite density matrix renormalization group calculations on infinite cylinders of finite circumference, we observe superconducting ground states for a wide range of dopings, whose pair-correlations strengthen as the 2D limit is approached. At a density of one electron per site, Hubbard interactions have been reported to drive the insulating parent state of the superconductor from an integer quantum Hall (IQH) state to a chiral spin liquid (CSL). Our findings give credence to a recent proposal that proximity to the IQH-CSL transition serves to make chiral superconductivity energetically favorable on doping, and also correctly predicts the nature of the edge modes in the superconductor. On the CSL side, this suggests the superconductor can be thought of as arising from Laughlin's `anyon superconductivity' mechanism. Thus the Hubbard-Hofstadter model studied here offers a clean and experimentally accessible setup, potentially realizable in moir\'e heterostructures, for exploring the properties of anyonic matter at finite density and the interplay of topological order, quantum criticality and superconductivity.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02675'&gt;arXiv:2509.02675&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 02 Sep 2025 18:00:01 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

In the ordered phase, the spectrum contains a ladder of bound states and intertwined scattering resonances, which enable various scattering channels. By preparing wave packets on a $24 \times 24$ lattice and evolving the state with tensor networks, we explore and characterize these regimes, ranging from elastic scattering in the perturbative regime, to non-perturbative processes closer to the critical point. Then, we break the spin inversion symmetry and study the stability of the metastable false vacuum state on the collision of its excitations. We find that a highly-energetic scattering process can induce a violent decay of the false vacuum, and investigate the spread of the resulting true vacuum bubble.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02702'&gt;arXiv:2509.02702&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 02 Sep 2025 18:02:51 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

We study the lightly doped Hofstadter-Hubbard model on a triangular lattice through large-scale density matrix renormalization group and determinantal quantum Monte Carlo simulations. We find strong evidence for a robust chiral superconducting (SC) phase with dominant power-law pairing correlations and a quantized spin Chern number. The SC phase emerges at very weak interaction and grows stronger at intermediate interaction strengths (U ) for a wide range of hole doping. We also discuss the possible distinct nature of the normal state in different U regimes. Our work provides theoretical insights into the emergence of topological superconductivity from doping topological Chern bands or magnetic flux induced chiral spin liquid states of Moir\'e materials.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02757'&gt;arXiv:2509.02757&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 02 Sep 2025 19:04:03 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Deconfined Quantum Critical Point in Quantum Hall Bilayers</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03079</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Guangyu Yu, Tao Xiang, Zheng Zhu&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Deconfined quantum critical points (DQCPs) represent an unconventional class of quantum criticality beyond the Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson-Fisher paradigm. Nevertheless, both their theoretical identification and experimental realization remain challenging. Here we report compelling evidence of a DQCP in quantum Hall bilayers with half-filled $n=2$ Landau levels in each layer, based on large-scale variational uniform matrix product state (VUMPS) simulations and exact diagonalization (ED). By systematically analyzing the ground-state fidelity, low-lying energy spectra, exciton superfluid and stripe order parameters, and ground-state energy derivatives, we identify a direct and continuous quantum phase transition between two distinct symmetry-breaking phases by tuning the layer separation: an exciton superfluid phase with spontaneous $U(1)$ symmetry breaking at small separation, and a unidirectional charge density wave with broken translational symmetry at large separation. Our results highlight quantum Hall bilayers as an ideal platform for realizing and experimentally probing DQCPs under precisely tunable interactions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03079'&gt;arXiv:2509.03079&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 03 Sep 2025 07:18:11 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>TeRA: Vector-based Random Tensor Network for High-Rank Adaptation of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03234</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Yuxuan Gu, Wuyang Zhou, Giorgos Iacovides, Danilo Mandic&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods, such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), have significantly reduced the number of trainable parameters needed in fine-tuning large language models (LLMs). Subsequent developments of LoRA-style adapters have diverged into two main directions: (1) enhancing model expressivity with high-rank adapters, and (2) pushing for further parameter reduction, as exemplified by vector-based methods. However, these approaches present a trade-off, as achieving the expressivity of high-rank weight updates typically comes at the cost of sacrificing the extreme parameter efficiency offered by vector-based techniques. To address this issue, we propose a vector-based random \underline{\textbf{Te}}nsor network for high-\underline{\textbf{R}}ank \underline{\textbf{A}}daptation (TeRA), a novel PEFT method that achieves high-rank weight updates while retaining the parameter efficiency of vector-based PEFT adapters. This is achieved by parameterizing the tensorized weight update matrix as a Tucker-like tensor network (TN), in which large randomly initialized factors are frozen and shared across layers, while only small layer-specific scaling vectors, formed by entries in diagonal factor matrices, are trained. This design effectively decouples the rank of the weight update matrix from the number of trainable parameters. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that TeRA matches or even outperforms high-rank adapters, while requiring a trainable parameter count similar to vector-based methods. Theoretical analysis and ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of our approach.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03234'&gt;arXiv:2509.03234&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 03 Sep 2025 11:46:24 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Topology meets superconductivity in a one-dimensional $t-J$ model of magnetic atoms</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Leonardo Bellinato Giacomelli, Thomas Bland, Louis Lafforgue, Francesca Ferlaino, Manfred J. Mark, Luca Barbiero&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Strongly interacting fermions represent the key constituent of several intriguing phases of matter. However, due to the inherent complexity of these systems, important regimes are still inaccessible. Here, we derive a realistic and flexible setup based on ultracold magnetic lanthanide atoms trapped in a one-dimensional optical lattice. Leveraging their large magnetic moments, we design a fermionic $t-J$ model with independently tunable hopping, spin-spin couplings, and onsite interaction. Through combined analytical and numerical analysis, we uncover a variety of many-body quantum phases$-$including superconducting and topological states. Crucially, in the regime of attractive onsite interaction we reveal that topology and superconductivity coexist, thus giving rise to an exotic state of matter: a topological triplet superconductor. We also outline a practical protocol to prepare and detect all discovered phases using current experimental techniques. Our results establish an alternative and powerful route for a deeper understanding of strongly interacting fermionic quantum matter.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03387'&gt;arXiv:2509.03387&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 03 Sep 2025 15:05:11 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Universal representation of the long-range entanglement in the family of Toric Code states</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03422</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Mohammad Hossein Zarei, Mohsen Rahmani Haghighi&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Since the long range entanglement is a universal characteristic of topological quantum states belonging to the same class, a suitable mathematical representation of the long range entanglement has to be also universal. In this Letter, we introduce such a representation for the family of Toric Code states by using Kitaev's Ladders as building blocks. We consider Toric Code states corresponding to various planar graphs and apply non-local dientanglers to qubits corresponding to non-contractible cycles that satisfy a topological constraint. We demonstrate that, independent of the geometry of the underlying graph, disentanglers convert Toric Code states into a tensor product of Kitaev's Ladder states. Since Kitaev's Ladders with arbitrary geometric configurations include the short-range entanglements, we conclude that the above universal and non-local pattern of entanglement between ladders is responsible of the long-range entanglement inherent in Toric Code states. Our result emphasizes in the capability of such non-local representations to describe topological order in ground-state wave functions of topological quantum systems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03422'&gt;arXiv:2509.03422&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 03 Sep 2025 15:49:57 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Dissipationless dynamics of spin supersolid states in a spin-1/2 triangular antiferromagnet with impurities</title>

For both spin supersolid states in the low and high fields, the gapless Goldstone mode at the $K$ points remains robust with impurities, which is related to the presence of spin superfluidity. As a comparison, we find a splitting of magnon band at the same impurity density level in the conventional magnetic state, the so-called up-up-down state. In addition, the finite superfluid stiffness probed by the twisted phase in the spin supersolid states is consistent with the excitation spectrum. We argue that this excitation spectrum with impurity provides direct evidence of the dissipationless dynamics in the spin supersolid states, which could be tested in neutron scattering experiments.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03489'&gt;arXiv:2509.03489&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 03 Sep 2025 17:18:04 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>A new rung on the ladder: exploring topological frustration towards two dimensions</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03574</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Alberto Giuseppe Catalano, Nora Reinić, Gianpaolo Torre, Sven Benjamin Kožić, Karlo Delić, Simone Montangero, Fabio Franchini, Salvatore Marco Gianpaolo&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Topological frustration arises when boundary conditions impose geometric frustration in a quantum system, creating delocalized defects in the ground states and profoundly altering the low-energy properties. While previous studies have been concerned with one-dimensional systems, showing that the ground state structure can be described in terms of quasiparticle excitations, the two-dimensional setting remains unexplored. We address this gap by studying a three-legged antiferromagnetic quantum Ising ladder on a torus using tensor network methods, where topological frustration is induced by an odd number of spins along both spatial directions. Our results reveal the first instance in which topological frustration shifts the position of the quantum critical point. By studying the entanglement structure, we find that the ground state can be characterized as hosting three delocalized quasiparticles. This work builds the quasiparticle picture of topological frustration toward higher dimensions and more complex systems than those considered so far.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03574'&gt;arXiv:2509.03574&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 03 Sep 2025 18:00:02 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Trading Mathematical for Physical Simplicity: Bialgebraic Structures in Matrix Product Operator Symmetries</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03600</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Yuhan Liu, Andras Molnar, Xiao-Qi Sun, Frank Verstraete, Kohtaro Kato, Laurens Lootens&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Despite recent advances in the lattice representation theory of (generalized) symmetries, many simple quantum spin chains of physical interest are not included in the rigid framework of fusion categories and weak Hopf algebras. We demonstrate that this problem can be overcome by relaxing the requirements on the underlying algebraic structure, and show that general matrix product operator symmetries are described by a pre-bialgebra. As a guiding example, we focus on the anomalous $\mathbb Z_2$ symmetry of the XX model, which manifests the mixed anomaly between its $U(1)$ momentum and winding symmetry. We show how this anomaly is embedded into the non-semisimple corepresentation category, providing a novel mechanism for realizing such anomalous symmetries on the lattice. Additionally, the representation category which describes the renormalization properties is semisimple and semi-monoidal, which provides a new class of mixed state renormalization fixed points. Finally, we show that up to a quantum channel, this anomalous $\mathbb Z_2$ symmetry is equivalent to a more conventional MPO symmetry obtained on the boundary of a double semion model. In this way, our work provides a bridge between well-understood topological defect symmetries and those that arise in more realistic models.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03600'&gt;arXiv:2509.03600&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 03 Sep 2025 18:01:22 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Excitonic description of singlet fission beyond dimer model : a matrix product state approach</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03966</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Supriyo Santra, Amartya Bose, Debashree Ghosh&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The importance of singlet fission as a fundamental process with a variety of implications in energy harvesting cannot be overstated. The challenge is in characterizing the energy states of these large singlet fission molecular aggregates that participate in the process. Large dimensionality and essential multi-configuration nature of the electronic states of interest combine to make accurate ab initio calculations prohibitively difficult. We present a spin-resolved tight-binding excitonic model for singlet fission that can be parameterized based on ab initio calculations on monomers and dimers of molecules, and is highly suitable for the study of aggregates using tensor network methods such as the density matrix renormalization group. This tensor network coarse-grained model is demonstrated specifically on the pentacene crystal, where we evaluate the spectra and density of states. We show the natural emergence of bands of states in some cases, and characterize them. Through an analysis of entanglement entropy of the eigenstates, we gain crucial insight into the extent of their multireference character. This method is useful in understanding not just the structure of these extended aggregates, but also being the cornerstone for incorporation of vibronic features and simulation of the singlet fission dynamics.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03966'&gt;arXiv:2509.03966&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 04 Sep 2025 07:44:52 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

Long&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We construct a family of static, geometrically local Hamiltonians that inherit eigenstate properties of periodically-driven (Floquet) systems. Our construction is a variation of the Feynman-Kitaev clock -- a well-known mapping between quantum circuits and local Hamiltonians -- where the clock register is given periodic boundary conditions. Assuming the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) holds for the input circuit, our construction yields Hamiltonians whose eigenstates have properties characteristic of infinite temperature, like volume-law entanglement entropy, across the whole spectrum -- including the ground state. We then construct a family of exactly solvable Floquet quantum circuits whose eigenstates are shown to obey the ETH at infinite temperature. Combining the two constructions yields a new family of local Hamiltonians with provably volume-law-entangled ground states, and the first such construction where the volume law holds for all contiguous subsystems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04410'&gt;arXiv:2509.04410&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 04 Sep 2025 17:31:41 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Low-rank matrix and tensor approximations: advancing efficiency of machine-learning interatomic potentials</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04440</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Igor Vorotnikov, Fedor Romashov, Nikita Rybin, Maxim Rakhuba, Ivan S. Novikov&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) have become a mainstay in computationally-guided materials science, surpassing traditional force fields due to their flexible functional form and superior accuracy in reproducing physical properties of materials. This flexibility is achieved through mathematically-rigorous basis sets that describe interatomic interactions within a local atomic environment. The number of parameters in these basis sets influences both the size of the training dataset required and the computational speed of the MLIP. Consequently, compressing MLIPs by reducing the number of parameters is a promising route to more efficient simulations. In this work, we use low-rank matrix and tensor factorizations under fixed-rank constraints to achieve this compression. In addition, we demonstrate that an algorithm with automatic rank augmentation helps to find a deeper local minimum of the fitted potential. The methodology is verified using the Moment Tensor Potential (MTP) model and benchmarked on multi-component systems: a Mo-Nb-Ta-W medium-entropy alloy, molten LiF-NaF-KF, and a glycine molecular crystal. The proposed approach achieves up to 50% compression without any loss of MTP accuracy and can be applied to compress other MLIPs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04440'&gt;arXiv:2509.04440&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 04 Sep 2025 17:55:33 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

Using topological holography, we argue that a symmetric entangler should in fact exist for $1+1$d systems whenever the non-invertible symmetry has SPT phases connected by fixed-charge dualities (FCD). Moreover, we construct an explicit example of a symmetric entangler for the two SPT phases with $\mathrm{Rep}(A_4)$-symmetry, as a matrix product unitary (MPU).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04581'&gt;arXiv:2509.04581&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 04 Sep 2025 18:03:57 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>A systematic search for conformal field theories in very small spaces</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Xiang Li, Ting-Chun Lin, John McGreevy&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Groundstates of 1+1d conformal field theories (CFTs) satisfy a local entropic condition called the vector fixed point equation. This condition is surprisingly well satisfied by groundstates of quantum critical lattice models even at small system sizes. We perform a search in the space of states of very small systems (four qubits and four qutrits) and examine the states that satisfy this condition. By reconstructing a local Hamiltonian from each state, we are able to identify many of these solutions with known CFTs; others are gapped fixed points, or involve large relevant perturbations, and others are CFTs we have not yet identified. These ideas are also useful for identifying continuous quantum phase transitions in a given family of Hamiltonians, and for identifying the nature of the critical theory in small systems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04596'&gt;arXiv:2509.04596&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 04 Sep 2025 18:20:07 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Qi Yang, Philippe Corboz&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We develop a QR-based corner transfer matrix renormalization group (CTMRG) framework for contracting infinite projected entangled-pair states (iPEPS) on honeycomb lattices. Our method explicitly uses the lattice's native C3v symmetry at each site, generalizing QR-based acceleration (previously limited to square lattices) to enable efficient and stable contractions. This approach achieves order-of-magnitude speedups over conventional singular value decomposition (SVD)-based CTMRG while maintaining high numerical precision. Comprehensive benchmark calculations for the spin-1/2 Heisenberg and Kitaev models demonstrate higher computational efficiency without sacrificing accuracy. We further employ our method to study the Kitaev-Heisenberg model, where we provide numerical evidence for the universal 1/r^4 decay of the dimer-dimer correlation function within the quantum spin liquid (QSL) phase. Our work establishes a framework for extending QR-based CTMRG to other lattice geometries, opening new avenues for studying exotic quantum phases with tensor networks.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05090'&gt;arXiv:2509.05090&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 05 Sep 2025 13:29:46 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Site Basis Excitation Ansatz for Matrix Product States</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06241</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Steven R. White&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We introduce a simple and efficient variation of the tangent-space excitation ansatz used to compute elementary excitation spectra of one-dimensional quantum lattice systems using matrix product states (MPS). A small basis for the excitation tensors is formed based on a single diagonalization analogous to a single site DMRG step but for multiple states. Once overlap and Hamiltonian matrix elements are found, obtaining the excitation for any momentum only requires diagonalization of a tiny matrix, akin to a non-orthogonal band-theory diagonalization. The approach is based on an infinite MPS description of the ground state, and we introduce an extremely simple alternative to variational uniform matrix product states (VUMPS) based on finite system DMRG. For the $S=1$ Heisenberg chain, our method -- site basis excitation ansatz (SBEA) -- efficiently produces the one-magnon dispersion with high accuracy. We also examine the role of MPS gauge choices, finding that not imposing a gauge condition -- leaving the basis nonorthogonal -- is crucial for the approach, whereas imposing a left-orthonormal gauge (as in prior work) severely hampers convergence. We also show how one can construct Wannier excitations, analogous to the Wannier functions of band theory, where one Wannier excitation, translated to all sites, can reconstruct the single magnon modes exactly for all momenta.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06241'&gt;arXiv:2509.06241&lt;/a&gt;] Published Sun, 07 Sep 2025 23:05:55 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Classical Neural Networks on Quantum Devices via Tensor Network Disentanglers: A Case Study in Image Classification</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06653</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Borja Aizpurua, Sukhbinder Singh, Román Orús&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We address the problem of implementing bottleneck layers from classical pre-trained neural networks on a quantum computer, with the goal of achieving quantum advantage on near-term devices. Our approach begins with a compression step in which the target linear layer is represented as an effective matrix product operator (MPO) without degrading model performance. The MPO is then further disentangled into a more compact form. This enables a hybrid classical-quantum execution scheme, where the disentangling circuits are deployed on a quantum computer while the remainder of the network -- including the disentangled MPO -- runs on classical hardware. We introduce two complementary algorithms for MPO disentangling: (i) an explicitly disentangling variational method leveraging standard tensor-network optimization techniques, and (ii) an implicitly disentangling gradient-descent-based approach. We validate these methods through a proof-of-concept translation of simple classical neural networks for MNIST and CIFAR-10 image classification into a hybrid classical-quantum form.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06653'&gt;arXiv:2509.06653&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 08 Sep 2025 13:08:37 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Confinement, deconfinement, and bound states in the spin-$1$ and spin-$3/2$ generalizations of the Majumdar--Ghosh chain</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06720</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Aman Sharma, Mithilesh Nayak, Natalia Chepiga, Henrik M. Rønnow, Frédéric Mila&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We investigate the nature of low-energy excitations in a spin chain with antiferrmomagnetic nearest-neighbor $J_1$, next-nearest-neighbor $J_2$, and three-site $J_3$ interactions using the time-dependent density matrix renormalization group and the single mode approximation techniques. In the absence of the $J_2$ interaction, we identify clear distinctions in the spectral functions in the fully dimerized phase across the exactly dimerized line for different magnitudes of the spins. In contrast to the spin-$1/2$ chain, where the spinon continuum dominates the spectral functions, the magnon modes are prominent in the spectral functions of the spin-$1$ and spin-$3/2$ chains. Through single mode approximation and valence bond solid approaches, we disentangle magnon and spinon contributions to the spectral functions. After including the $J_2$ interactions, for the spin-$1$ chain we trace the evolution of the dynamical structure factor along the phase transition line between the Haldane phase and the fully dimerized phase. We find that the excitation spectrum is a continuum along this line and the spectral gap closes as the order of the transition changes from first order to second order. Along the line of first-order transitions, the spinon-like domain walls are deconfined, and the model exhibits their confinement into discrete bound states away from the transition line. A similar phenomenon occurs in the spin-$3/2$ chain across the phase transition between partially dimerized to fully dimerized phases, revealing a universal spinon confinement phenomenon across first-order phase transitions. This study presents the dynamical structure factor corresponding to the ground state phase diagram and establishes a unified quasiparticle framework for understanding the fundamental nature of excitations across distinct quantum phases in frustrated $J_1$-$J_2$-$J_3$ Heisenberg spin chains.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06720'&gt;arXiv:2509.06720&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 08 Sep 2025 14:16:08 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Tensor Network based Gene Regulatory Network Inference for Single-Cell Transcriptomic Data</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06891</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Olatz Sanz Larrarte, Borja Aizpurua, Reza Dastbasteh, Ruben M. Otxoa, Josu Etxezarreta Martinez&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Deciphering complex gene-gene interactions remains challenging in transcriptomics as traditional methods often miss higher-order and nonlinear dependencies. This study introduces a quantum-inspired framework leveraging tensor networks (TNs) to optimally map expression data into a lower dimensional representation preserving biological locality. Using Quantum Mutual Information (QMI), a nonparametric measure natural for tensor networks, we quantify gene dependencies and establish statistical significance via permutation testing. This constructs robust interaction networks where the edges reflect biologically meaningful relationships that are resilient to random chance. The approach effectively distinguishes true regulatory patterns from experimental noise and biological stochasticity. To test the proposed method, we recover a gene regulatory network consisted of six pathway genes from single-cell RNA sequencing data comprising over $28.000$ lymphoblastoid cells. Furthermore, we unveil several triadic regulatory mechanisms. By merging quantum physics inspired techniques with computational biology, our method provides novel insights into gene regulation, with applications in disease mechanisms and precision medicine.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06891'&gt;arXiv:2509.06891&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 08 Sep 2025 17:11:12 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Time evolution of controlled many-body quantum systems with matrix product operators</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Llorenç Balada Gaggioli, Jakub Mareček&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We present a method for describing the time evolution of many-body controlled quantum systems using matrix product operators (MPOs). Existing techniques for solving the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation (TDSE) with an MPO Hamiltonian often rely on time discretization. In contrast, our approach uses the Magnus expansion and Chebyshev polynomials to model the time evolution, and the MPO representation to efficiently encode the system's dynamics. This results in a scalable method that can be used efficiently for many-body controlled quantum systems. We apply this technique to quantum optimal control, specifically for a gate synthesis problem, demonstrating that it can be used for large-scale optimization problems that are otherwise impractical to formulate in a dense matrix representation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07228'&gt;arXiv:2509.07228&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 08 Sep 2025 21:13:27 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Large-scale Efficient Molecule Geometry Optimization with Hybrid Quantum-Classical Computing</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07460</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Yajie Hao, Qiming Ding, Xiaoting Wang, Xiao Yuan&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Accurately and efficiently predicting the equilibrium geometries of large molecules remains a central challenge in quantum computational chemistry, even with hybrid quantum-classical algorithms. Two major obstacles hinder progress: the large number of qubits required and the prohibitive cost of conventional nested optimization. In this work, we introduce a co-optimization framework that combines Density Matrix Embedding Theory (DMET) with Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) to address these limitations. This approach substantially reduces the required quantum resources, enabling the treatment of molecular systems significantly larger than previously feasible. We first validate our framework on benchmark systems, such as H4 and H2O2, before demonstrating its efficacy in determining the equilibrium geometry of glycolic acid C2H4O3, a molecule of a size previously considered intractable for quantum geometry optimization. Our results show the method achieves high accuracy while drastically lowering computational cost. This work thus represents a significant step toward practical, scalable quantum simulations, moving beyond the small, proof-of-concept molecules that have historically dominated the field. More broadly, our framework establishes a tangible path toward leveraging quantum advantage for the in silico design of complex catalysts and pharmaceuticals.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07460'&gt;arXiv:2509.07460&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 09 Sep 2025 07:31:29 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Process Tensor Approaches to Non-Markovian Quantum Dynamics</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07661</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Jonathan Keeling, E. Miles Stoudenmire, Mari-Carmen Bañuls, David R. Reichman&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The paradigm of considering open quantum systems -- i.e. focusing only on the system of interest, and treating the rest of the world as an effective environment -- has proven to be a highly effective way to understand a range of quantum systems, across areas of study such as quantum optics, cold atoms, superconducting qubits, and impurities in solid-state systems. A common approach in many of these contexts has been to consider simplified approaches based on the Born and Markov approximations. While these approximations are indeed often appropriate in contexts such as quantum optics, the widespread application of these approximations has been driven more by simplicity than by accuracy. In particular, these Markovian treatments will fail in many cases, such as when coupling to the environment is not weak, when the environment is structured and has resonances, when the system couples to low-frequency modes of the environment, or when the questions of interest involve the propagation of information through the environment. Despite the fact that many real problems are non-Markovian, the Markov approximation is still widely used, as it is often assumed that a fully non-Markovian treatment is too complex to be practical. In this perspective we discuss a recently developed set of techniques that address this challenge. Centering our discussion around the notion of the process tensor, we demonstrate that the generality of the process tensor concept, coupled with efficient tensor-network methods, opens the door to the description of a wide range of observable non-Markovian processes in a wide range of open quantum systems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07661'&gt;arXiv:2509.07661&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 09 Sep 2025 12:30:23 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>A Tensor Network Framework for Lindbladian Spectra and Steady States</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07709</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Philipp Westhoff, Mattia Moroder, Ulrich Schollwöck, Sebastian Paeckel&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Quantum systems coupled to (non-)Markovian environments attract increasing attention due to their peculiar physical properties. Exciting prospects such as unconventional non-equilibrium phases beyond the Mermin-Wagner limit, or the environment-assisted, robust preparation of highly entangled states, demand a systematic analysis of quantum many-body phases out of equilibrium. Akin to the equilibrium case, this requires the computation of the low-lying eigenstates of Lindbladians, a problem challenging conventional approaches for simulating quantum many-body systems. Here, we undertake a first step to overcome this limitation and introduce a tensor-network-based framework to compute systematically not only steady states, but also low-lying excited states with unprecedented precision for large, driven quantum many-body systems. Our framework is based on recent advances utilizing complex-time Krylov spaces, and we leverage these ideas to create a toolbox tailored to solve the challenging non-Hermitian eigenvalue problem ubiquitous in open quantum systems. At the example of the interacting Bose-Hubbard model driven by dissipation-assisted hopping, we demonstrate the high efficiency and accuracy, enabling us to perform a reliable finite-size scaling analysis of the spectral gap and demonstrating the existence of anomalous relaxation. This method unlocks the capability of spectral analysis of generic open quantum many-body systems, suitable also for non-Markovian environments.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07709'&gt;arXiv:2509.07709&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 09 Sep 2025 13:12:16 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Customizing the Inductive Biases of Softmax Attention using Structured Matrices</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07963</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Yilun Kuang, Noah Amsel, Sanae Lotfi, Shikai Qiu, Andres Potapczynski, Andrew Gordon Wilson&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The core component of attention is the scoring function, which transforms the inputs into low-dimensional queries and keys and takes the dot product of each pair. While the low-dimensional projection improves efficiency, it causes information loss for certain tasks that have intrinsically high-dimensional inputs. Additionally, attention uses the same scoring function for all input pairs, without imposing a distance-dependent compute bias for neighboring tokens in the sequence. In this work, we address these shortcomings by proposing new scoring functions based on computationally efficient structured matrices with high ranks, including Block Tensor-Train (BTT) and Multi-Level Low Rank (MLR) matrices. On in-context regression tasks with high-dimensional inputs, our proposed scoring functions outperform standard attention for any fixed compute budget. On language modeling, a task that exhibits locality patterns, our MLR-based attention method achieves improved scaling laws compared to both standard attention and variants of sliding window attention. Additionally, we show that both BTT and MLR fall under a broader family of efficient structured matrices capable of encoding either full-rank or distance-dependent compute biases, thereby addressing significant shortcomings of standard attention. Finally, we show that MLR attention has promising results for long-range time-series forecasting.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07963'&gt;arXiv:2509.07963&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 09 Sep 2025 17:50:58 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

Here we investigate whether this advantage is reflected in quantum magic, quantified through stabilizer R\'enyi entropies (SREs). We analyze one-dimensional models with an exact duality between a symmetry-protected topological phase and a trivial one. Surprisingly, a finite (parameters dependent) asymmetry appears only when boundary conditions break the duality, and emerges as well in the transverse-field Ising chain, which lacks topological order. These results show that magic is unable to detect topological phases, indicating that either an additional resource is required to capture their unique quantum contribution, or that not all forms of long-range entanglement constitute a genuine computational resource.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08053'&gt;arXiv:2509.08053&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 09 Sep 2025 18:00:07 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

In each case, snapshot data is represented in tensor--train format--either through compression or cross interpolation--enabling the efficient handling of extremely large datasets with significantly reduced computational effort compared to standard methods. The effectiveness of each approach is demonstrated through numerical experiments related to Computational Fluid Dynamics and benchmarked against the standard reduced--order operator inference method, highlighting the advantages of the tensor--train representations in both accuracy and scalability.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08071'&gt;arXiv:2509.08071&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 09 Sep 2025 18:18:56 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Kitaev-derived Gapless Spin Liquid in the $K$-$J$-$Γ$-$Γ'$ Quantum Magnet Na$_2$Co$_2$TeO$_6$</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08821</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Han Li, Xu-Guang Zhou, Gang Su, Wei Li&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The realization of quantum spin liquids (QSLs) in Kitaev magnets represents an intriguing topic in frustrated quantum magnetism. Despite prediction in the pure Kitaev honeycomb model, realization of QSLs in realistic systems and materials remain scarce. The recent discovery of cobalt-based compound Na$_2$Co$_2$TeO$_6$ has raised significant research interest. By establishing a realistic $K$-$J$-$\Gamma$-$\Gamma'$ model for Na$_2$Co$_2$TeO$_6$ -- with a dominant antiferromagnetic (AFM) Kitaev interaction ($K&gt;0$) that quantitatively explains its thermodynamics measurements -- we reveal an intermediate gapless QSL phase under [111] magnetic fields with tensor-network calculations. We confirm the QSL nature of this phase by demonstrating its adiabatic connection to the intensively studied intermediate QSL of the pure AFM Kitaev model under out-of-plane fields. Our results show excellent agreement with recent high-field experiments, thereby explaining the intermediate-field phase in Na$_2$Co$_2$TeO$_6$. These findings bridge the gap between theoretical proposals for a Kitaev-derived QSL and experimental realization, opening new avenues for exploring exotic quantum states of matter in realistic Kitaev materials.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08821'&gt;arXiv:2509.08821&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 10 Sep 2025 17:53:07 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Real-Time String Dynamics in a $2+1$D Non-Abelian Lattice Gauge Theory: String Breaking, Glueball Formation, Baryon Blockade, and Tension Reduction</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08868</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Giovanni Cataldi, Simone Orlando, Jad C. Halimeh&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Understanding flux string dynamics can provide insight into quark confinement and hadronization. First-principles quantum and numerical simulations have mostly focused on toy-model Abelian lattice gauge theories (LGTs). With the advent of state-of-the-art quantum simulation experiments, it is important to bridge this gap and study string dynamics in non-Abelian LGTs beyond one spatial dimension. Using tensor network methods, we simulate the real-time string dynamics of a $2\!+\!1$D SU$(2)$ Yang--Mills LGT with dynamical matter. In the strong-coupling regime and at resonance, string breaking occurs through sharp Casimir reduction along with meson and baryon-antibaryon formation, a distinctively non-Abelian feature. At finite baryon density, we discover a \textit{baryon blockade} mechanism that delays string breaking. Away from resonance, the magnetic term drives purely non-Abelian fluctuations: glueball loops and self-crossed strings that resolve two SU$(2)$ intertwiners with distinct dynamics. For higher-energy strings, we uncover representation-dependent tension-reduction resonances. Our findings serve as a guide for upcoming quantum simulators of non-Abelian LGTs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08868'&gt;arXiv:2509.08868&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 10 Sep 2025 12:16:21 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Demystifying quantum escapism on the honeycomb lattice</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08877</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; A. L. Chernyshev&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We demonstrate the versatility, simplicity, and power of the minimally-augmented spin-wave theory in studying phase diagrams of the quantum spin models in which unexpected magnetically ordered phases occur or the existing ones expand beyond their classical stability regions. We use this method to obtain approximate phase diagrams of the two paradigmatic spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ models on the honeycomb lattice: the $J_1$-$J_3$ ferro-antiferromagnetic and $J_1$-$J_2$ antiferromagnetic $XXZ$ models. For the $J_1$-$J_3$ case, various combinations of the $XXZ$ anisotropies are analyzed. In a dramatic deviation from their classical phase diagrams, which host significant regions of the noncollinear spiral phases, quantum fluctuations stabilize several unconventional collinear phases and significantly extend conventional ones to completely supersede spiral states. These results are in close agreement with the available density-matrix renormalization group calculations. The applicability of this approach to the other models and its potential extension to different types of orders are discussed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08877'&gt;arXiv:2509.08877&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 10 Sep 2025 18:00:00 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Bosonic realization of SU(3) chiral Haldane phases</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Linpu Zhang, Junjun Xu&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We give a bosonic realization of the SU(3) antiferromagnetic Heisenberg (AFH) chain in the alternating conjugate representation, and study its phase diagram as a function of staggered interactions and anisotropy along the $T^3$ and $T^8$ directions. Unlike the SU(2) case, we observe a chiral-reversed quantum phase transition, where each competing phase is adiabatically connected to one of the chiral Haldane phases predicted in the SU(3) AFH chain with local adjoint representation. In the vicinity of the Heisenberg point, we identify a symmetry-protected topological state that appears at the first excited energy level. We also study the spontaneous $\mathbb{Z}_3$ symmetry breaking of the system, and provide a variational wavefunction that captures the transition from the topological phase to the trivial phase. Finally, we propose an experimental realization of our bosonic model by two spin-1/2 bosons in an optical lattice.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09083'&gt;arXiv:2509.09083&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 11 Sep 2025 01:11:04 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Matrix product state classification of 1D multipole symmetry protected topological phases</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Takuma Saito, Weiguang Cao, Bo Han, Hiromi Ebisu&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Spatially modulated symmetries are one of the new types of symmetries whose symmetry actions are position dependent. Yet exotic phases resulting from these spatially modulated symmetries are not fully understood and classified. In this work, we systematically classify one dimensional bosonic symmetry protected topological phases protected respecting multipole symmetries by employing matrix product state formalism. The symmetry action induces projective representations at the ends of an open chain, which we identify via group cohomology. In particular, for $r$-pole symmetries, for instance, $r$ = 0 (global), 1 (dipole), and 2 (quadrupole), the classification is determined by distinct components of second cohomology groups that encode the boundary projective representations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09244'&gt;arXiv:2509.09244&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 11 Sep 2025 08:26:51 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>A Low-Rank tensor framework for THB-Splines</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09434</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Tom-Christian Riemer, Martin Stoll&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We introduce a low-rank framework for adaptive isogeometric analysis with truncated hierarchical B-splines (THB-splines) that targets the main bottleneck of local refinement: memory- and time-intensive matrix assembly once the global tensor-product structure is lost. The method interpolates geometry-induced weight and source terms in separable spline spaces and computes their tensor-train (TT) representations via the alternating minimal energy (AMEn) solver, enabling level-wise assembly of system operators using univariate quadrature. To recover separability in the adaptive setting, we reduce the active basis to tensor-product domains and partition active/non-active cells into a small number of Cartesian cuboids, so each contributes a Kronecker factor that is accumulated and rounded in TT. We realize the two-scale relation with truncation in low rank and assemble the global hierarchical operators in a block TT format suitable for iterative solvers. A prototype MATLAB implementation built on the GeoPDEs package and the TT-Toolbox demonstrates that, for model problems with moderately complex refinement regions, the approach reduces memory footprint and assembly time while maintaining accuracy; we also discuss limitations when ranks grow with geometric or refinement complexity. This framework advances scalable adaptive IgA with THB-splines, particularly in three dimensions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09434'&gt;arXiv:2509.09434&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 11 Sep 2025 13:19:23 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

We establish necessary and sufficient conditions on the bond dimensions of a tree tensor network to be minimal, generalizing a characterization of Carlini and Kleppe about existence of tensors with a given multilinear rank. We also show that in a minimal tree tensor network, the non-minimal tensors form a Zariski closed subset, so minimality is a generic property in this sense.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09463'&gt;arXiv:2509.09463&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 11 Sep 2025 13:44:49 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>PT symmetry-enriched non-unitary criticality</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Kuang-Hung Chou, Xue-Jia Yu, Po-Yao Chang&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The interplay between topology and quantum criticality gives rise to the notion of symmetry-enriched criticality, which has attracted considerable attention in recent years. However, its non-Hermitian counterpart remains largely unexplored. In this Letter, we show how parity-time (PT) symmetry enriches non-Hermitian critical points, giving rise to a topologically distinct non-unitary universality class. By analytically investigating non-Hermitian free fermion models with $PT$ symmetry, we uncover a new class of conformally invariant non-unitary critical points that host robust topological edge modes. Remarkably, the associated topological degeneracy is surprisingly encoded in the purely imaginary part of the entanglement entropy scaling-a feature absent in Hermitian systems. The underlying mechanism for the emergence of edge states at non-Hermitian criticality is traced to a generalized mass inversion that is absent in Hermitian systems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09587'&gt;arXiv:2509.09587&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 11 Sep 2025 16:24:32 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Entanglement architecture of beyond-Landau quantum criticality</title>

Here, we use entanglement microscopy--full tomography of the reduced density matrix of small subregions and subsequent extraction of their quantum correlations--to resolve the entanglement architecture near such exotic critical points. We focus on genuine multipartite entanglement (GME). Through unbiased quantum Monte Carlo sampling of RDMs across conventional O(2)/O(3) Wilson-Fisher transitions, and unconventional XY$^*$, and N\'eel-VBS transitions in (2+1)d, we discover a dichotomy: Landau criticality amplifies GME within compact subregions, while non-Landau criticality redistributes entanglement into larger, loopy configurations. Key signatures at non-Landau criticality include the absence of three-spin GME, and the loss of non-loopy entanglement in unicursal regions. Similar results in a critical resonating valence bond wavefunction confirm this multipartite entanglement structure as a common feature of emergent gauge theories. Our findings reveal a distinct entanglement architecture in beyond-Landau quantum critical theories.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09983'&gt;arXiv:2509.09983&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 12 Sep 2025 05:55:50 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>The low-rank tensor-train finite difference method for three-dimensional parabolic equations</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10142</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Gianmarco Manzini, Tommaso Sorgente&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; This paper presents a numerical framework for the low-rank approximation of the solution to three-dimensional parabolic problems. The key contribution of this work is the tensorization process based on a tensor-train reformulation of the second-order accurate finite difference method. We advance the solution in time by combining the finite difference method with an explicit and implicit Euler method and with the Crank-Nicolson method. We solve the linear system arising at each time step from the implicit and semi-implicit time-marching schemes through a matrix-free preconditioned conjugate gradient (PCG) method, appositely designed to exploit the separation of variables induced by the tensor-train format. We assess the performance of our method through extensive numerical experimentation, demonstrating that the tensor-train design offers a robust and highly efficient alternative to the traditional approach. Indeed, the usage of this type of representation leads to massive time and memory savings while guaranteeing almost identical accuracy with respect to the traditional one. These features make the method particularly suitable to tackle challenging high-dimensional problems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10142'&gt;arXiv:2509.10142&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 12 Sep 2025 11:10:23 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Coarse-Grained BCFT Tensor Networks and Holographic Reflected Entropy in 3D Gravity</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10170</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Ning Bao, Jinwei Chu, Yikun Jiang, Jacob March&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We use the framework of $\textit{BCFT tensor networks}$ to present a microscopic CFT derivation of the correspondence between reflected entropy (RE) and entanglement wedge cross section (EW) in AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$, for both bipartite and multipartite settings. These fixed-point tensor networks, obtained by triangulating Euclidean CFT path integrals, allow us to explicitly construct the canonical purification via cutting-and-gluing CFT path integrals. Employing modular flow in the large-$c$ limit, we demonstrate that these intrinsic CFT manipulations reproduce bulk geometric prescriptions, without assuming the AdS/CFT dictionary. The emergence of bulk geometry is traced to coarse-graining over heavy states in the large-$c$ limit. Universal coarse-grained BCFT data for compact 2D CFTs, through the relation to Liouville theory with ZZ boundary conditions, yields hyperbolic geometry on the Cauchy slice. The corresponding averaged replica partition functions reproduce all candidate EWs, arising from different averaging patterns, with the dominant one providing the correct RE and EW. In this way, many heuristic tensor-network intuitions in toy models are made precise and established directly from intrinsic CFT data.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10170'&gt;arXiv:2509.10170&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 12 Sep 2025 11:55:15 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Tunable Magnetic Order in Chiral Coupled Spin Chains</title>

Viana Parente Lopes, Hugo Terças&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We obtain the ground-state phase diagram of two spin chains consisting in a set two-level systems asymmetrically coupled to an XX chain through a chiral interaction. The interaction is parametrized by its magnitude and an angle defined by the relative orientation of the spins in different chains. From the entanglement spectrum, we identify the critical lines separating distinct magnetically ordered phases, with the interaction angle able to shift or fully suppress the transition. By increasing the coupling strength, the systems is driven through a quantum phase transition, leading to the formation of two types of in-plane antiferromagnetic stripes. The interaction strength sets stripe formation, while the angle controls the spins orientations. The chiral interaction also induces a non-trivial finite vector spin chirality with opposite orientation on the chains. We show that the vector spin chirality emerges smoothly from the decoupled limit and occurs for angles different from zero and $\pi/2$, where collinear order is favored instead.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10286'&gt;arXiv:2509.10286&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 12 Sep 2025 14:25:42 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

Starting from a non-equilibrium initial state with localized energy excitation on top of vacuum, we track the subsequent evolution to investigate two distinct physical phenomena. First, by analyzing the system's energy-momentum tensor, we show that this system exhibits hydrodynamic behavior analogous to Bjorken flow at large coupling-to-mass ratio, a signature that diminishes as the coupling weakens, or mass increases. Second, by examining the evolution of the electric field and charge density, we observe the signal of spontaneous parity symmetry breaking phase transition in a dynamical system. The parity-restored regime is marked by ''string breaking'' and efficient charge screening, while the parity-broken regime displays stable propagation of nearly free charges and persistent electric fields connecting them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10835'&gt;arXiv:2509.10835&lt;/a&gt;] Published Sat, 13 Sep 2025 14:56:58 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Onset of Bjorken Flow in Quantum Evolution of the Massive Schwinger Model</title>

A first-principle simulation requires a real-time, non-perturbative calculation of the quantum system. In this Letter, we perform such simulations using the tensor network method, which enables large-scale quantum many-body simulations by retaining only the most essential quantum states for collective behaviors. We focus on the massive Schwinger model, a low-dimensional analog of quantum chromodynamics (QCD), as they share important properties such as confinement and chiral symmetry breaking. Starting from an initial state that puts a localized excitation atop the vacuum and mimics the energy deposition from colliding nuclei, we observe hydrodynamic behavior consistent with Bjorken flow in all relevant degrees of freedom: energy density, fluid velocity, and bulk pressure. The time scale for hydrodynamic onset aligns with the thermalization time of the quantum distribution function.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10855'&gt;arXiv:2509.10855&lt;/a&gt;] Published Sat, 13 Sep 2025 15:24:56 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Vanishing Signatures, Orbit Closure, and the Converse of the Holant Theorem</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10991</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Jin-Yi Cai, Ben Young&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Valiant's Holant theorem is a powerful tool for algorithms and reductions for counting problems. It states that if two sets $\mathcal{F}$ and $\mathcal{G}$ of tensors (a.k.a. constraint functions or signatures) are related by a \emph{holographic transformation}, then $\mathcal{F}$ and $\mathcal{G}$ are \emph{Holant-indistinguishable}, i.e., every tensor network using tensors from $\mathcal{F}$, resp. from $\mathcal{G}$, contracts to the same value. Xia (ICALP 2010) conjectured the converse of the Holant theorem, but a counterexample was found based on \emph{vanishing} signatures, those which are Holant-indistinguishable from 0. We prove two near-converses of the Holant theorem using techniques from invariant theory. (I) Holant-indistinguishable $\mathcal{F}$ and $\mathcal{G}$ always admit two sequences of holographic transformations mapping them arbitrarily close to each other, i.e., their $\text{GL}_q$-orbit closures intersect. (II) We show that vanishing signatures are the only true obstacle to a converse of the Holant theorem. As corollaries of the two theorems we obtain the first characterization of homomorphism-indistinguishability over graphs of bounded degree, a long standing open problem, and show that two graphs with invertible adjacency matrices are isomorphic if and only if they are homomorphism-indistinguishable over graphs with maximum degree at most three. We also show that Holant-indistinguishability is complete for a complexity class \textbf{TOCI} introduced by Lysikov and Walter, and hence hard for graph isomorphism.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10991'&gt;arXiv:2509.10991&lt;/a&gt;] Published Sat, 13 Sep 2025 21:58:59 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Frederik Kelbel, Sergey Dolgov, Dante Kalise, Alessandra Russo&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; In this work, we introduce an interior-point method that employs tensor decompositions to efficiently represent and manipulate the variables and constraints of semidefinite programs, targeting problems where the solutions may not be low-rank but admit low-tensor-train rank approximations. Our method maintains approximate superlinear convergence despite inexact computations in the tensor format and leverages a primal-dual infeasible interior-point framework. In experiments on Maximum Cut, Maximum Stable Set, and Correlation Clustering, the tensor-train interior point method handles problems up to size $2^{12}$ with duality gaps around $10^{-6}$ in approximately 1.5~h and using less than 2~GB of memory, outperforming state-of-the-art solvers on larger instances. Moreover, numerical evidence indicates that tensor-train ranks of the iterates remain moderate along the interior-point trajectory, explaining the scalability of the approach. Tensor-train interior point methods offer a promising avenue for problems that lack traditional sparsity or low-rank structure, exploiting tensor-train structures instead.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11890'&gt;arXiv:2509.11890&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 15 Sep 2025 13:07:39 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Generalization of the Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki Model for Quantum Ferromagnetism</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11537</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Isao Maruyama, Shin Miyahara&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We generalize the Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki model to a spin-\(S\) ferromagnetic model with exactly-written ground states, known as the partially-magnetized valence bond solid (VBS) states with magnetization $m=(S-1)/S$. We find that the VBS state and an antiferromagnetic ground state with magnetization $m=0$ are degenerate for $S=3/2$ and $S=2$ by using the Lanczos method and the density matrix renormalization group method (DMRG). However, increasing $S$, the magnetization of the ground states is uniquely determined as the fraction $m=(S-1)/S$. This is not just a ferromagnet, but a quantum ferromagnet due to quantum entanglement inherent in VBS states. In the low-energy excitation spectrum, we find the coexistence of the Haldane gap and Goldstone-like ferromagnetic magnon excitation. This ``magnetic chimera'' clearly appears under a finite magnetic field. Finally, we discuss an application to the measurement-based quantum computation and an extension of the Haldane's conjecture.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11537'&gt;arXiv:2509.11537&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 15 Sep 2025 03:04:12 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Optimizing Quantum Photonic Integrated Circuits using Differentiable Tensor Networks</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11861</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Mathias Van Regemortel, Thomas Van Vaerenbergh&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Recent reports of large photonic nonlinearities in integrated photonic devices, using the strong excitonic light-matter coupling in semiconductors, necessitate a tailored design framework for quantum processing in the limit of low photon occupation. We present a gradient-based optimization method for quantum photonic integrated circuits, which are composed of nonlinear unitary coupling gates and stochastic, nonunitary components for sampling the photonic losses. As core of our method, differentiable tensor-networks are leveraged, which are accurate in the regime of low photonic occupation and modest intermode entanglement. After characterizing the circuit gate architecture with field simulations of GaAs-based samples, we demonstrate the applicability of our method by optimizing quantum photonic circuits for two key use cases: integrated designs for quantum optical state preparation and tailored optimal readout for quantum phase sensing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11861'&gt;arXiv:2509.11861&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 15 Sep 2025 12:35:14 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Characterizing Scaling Trends of Post-Compilation Circuit Resources for NISQ-era QML Models</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11980</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Rupayan Bhattacharjee, Pau Escofet, Santiago Rodrigo, Sergi Abadal, Carmen G. Almudever, Eduard Alarcón&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; This work investigates the scaling characteristics of post-compilation circuit resources for Quantum Machine Learning (QML) models on connectivity-constrained NISQ processors. We analyze Quantum Kernel Methods and Quantum Neural Networks across processor topologies (linear, ring, grid, star), focusing on SWAP overhead, circuit depth, and two-qubit gate count. Our findings reveal that entangling strategy significantly impacts resource scaling, with circular and shifted circular alternating strategies showing steepest scaling. Ring topology demonstrates slowest resource scaling for most QML models, while Tree Tensor Networks lose their logarithmic depth advantage after compilation. Through fidelity analysis under realistic noise models, we establish quantitative relationships between hardware improvements and maximum reliable qubit counts, providing crucial insights for hardware-aware QML model design across the full-stack architecture.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11980'&gt;arXiv:2509.11980&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 15 Sep 2025 14:26:24 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Spectral Small-Incremental-Entangling: Breaking Quasi-Polynomial Complexity Barriers in Long-Range Interacting Systems</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12014</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Donghoon Kim, Yusuke Kimura, Hugo Mackay, Yosuke Mitsuhashi, Hideaki Nishikawa, Carla Rubiliani, Cheng Shang, Ayumi Ukai, Tomotaka Kuwahara&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; A key challenge in quantum complexity is how entanglement structure emerges from dynamics, highlighted by advances in simulators and information processing. The Lieb--Robinson bound sets a locality-based speed limit on information propagation, while the Small-Incremental-Entangling (SIE) theorem gives a universal constraint on entanglement growth. Yet, SIE bounds only total entanglement, leaving open the fine entanglement structure. In this work, we introduce Spectral-Entangling Strength, measuring the structural entangling power of an operator, and prove a Spectral SIE theorem: a universal limit for R\'enyi entanglement growth at $\alpha \ge 1/2$, revealing a robust $1/s^2$ tail in the entanglement spectrum. At $\alpha=1/2$ the bound is qualitatively and quantitatively optimal, identifying the universal threshold beyond which growth is unbounded. This exposes the detailed structure of Schmidt coefficients, enabling rigorous truncation-based error control and linking entanglement to computational complexity. Our framework further establishes a generalized entanglement area law under adiabatic paths, extending a central principle of many-body physics to general interactions. Practically, we show that 1D long-range interacting systems admit polynomial bond-dimension approximations for ground, time-evolved, and thermal states. This closes the quasi-polynomial gap and proves such systems are simulable with polynomial complexity comparable to short-range models. By controlling R\'enyi entanglement, we also derive the first rigorous precision-guarantee bound for the time-dependent density-matrix-renormalization-group algorithm. Overall, our results extend SIE and provide a unified framework that reveals the detailed structure of quantum complexity.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12014'&gt;arXiv:2509.12014&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 15 Sep 2025 14:56:40 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>From hidden order to skyrmions: Quantum Hall states in an extended Hofstadter-Fermi-Hubbard model</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12184</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Fabian J. Pauw, Ulrich Schollwöck, Nathan Goldman, Sebastian Paeckel, Felix A. Palm&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The interplay between topology and strong interactions gives rise to a variety of exotic quantum phases, including fractional quantum Hall (FQH) states and their lattice analogs - fractional Chern insulators (FCIs). Such topologically ordered states host fractionalized excitations, which for spinful systems are often accompanied by ferromagnetism and skyrmions. Here, we study a Hofstadter-Hubbard model of spinful fermions on a square lattice, extended by nearest-neighbor interactions. Using large-scale density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations, we demonstrate the emergence of a spin-polarized $\frac{1}{3}$-Laughlin-like FCI phase, characterized by a quantized many-body Chern number, a finite charge gap, and hidden off-diagonal long-range order. We further investigate the quantum Hall ferromagnet at $\nu=1$ and its skyrmionic excitations upon doping. In particular, we find that nearest-neighbor repulsion is sufficient to stabilize both particle- and hole-skyrmions in the ground state around $\nu=1$, whereas we do not find such textures around $\nu=\frac{1}{3}$. The diagnostic toolbox presented in this work, based on local densities, correlation functions, and spin-resolved observables, is directly applicable in quantum gas microscopy experiments. Our results open new pathways for experimental exploration of FCIs with spin textures in both ultracold atom and electronic systems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12184'&gt;arXiv:2509.12184&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 15 Sep 2025 17:45:50 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>
