      <title>Full grid solution for multi-asset options pricing with tensor networks</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00009</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Lucas Arenstein, Michael Kastoryano&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Pricing multi-asset options via the Black-Scholes PDE is limited by the curse of dimensionality: classical full-grid solvers scale exponentially in the number of underlyings and are effectively restricted to three assets. Practitioners typically rely on Monte Carlo methods for computing complex instrument involving multiple correlated underlyings. We show that quantized tensor trains (QTT) turn the d-asset Black-Scholes PDE into a tractable high-dimensional problem on a personal computer. We construct QTT representations of the operator, payoffs, and boundary conditions with ranks that scale polynomially in d and polylogarithmically in the grid size, and build two solvers: a time-stepping algorithm for European and American options and a space-time algorithm for European options. We compute full-grid prices and Greeks for correlated basket and max-min options in three to five dimensions with high accuracy. The methods introduced can comfortably be pushed to full-grid solutions on 10-15 underlyings, with further algorithmic optimization and more compute power.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00009'&gt;arXiv:2601.00009&lt;/a&gt;] Published Sat, 20 Dec 2025 17:24:57 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Random-Matrix-Induced Simplicity Bias in Over-parameterized Variational Quantum Circuits</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01877</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Jun Qi, Chao-Han Huck Yang, Pin-Yu Chen, Min-Hsiu Hsieh&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Over-parameterization is commonly used to increase the expressivity of variational quantum circuits (VQCs), yet deeper and more highly parameterized circuits often exhibit poor trainability and limited generalization. In this work, we provide a theoretical explanation for this phenomenon from a function-class perspective. We show that sufficiently expressive, unstructured variational ansatze enter a Haar-like universality class in which both observable expectation values and parameter gradients concentrate exponentially with system size. As a consequence, the hypothesis class induced by such circuits collapses with high probability to a narrow family of near-constant functions, a phenomenon we term simplicity bias, with barren plateaus arising as a consequence rather than the root cause. Using tools from random matrix theory and concentration of measure, we rigorously characterize this universality class and establish uniform hypothesis-class collapse over finite datasets. We further show that this collapse is not unavoidable: tensor-structured VQCs, including tensor-network-based and tensor-hypernetwork parameterizations, lie outside the Haar-like universality class. By restricting the accessible unitary ensemble through bounded tensor rank or bond dimension, these architectures prevent concentration of measure, preserve output variability for local observables, and retain non-degenerate gradient signals even in over-parameterized regimes. Together, our results unify barren plateaus, expressivity limits, and generalization collapse under a single structural mechanism rooted in random-matrix universality, highlighting the central role of architectural inductive bias in variational quantum algorithms.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01877'&gt;arXiv:2601.01877&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 05 Jan 2026 08:04:33 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>TT-FSI: Scalable Faithful Shapley Interactions via Tensor-Train</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01903</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Ungsik Kim, Suwon Lee&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The Faithful Shapley Interaction (FSI) index uniquely satisfies the faithfulness axiom among Shapley interaction indices, but computing FSI requires $O(d^\ell \cdot 2^d)$ time and existing implementations use $O(4^d)$ memory. We present TT-FSI, which exploits FSI's algebraic structure via Matrix Product Operators (MPO). Our main theoretical contribution is proving that the linear operator $v \mapsto \text{FSI}(v)$ admits an MPO representation with TT-rank $O(\ell d)$, enabling an efficient sweep algorithm with $O(\ell^2 d^3 \cdot 2^d)$ time and $O(\ell d^2)$ core storage an exponential improvement over existing methods. Experiments on six datasets ($d=8$ to $d=20$) demonstrate up to 280$\times$ speedup over baseline, 85$\times$ over SHAP-IQ, and 290$\times$ memory reduction. TT-FSI scales to $d=20$ (1M coalitions) where all competing methods fail.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01903'&gt;arXiv:2601.01903&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 05 Jan 2026 08:49:25 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Longitudinal-field fidelity susceptibility analysis of the $J_1$-$J_2$ transverse-field Ising model around $J_2/J_1 \approx 0.5$</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01893</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Yoshihiro Nishiyama&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The square-lattice $J_1$-$J_2$ transverse-field (TF) Ising model was investigated with the exact diagonalization (ED) method. In order to analyze the TF-driven phase transition, we applied the longitudinal-field fidelity susceptibility $χ^{(h)}_F$, which is readily evaluated via the ED scheme. Here, the longitudinal field couples with the absolute value of the magnetic moment $|M|$ rather than the raw $M$ so that the remedied fidelity susceptibility exhibits a peak around the critical point; note that the spontaneous magnetization does not appear for the finite-size systems. As a preliminary survey, the modified fidelity susceptibility $χ^{(h)}_F$ is applied to the analysis of criticality for $J_2=0$, where a number of preceding results are available. Thereby, properly scaling the distance from the multi-criticality, $η=0.5-J_2$, the $χ^{(h)}_F$ data were cast into the crossover-scaling formula, and the multi-critical exponent for $χ_F^{(h)}$ is estimated. The result is cross-checked by the numerically evaluated $β$-function behavior.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01893'&gt;arXiv:2601.01893&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 05 Jan 2026 08:36:02 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Charge disproportionation as a possible mechanism towards polar antiferromagnetic metal in molecular orbital crystal</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02048</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Yang Shen, Shuai Qu, Gang Li, Pu Yu, Guang-Ming Zhang&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Polar antiferromagnetic metals have recently garnered increasing interests due to their combined traits of both ferromagnets and antiferromagnets for spintronic applications. However, the inherently incompatible nature of antiferromagnet, metallicity and polarity pose a significant challenge. We propose that charge disproportionation can lead to this novel state in negative charge transfer gap regime in molecular orbital crystal by molecular orbital analyses of first-principles DFT+$U$ electronic band structure for representative Ruddlesden-Popper bilayer perovskite oxides Sr$_3$Co$_2$O$_7$, corroborated by Density Matrix Renormalization Group calculation. Due to the negative charge transfer nature of Co$^{4+}$ and imposed by strong interlayer coupling, localized molecular orbitals stemming from the hybridization of Co $d_{z^2}$ and $d_{xz/yz}$ orbitals through the apical oxygen $p$ orbitals are preferably emergent within each bilayer unit, which develop antiferromagnetic ordering by invoking Hubbard repulsion. Charge disproportionation driven by Hund's physics, makes an occupation imbalance with broken inversion symmetry in the remaining $d_{xy}$ and $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals from distinct Co atoms within the bilayer unit, resulting in the polar metallicity. Meanwhile, this charge disproportionation scenario allows consequent conducting carriers to couple with interlayer local spins via Hund's coupling, giving rise to in-plane double-exchange ferromagnetism. Our molecular orbital formulation further provides a guide towards an effective Hamiltonian for modelling the unconventional synergy of metallicity, polarity and antiferromagnetism in Sr$_3$Co$_2$O$_7$, which may be a unified framework widely applicable to double-layer Ruddlesden-Popper perovskite oxides.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02048'&gt;arXiv:2601.02048&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 05 Jan 2026 12:07:38 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Efficient Calculation of the Maximal Rényi Divergence for a Matrix Product State via Generalized Eigenvalue Density Matrix Renormalization Group</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02122</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Uri Levin, Noa Feldman, Moshe Goldstein&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The study of quantum and classical correlations between subsystems is fundamental to understanding many-body physics. In quantum information theory, the quantum mutual information, $I(A;B)$, is a measure of correlation between the subsystems $A,B$ in a quantum state, and is defined by the means of the von Neumann entropy: $I\left(A;B\right)=S\left(ρ_{A}\right)+S\left(ρ_{B}\right)-S\left(ρ_{AB}\right)$. However, such a computation requires an exponential amount of resources. This is a defining feature of quantum systems, the infamous ``curse of dimensionality'' . Other measures, which are based on Rényi divergences instead of von Neumann entropy, were suggested as alternatives in a recent paper showing them to possess important theoretical features, and making them leading candidates as mutual information measures. In this work, we concentrate on the maximal Rényi divergence. This measure can be shown to be the solution of a generalized eigenvalue problem. To calculate it efficiently for a 1D state represented as a matrix product state, we develop a generalized eigenvalue version of the density matrix renormalization group algorithm. We benchmark our method for the paradigmatic XXZ chain, and show that the maximal Rényi divergence may exhibit different trends than the von Neumann mutual information.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02122'&gt;arXiv:2601.02122&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 05 Jan 2026 13:54:16 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Quantum dynamics of cosmological particle production: interacting quantum field theories with matrix product states</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02331</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Evan Budd, Adrien Florio, David Frenklakh, Swagato Mukherjee&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Understanding real-time dynamics of interacting quantum fields in curved spacetime remains a major theoretical challenge. We employ tensor network methods to study such dynamics using interacting scalar and gauge theories in 1+1 spacetime dimensions, subject to a quench modeling a homogeneously expanding gravitational background. The models considered are the scalar $λφ^4$ theory and the Schwinger model, i.e. a Dirac fermion coupled to a $U(1)$ gauge field which is equivalent via bosonization to a scalar field with a cosine self-interaction. In the free scalar limit, both theories reproduce known analytical results, providing a nontrivial numerical validation of bosonization in curved spacetime for the Schwinger model. Our central finding is that self-interactions lead to a suppression of gravitational particle production compared to the free-field case, as evidenced by two-point functions and the spectra of produced particles. We further examine the behavior of entanglement generation and find that interactions suppress entanglement growth in the $λφ^4$ theory, while in the Schwinger model, the interplay between suppressed particle production and enhanced inter-particle correlations leads to more complex entanglement behavior. Our results pave the way for further explorations of nonperturbative quantum real-time dynamics of interacting scalar and gauge theories in arbitrary gravitational backgrounds.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02331'&gt;arXiv:2601.02331&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 05 Jan 2026 18:23:52 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Tensor renormalization group approach to critical phenomena via symmetry-twisted partition functions</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02681</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Shinichiro Akiyama, Raghav G. Jha, Jun Maeda, Yuya Tanizaki, Judah Unmuth-Yockey&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The locality of field theories strongly constrains the possible behaviors of symmetry-twisted partition functions, and thus they serve as order parameters to detect low-energy realizations of global symmetries, such as spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB). We demonstrate that the tensor renormalization group (TRG) offers an efficient framework to compute the symmetry-twisted partition functions, which enables us to detect the symmetry-breaking transition and also to study associated critical phenomena. As concrete examples of SSB, we investigate the two-dimensional (2D) classical Ising model and the three-dimensional (3D) classical $O(2)$ nonlinear sigma model, and we identify their critical points solely from the twisted partition function. By employing the finite-size scaling argument, we find the critical temperature $T_c=2.2017(2)$ with the critical exponent $ν= 0.663(33)$ for the 3D $O(2)$ model. In addition, we also study the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) criticality of the 2D classical $O(2)$ model by extracting the helicity modulus from the twisted partition functions, and we obtain the BKT transition temperature, $T_{\mathrm{BKT}}=0.8928(2)$.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02681'&gt;arXiv:2601.02681&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 06 Jan 2026 03:27:16 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Asymptotic freedom, lost: Complex conformal field theory in the two-dimensional $O(N&gt;2)$ nonlinear sigma model and its realization in the spin-1 Heisenberg chain</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02459</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Christopher Yang, Thomas Scaffidi&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The two-dimensional $O(N)$ nonlinear sigma model (NLSM) is asymptotically free for $N&gt;2$: it exhibits neither a nontrivial fixed point nor spontaneous symmetry-breaking. Here we show that a nontrivial fixed point generically does exist in the $\textit{complex}$ coupling plane and is described by a complex conformal field theory (CCFT). This CCFT fixed point is generic in the sense that it has a single relevant singlet operator, and is thus expected to arise in any non-Hermitian model with $O(N)$ symmetry upon tuning a single complex parameter. We confirm this prediction numerically by locating the CCFT at $N = 3$ in a non-Hermitian spin-1 antiferromagnetic Heisenberg chain, finding good agreement between the complex central charge and scaling dimensions and those obtained by analytic continuation of real fixed points from $N\leq 2$. We further construct a realistic Lindbladian for a spin-1 chain whose no-click dynamics are governed by the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian realizing the CCFT. Since the CCFT vacuum is the eigenstate with the smallest decay rate, the system naturally relaxes under dissipative dynamics toward a CFT state, thus providing a route to preparing long-range entangled states through engineered dissipation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02459'&gt;arXiv:2601.02459&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 05 Jan 2026 19:00:00 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Who can compete with quantum computers? Lecture notes on quantum inspired tensor networks computational techniques</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03035</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Xavier Waintal, Chen-How Huang, Christoph W. Groth&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; This is a set of lectures on tensor networks with a strong emphasis on the core algorithms involving Matrix Product States (MPS) and Matrix Product Operators (MPO). Compared to other presentations, particular care has been given to disentangle aspects of tensor networks from the quantum many-body problem: MPO/MPS algorithms are presented as a way to deal with linear algebra on extremely (exponentially) large matrices and vectors, regardless of any particular application. The lectures include well-known algorithms to find eigenvectors of MPOs (the celebrated DMRG), solve linear problems, and recent learning algorithms that allow one to map a known function into an MPS (the Tensor Cross Interpolation, or TCI, algorithm). The lectures end with a discussion of how to represent functions and perform calculus with tensor networks using the "quantics" representation. They include the detailed analytical construction of important MPOs such as those for differentiation, indefinite integration, convolution, and the quantum Fourier transform. Three concrete applications are discussed in detail: the simulation of a quantum computer (either exactly or with compression), the simulation of a quantum annealer, and techniques to solve partial differential equations (e.g. Poisson, diffusion, or Gross-Pitaevskii) within the "quantics" representation. The lectures have been designed to be accessible to a first-year PhD student and include detailed proofs of all statements.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03035'&gt;arXiv:2601.03035&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 06 Jan 2026 14:09:10 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Iterative Matrix Product State Simulation for Scalable Grover's Algorithm</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03832</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Mei Ian Sam, Tzu-Ling Kuo, Tai-Yue Li&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Grover's algorithm is a cornerstone of quantum search algorithm, offering quadratic speedup for unstructured problems. However, limited qubit counts and noise in today's noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices hinder large-scale hardware validation, making efficient classical simulation essential for algorithm development and hardware assessment. We present an iterative Grover simulation framework based on matrix product states (MPS) to efficiently simulate large-scale Grover's algorithm. Within the NVIDIA CUDA-Q environment, we compare iterative and common (non-iterative) Grover's circuits across statevector and MPS backends. On the MPS backend at 29 qubits, the iterative Grover's circuit runs about 15x faster than the common (non-iterative) Grover's circuit, and about 3-4x faster than the statevector backend. In sampling experiments, Grover's circuits demonstrate strong low-shot stability: as the qubit number increases beyond 13, a single-shot measurement still closely mirrors the results from 4,096 shots, indicating reliable estimates with minimal sampling and significant potential to cut measurement costs. Overall, an iterative MPS design delivers speed and scalability for Grover's circuit simulation, enabling practical large-scale implementations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03832'&gt;arXiv:2601.03832&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 07 Jan 2026 11:55:26 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Local Interpolation via Low-Rank Tensor Trains</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03885</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Siddhartha E. Guzman, Egor Tiunov, Leandro Aolita&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Tensor Train (TT) decompositions provide a powerful framework to compress grid-structured data, such as sampled function values, on regular Cartesian grids. Such high compression, in turn, enables efficient high-dimensional computations. Exact TT representations are only available for simple analytic functions. Furthermore, global polynomial or Fourier expansions typically yield TT-ranks that grow proportionally with the number of basis terms. State-of-the-art methods are often prohibitively expensive or fail to recover the underlying low-rank structure. We propose a low-rank TT interpolation framework that, given a TT describing a discrete (scalar-, vector-, or tensor-valued) function on a coarse regular grid with $n$ cores, constructs a finer-scale version of the same function represented by a TT with $n+m$ cores, where the last $m$ cores maintain constant rank. Our method guarantees a $\ell^{2}$-norm error bound independent of the total number of cores, achieves exponential compression at fixed accuracy, and admits logarithmic complexity with respect of the number of grid points. We validate its performance through numerical experiments, including 1D, 2D, and 3D applications such as: 2D and 3D airfoil mask embeddings, image super-resolution, and synthetic noise fields such as 3D synthetic turbulence. In particular, we generate fractal noise fields directly in TT format with logarithmic complexity and memory. This work opens a path to scalable TT-native solvers with complex geometries and multiscale generative models, with implications from scientific simulation to imaging and real-time graphics.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03885'&gt;arXiv:2601.03885&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 07 Jan 2026 12:54:06 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Stochastic Path Compression for Spectral Tensor Networks on Cyclic Graphs</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Ryan T. Grimm, Joel D. Eaves&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We develop a new approach to compress cyclic tensor networks called stochastic path compression (SPC) that uses an iterative importance sampling procedure to target edges with large bond-dimensions. Closed random walks in SPC form compression pathways that spatially localize large bond-dimensions in the tensor network. Analogous to the phase separation of two immiscible liquids, SPC separates the graph of bond-dimensions into spatially distinct high and low density regions. When combined with our integral decimation algorithm, SPC facilitates the accurate compression of cyclic tensor networks with continuous degrees of freedom. To benchmark and illustrate the methods, we compute the absolute thermodynamics of $q$-state clock models on two-dimensional square lattices and an XY model on a Watts-Strogatz graph, which is a small-world network with random connectivity between spins.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04172'&gt;arXiv:2601.04172&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 07 Jan 2026 18:39:49 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Umberto Borla, Achilleas Lazarides, Christian Groß, Jad C. Halimeh&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; False vacuum decay, which is understood to happen through bubble nucleation, is a prominent phenomenon relevant to elementary particle physics and early-universe cosmology. Understanding its microscopic dynamics in higher spatial dimensions is currently a major challenge and research thrust. Recent advances in numerical techniques allow for the extraction of related signatures in tractable systems in two spatial dimensions over intermediate timescales. Here, we focus on the $2+1$D quantum Ising model, where a longitudinal field is used to energetically separate the two $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry-broken ferromagnetic ground states, turning them into a ``true'' and ``false'' vacuum. Using tree tensor networks, we simulate the microscopic dynamics of a spin-down domain in a spin-up background after a homogeneous quench, with parameters chosen so that the domain corresponds to a bubble of the true vacuum in a false-vacuum background. Our study identifies how the ultimate fate of the bubble -- indefinite expansion or collapse -- depends on its geometrical features and on the microscopic parameters of the Ising Hamiltonian. We further provide a realistic quantum-simulation scheme, aimed at probing bubble dynamics on atomic Rydberg arrays.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04305'&gt;arXiv:2601.04305&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 07 Jan 2026 19:00:00 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Scalable cold-atom quantum simulator of a $3+1$D U$(1)$ lattice gauge theory with dynamical matter</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04345</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Simone Orlando, Guo-Xian Su, Bing Yang, Jad C. Halimeh&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The stated overarching goal of the highly active field of quantum simulation of high-energy physics (HEP) is to achieve the capability to study \textit{ab-initio} real-time microscopic dynamics of $3+1$D quantum chromodynamics (QCD). However, existing experimental realizations and theoretical proposals for future ones have remained restricted to one or two spatial dimensions. Here, we take a big step towards this goal by proposing a concrete experimentally feasible scalable cold-atom quantum simulator of a U$(1)$ quantum link model of quantum electrodynamics (QED) in three spatial dimensions, employing \textit{linear gauge protection} to stabilize gauge invariance. Using tree tensor network simulations, we benchmark the performance of this quantum simulator through near- and far-from-equilibrium observables, showing excellent agreement with the ideal gauge theory. Additionally, we introduce a method for \textit{analog quantum error mitigation} that accounts for unwanted first-order tunneling processes, vastly improving agreement between quantum-simulator and ideal-gauge-theory results. Our findings pave the way towards realistic quantum simulators of $3+1$D lattice gauge theories that can probe regimes well beyond classical simulability.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04345'&gt;arXiv:2601.04345&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 07 Jan 2026 19:32:05 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Implementation of Tensor Network Simulation TN-Sim under NWQ-Sim</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04422</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Aaron C. Hoyt, Jonathan S. Bersson, Sean Garner, Chenxu Liu, Ang Li&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Large-scale tensor network simulations are crucial for developing robust complexity-theoretic bounds on classical quantum simulation, enabling circuit cutting approaches, and optimizing circuit compilation, all of which aid efficient quantum computation on limited quantum resources. Modern exascale high-performance computing platforms offer significant potential for advancing tensor network quantum circuit simulation capabilities. We implement TN-Sim, a tensor network simulator backend within the NWQ-Sim software package that utilizes the Tensor Algebra for Many-body Methods (TAMM) framework to support both distributed HPC-scale computations and local simulations with ITensor. To optimize the scale up in computation across multiple nodes we implement a task based parallelization scheme to demonstrate parallelized gate contraction for wide quantum circuits with many gates per layer. Through the integration of the TAMM framework with Matrix Product State (MPS) tensor network approaches, we deliver a simulation environment that can scale from local systems to HPC clusters. We demonstrate an MPS tensor network simulator running on the state-of-the-art Perlmutter (NVIDIA) supercomputer and discuss the potential portability of this software to HPC clusters such as Frontier (AMD) and Aurora (Intel). We also discuss future improvements including support for different tensor network topologies and enhanced computational efficiency.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04422'&gt;arXiv:2601.04422&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 07 Jan 2026 22:01:35 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

Price, Qing Yao&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We re-visit the pentagon holographic quantum error correcting code from a ZX-calculus perspective. By expressing the underlying tensors as ZX-diagrams, we study the stabiliser structure of the code via Pauli webs. In addition, we obtain a diagrammatic understanding of its logical operators, encoding isometries, Rényi entropy and toy models of black holes/wormholes. Then, motivated by the pentagon holographic code's ZX-diagram, we introduce a family of codes constructed from ZX-diagrams on its dual hyperbolic tessellations and study their logical error rates using belief propagation decoders.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04467'&gt;arXiv:2601.04467&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 08 Jan 2026 01:00:45 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Probing quantum critical crossover via impurity renormalization group</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04729</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Tao Yang, Z. Y. Xie, Rui Wang, Baigeng Wang&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Quantum impurities can host exotic many-body states that serve as sensitive probes of bath correlations. However, quantitative and non-perturbative methods for determining impurity thermodynamics in such settings remain scarce. Here, we introduce an impurity renormalization group approach that merges the tensor-network representation with the numerical renormalization group cutoff scheme. This method overcomes conventional limitations by treating bath correlations and impurity interactions on an equal footing. Applying our approach to the finite-temperature quantum critical regime of quantum spin systems, we uncover striking impurity-induced phenomena. In a coupled Heisenberg ladder, the impurity triggers a fractionalization of the local magnetic moment. Moreover, the derivative of the impurity susceptibility develops cusps that mark the crossover into the quantum critical regime. We also observe an exotic evolution of the spin correlation function driven by the interplay between bath correlations and the impurity. Our results demonstrate that this method can efficiently solve correlated systems with defects, opening new pathways to discovering novel impurity physics beyond those in non-interacting thermal baths.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04729'&gt;arXiv:2601.04729&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 08 Jan 2026 08:48:12 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Simulation of noisy quantum circuits using frame representations</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05131</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Janek Denzler, Jose Carrasco, Jens Eisert, Tommaso Guaita&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; One of the core research questions in the theory of quantum computing is to find out to what precise extent the classical simulation of a noisy quantum circuits is possible and where potential quantum advantages can set in. In this work, we introduce a unified framework for the classical simulation of quantum circuits based on frame theory, encompassing and generalizing a broad class of existing simulation strategies. Within this framework, the computational cost of a simulation algorithm is determined by the one-norm of an associated quasi-probability distribution, providing a common quantitative measure across different simulation approaches. This enables a comprehensive perspective on common methods for the simulation of noisy circuits based on different quantum resources, such as entanglement or non-stabilizerness. It further provides a clear scheme for generating novel classical simulation algorithms. Indeed, by exploring different choices of frames within this formalism and resorting to tools of convex optimization, we are able not only to obtain new insights and improved bounds for existing methods -- such as stabilizer state simulation or Pauli back-propagation -- but also to discover a new approach with an improved performance based on a generalization of the Pauli frame. We, thereby, show that classical simulation techniques can directly benefit from a perspective -- that of frames -- that goes beyond the traditional classification of quantum resources.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05131'&gt;arXiv:2601.05131&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 08 Jan 2026 17:20:49 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Chiral Graviton Modes in Fermionic Fractional Chern Insulators</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05196</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Min Long, Zeno Bacciconi, Hongyu Lu, Hernan B. Xavier, Zi Yang Meng, Marcello Dalmonte&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Chiral graviton modes are hallmark collective excitations of Fractional Quantum Hall (FQH) liquids. However, their existence on the lattice, where continuum symmetries that protect them from decay are lost, is still an open and urgent question, especially considering the recent advances in the realization of Fractional Chern Insulators (FCI) in transition metal dichalcogenides and rhombohedral pentalayer graphene. Here we present a comprehensive theoretical and numerical study of graviton-modes in fermionic FCI, and thoroughly demonstrate their existence. We first derive a lattice stress tensor operator in the context of the fermionic Harper-Hofstadter(HH) model which captures the graviton in the flat band limit. Importantly, we discover that such lattice stress-tensor operators are deeply connected to lattice quadrupolar density correlators, readily generalizable to generic Chern bands. We then explicitly show the adiabatic connection between FQH and FCI chiral graviton modes by interpolating from a low flux HH model to a Checkerboard lattice model that hosts a topological flat band. In particular, using state-of-the-art matrix product state and exact diagonalization simulations, we provide strong evidence that chiral graviton modes are long-lived excitations in FCIs despite the lack of continuous symmetries and the scattering with a two-magnetoroton continuum. By means of a careful finite-size analysis, we show that the lattice generates a finite but small intrinsic decay rate for the graviton mode. We discuss the relevance of our results for the exploration of graviton modes in FCI phases realized in solid state settings, as well as cold atom experiments.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05196'&gt;arXiv:2601.05196&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 08 Jan 2026 18:18:45 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Interacting electrons in silicon quantum interconnects</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05306</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Anantha S. Rao, Christopher David White, Sean R. Muleady, Anthony Sigillito, Michael J. Gullans&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Coherent interconnects between gate-defined silicon quantum processing units are essential for scalable quantum computation and long-range entanglement. We argue that one-dimensional electron channels formed in the silicon quantum well of a Si/SiGe heterostructure exhibit strong Coulomb interactions and realize strongly interacting Luttinger liquid physics. At low electron densities, the system enters a Wigner regime characterized by dominant 4kF correlations; increasing the electron density leads to a crossover from the Wigner regime to a Friedel regime with dominant 2kF correlations. We support these results through large-scale density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations of the interacting ground state under both screened and unscreened Coulomb potentials. We propose experimental signatures of the Wigner-Friedel crossover via charge transport and charge sensing in both zero- and high-magnetic field limits. We also analyze the impact of short-range correlated disorder - including random alloy fluctuations and valley splitting variations - and identify that the Wigner-Friedel crossover remains robust until disorder levels of about 400 micro eV. Finally, we show that the Wigner regime enables long-range capacitive coupling between quantum dots across the interconnect, suggesting a route to create long-range entanglement between solid-state qubits. Our results position silicon interconnects as a platform for studying Luttinger liquid physics and for enabling architectures supporting nonlocal quantum error correction and quantum simulation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05306'&gt;arXiv:2601.05306&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 08 Jan 2026 18:44:46 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Continual Quantum Architecture Search with Tensor-Train Encoding: Theory and Applications to Signal Processing</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06392</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Jun Qi, Chao-Han Huck Yang, Pin-Yu Chen, Javier Tejedor, Ling Li, Min-Hsiu Hsieh&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We introduce CL-QAS, a continual quantum architecture search framework that mitigates the challenges of costly amplitude encoding and catastrophic forgetting in variational quantum circuits. The method uses Tensor-Train encoding to efficiently compress high-dimensional stochastic signals into low-rank quantum feature representations. A bi-loop learning strategy separates circuit parameter optimization from architecture exploration, while an Elastic Weight Consolidation regularization ensures stability across sequential tasks. We derive theoretical upper bounds on approximation, generalization, and robustness under quantum noise, demonstrating that CL-QAS achieves controllable expressivity, sample-efficient generalization, and smooth convergence without barren plateaus. Empirical evaluations on electrocardiogram (ECG)-based signal classification and financial time-series forecasting confirm substantial improvements in accuracy, balanced accuracy, F1 score, and reward. CL-QAS maintains strong forward and backward transfer and exhibits bounded degradation under depolarizing and readout noise, highlighting its potential for adaptive, noise-resilient quantum learning on near-term devices.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06392'&gt;arXiv:2601.06392&lt;/a&gt;] Published Sat, 10 Jan 2026 02:36:03 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Topological $Z_4$ spin-orbital liquid on the honeycomb lattice</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06549</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Masahiko G. Yamada&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The density matrix renormalisation group (DMRG) is one of the most powerful numerical methods for strongly correlated condensed matter systems. We extend DMRG to the case with the $\mathrm{SU}(N_c)$ symmetry with $N_c &gt; 2$, including two-dimensional systems. As a killer application, we simulate the ground state of the $\mathrm{SU}(4)$ Heisenberg model on the honeycomb lattice, which can potentially be realised in cold atomic systems and solid state systems like $α$-ZrCl$_3$. We keep up to 12800 $\mathrm{SU}(4)$ states equivalent to more than a million $\mathrm{U}(1)$ states. This supermassive DMRG simulation reveals the quantum spin-orbital liquid ground state, which has been conjectured for more than a decade. The methodology developed here can be extended to any classical Lie groups, paving the way to a next-generation DMRG with a full symmetry implementation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06549'&gt;arXiv:2601.06549&lt;/a&gt;] Published Sat, 10 Jan 2026 12:17:57 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Artificial Entanglement in the Fine-Tuning of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06788</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Min Chen, Zihan Wang, Canyu Chen, Zeguan Wu, Manling Li, Junyu Liu&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Large language models (LLMs) can be adapted to new tasks using parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods that modify only a small number of trainable parameters, often through low-rank updates. In this work, we adopt a quantum-information-inspired perspective to understand their effectiveness. From this perspective, low-rank parameterizations naturally correspond to low-dimensional Matrix Product States (MPS) representations, which enable entanglement-based characterizations of parameter structure. Thereby, we term and measure "Artificial Entanglement", defined as the entanglement entropy of the parameters in artificial neural networks (in particular the LLMs). We first study the representative low-rank adaptation (LoRA) PEFT method, alongside full fine-tuning (FFT), using LLaMA models at the 1B and 8B scales trained on the Tulu3 and OpenThoughts3 datasets, and uncover: (i) Internal artificial entanglement in the updates of query and value projection matrices in LoRA follows a volume law with a central suppression (termed as the "Entanglement Valley"), which is sensitive to hyper-parameters and is distinct from that in FFT; (ii) External artificial entanglement in attention matrices, corresponding to token-token correlations in representation space, follows an area law with logarithmic corrections and remains robust to LoRA hyper-parameters and training steps. Drawing a parallel to the No-Hair Theorem in black hole physics, we propose that although LoRA and FFT induce distinct internal entanglement signatures, such differences do not manifest in the attention outputs, suggesting a "no-hair" property that results in the effectiveness of low rank updates. We further provide theoretical support based on random matrix theory, and extend our analysis to an MPS Adaptation PEFT method, which exhibits qualitatively similar behaviors.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06788'&gt;arXiv:2601.06788&lt;/a&gt;] Published Sun, 11 Jan 2026 06:34:50 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Extending the Handover-Iterative VQE to Challenging Strongly Correlated Systems: $N_2$ and Fe-S Cluster</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06935</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Pilsun Yoo, Kyungmin Kim, Eyuel E. Elala, Shane McFarthing, Aidan Pellow, Johanna I. Fuks, Doo Hyung Kang, Pratanphorn Nakliang, Jaewan Kim, Himadri Pathak, Tomonori Shirakawa, Seiji Yunoki, June-Koo Kevin Rhee&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Accurately describing strongly correlated electronic systems remains a central challenge in quantum chemistry, as electron-electron interactions give rise to complex many-body wavefunctions that are difficult to capture with conventional approximations. Classical wavefunction-based approaches, such as the Semistochastic Heat-bath Configuration Interaction (SHCI) and the Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG), currently define the state of the art, systematically converging toward the Full Configuration Interaction (FCI) limit, but at a rapidly increasing computational cost. Quantum computing algorithms promise to alleviate this scaling bottleneck by leveraging entanglement and superposition to represent correlated states more compactly. We introduced the Handover-Iterative Variational Quantum Eigensolver (HI-VQE) as a practical quantum computing algorithm with an iterative "handover" mechanism that dynamically exchanges information between quantum and classical computers, even using Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) computers. In this work, we extend the HI-VQE to benchmark two prototypical strongly correlated systems, the nitrogen molecule $N_2$ and iron-sulfur (Fe-S) cluster, which serve as stringent tests for both classical and quantum electronic-structure methods. By comparing HI-VQE results against Heat-bath Configuration Interaction (HCI) benchmarks, we assess its accuracy, scalability, and ability to capture multireference correlation effects. Achieving quantitative agreement on these canonical systems demonstrates a viable pathway toward quantum-enhanced simulations of complex bioinorganic molecules, catalytic mechanisms, and correlated materials.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06935'&gt;arXiv:2601.06935&lt;/a&gt;] Published Sun, 11 Jan 2026 14:51:51 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Interface roughening in the 3-D Ising model with tensor networks</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07829</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Atsushi Ueda, Lander Burgelman, Luca Tagliacozzo, Laurens Vanderstraeten&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Interfaces in three-dimensional many-body systems can exhibit rich phenomena beyond the corresponding bulk properties. In particular, they can fluctuate and give rise to massless low energy degrees of freedom even in the presence of a gapped bulk. In this work, we present the first tensor-network study of the paradigmatic interface roughening transition of the 3-D Ising model using highly asymmetric lattices that are infinite in the $(xy)$ direction and finite in $z$. By reducing the problem to an effective 2-D tensor network, we study how truncating the $z$ direction reshapes the physics of the interface. For a truncation based on open boundary conditions, we demonstrate that varying the interface width gives rise to either a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry breaking transition (for odd $L_z$) or a smooth crossover(for even $L_z$). For antiperiodic boundary conditions, we obtain an effective $\mathbb{Z}_q$ clock model description with $q=2L_z$ that exhibits an intermediate Luttinger liquid phase with an emergent $\U(1)$ symmetry.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07829'&gt;arXiv:2601.07829&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 12 Jan 2026 18:58:48 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Cost scaling of MPS and TTNS simulations for 2D and 3D systems with area-law entanglement</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08132</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Thomas Barthel&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Tensor network states are an indispensable tool for the simulation of strongly correlated quantum many-body systems. In recent years, tree tensor network states (TTNS) have been successfully used for two-dimensional systems and to benchmark quantum simulation approaches for condensed matter, nuclear, and particle physics. In comparison to the more traditional approach based on matrix product states (MPS), the graph distance of physical degrees of freedom can be drastically reduced in TTNS. Surprisingly, it turns out that, for large systems in $D&gt;1$ spatial dimensions, MPS simulations of low-energy states are nevertheless more efficient than TTNS simulations. With a focus on $D=2$ and 3, the scaling of computational costs for different boundary conditions is determined under the assumption that the system obeys an entanglement (log-)area law, implying that bond dimensions scale exponentially in the surface area of the associated subsystems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08132'&gt;arXiv:2601.08132&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 13 Jan 2026 01:53:01 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Generalized cluster states in 2+1d: non-invertible symmetries, interfaces, and parameterized families</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08615</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Kansei Inamura, Shuhei Ohyama&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We construct 2+1-dimensional lattice models of symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases with non-invertible symmetries and investigate their properties using tensor networks. These models, which we refer to as generalized cluster models, are constructed by gauging a subgroup symmetry $H \subset G$ in models with a finite group 0-form symmetry $G$. By construction, these models have a non-invertible symmetry described by the group-theoretical fusion 2-category $\mathcal{C}(G; H)$. After identifying the tensor network representations of the symmetry operators, we study the symmetry acting on the interface between two generalized cluster states. In particular, we will see that the symmetry at the interface is described by a multifusion category known as the strip 2-algebra. By studying possible interface modes allowed by this symmetry, we show that the interface between generalized cluster states in different SPT phases must be degenerate. This result generalizes the ordinary bulk-boundary correspondence. Furthermore, we construct parameterized families of generalized cluster states and study the topological charge pumping phenomena, known as the generalized Thouless pump. We exemplify our construction with several concrete cases, and compare them with known phases, such as SPT phases with $2\mathrm{Rep}((\mathbb{Z}_{2}^{[1]}\times\mathbb{Z}_{2}^{[1]})\rtimes\mathbb{Z}_{2}^{[0]})$ symmetry.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08615'&gt;arXiv:2601.08615&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 13 Jan 2026 15:00:00 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Probing the Dynamical Structure Factor of Quantum Spin Chains via Low-Temperature Gibbs States with Matrix Product State Subspace Expansion</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09326</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Tomoya Takahashi, Wei-Lin Tu, Ji-Yao Chen, Yusuke Nomura&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Studying finite-temperature properties with tensor networks is notoriously difficult, especially at low temperatures, due to the rapid growth of entanglement and the complexity of thermal states. Existing methods like purification and minimally entangled typical thermal states offer partial solutions but struggle with scalability and accuracy in low-temperature regime. To overcome these limitations, we propose a new approach based on generating-function matrix product states (GFMPS). By directly computing a large set of Bloch-type excited states, we construct Gibbs states that moderate the area-law constraint, enabling accurate and efficient approximation of low-temperature thermal behavior. Our benchmark results show magnificent agreement with both exact diagonalization and experimental observations, validating the accuracy of our approach. This method offers a promising new direction for overcoming the longstanding challenges of studying low-temperature properties within the tensor network framework. We also expect that our method will facilitate the numerical simulation of quantum materials in comparison with experimental observations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09326'&gt;arXiv:2601.09326&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 14 Jan 2026 10:00:20 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Lattice fermion simulation of spontaneous time-reversal symmetry breaking in a helical Luttinger liquid</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; V. A. Zakharov, J. Sánchez Fernán, C. W. J. Beenakker&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We extend a recently developed "tangent fermion" method to discretize the Hamiltonian of a helical Luttinger liquid on a one-dimensional lattice, including two-particle backscattering processes that may open a gap in the spectrum. The fermion-doubling obstruction of the sine dispersion is avoided by working with a tangent dispersion, preserving the time-reversal symmetry of the Hamiltonian. The numerical results from a tensor network calculation on a finite lattice confirm the expectation from infinite-system analytics, that a gapped phase with spontaneously broken time-reversal symmetry emerges when the Fermi level is tuned to the Dirac point and the Luttinger parameter crosses a critical value.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09563'&gt;arXiv:2601.09563&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 14 Jan 2026 15:32:20 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Matrix product operator representations for the local conserved quantities of the spin-$1/2$ XYZ chain</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Kohei Fukai, Kyoichi Yamada&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We present explicit matrix product operator (MPO) representations for the local conserved quantities of the spin-$1/2$ XYZ chain. Through these MPO representations, we simplify the coefficients appearing in the local conserved quantities originally derived by one of the authors, and reveal their combinatorial meaning: the coefficients prove to be a polynomial generalization of the Catalan numbers, defined via weighted monotonic lattice paths. Furthermore, we obtain a new simple $3 \times 3$ Lax operator for the XYZ chain that, unlike Baxter's R-matrix, does not involve elliptic functions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09245'&gt;arXiv:2601.09245&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 14 Jan 2026 07:27:49 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Privacy Enhanced PEFT: Tensor Train Decomposition Improves Privacy Utility Tradeoffs under DP-SGD</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10045</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Pradip Kunwar, Minh Vu, Maanak Gupta, Manish Bhattarai&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Fine-tuning large language models on sensitive data poses significant privacy risks, as membership inference attacks can reveal whether individual records were used during training. While Differential Privacy (DP) provides formal protection, applying DP to conventional Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) often incurs substantial utility loss. In this work, we show that a more structurally constrained PEFT architecture, Tensor Train Low-Rank Adaptation (TTLoRA), can improve the privacy-utility tradeoff by shrinking the effective parameter space while preserving expressivity. To this end, we develop TTLoRA-DP, a differentially private training framework for TTLoRA. Specifically, we extend the ghost clipping algorithm to Tensor Train cores via cached contraction states, enabling efficient Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent (DP-SGD) with exact per-example gradient norm computation without materializing full per-example gradients. Experiments on GPT-2 fine-tuning over the Enron and Penn Treebank datasets show that TTLoRA-DP consistently strengthens privacy protection relative to LoRA-DP while maintaining comparable or better downstream utility. Moreover, TTLoRA exhibits lower membership leakage even without DP training, using substantially smaller adapters and requiring on average 7.6X fewer parameters than LoRA. Overall, our results demonstrate that TTLoRA offers a practical path to improving the privacy-utility tradeoff in parameter-efficient language model adaptation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10045'&gt;arXiv:2601.10045&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 15 Jan 2026 03:41:52 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Wang Yang, Helin Wang, Chao Xu&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We perform a systematic study on the effects of electric fields in the Luttinger liquid phase of the one-dimensional spin-$1/2$ $K_1J_1Γ_1Γ_1^\prime K_2J_2$ model in the region of ferromagnetic nearest-neighboring Kitaev coupling. We find that while electric fields along $(1,1,1)$-direction maintain the Luttinger liquid behavior, fields along other directions drive the system to a dimerized state. An estimation is made on how effective a $(1,1,1)$-field is for tuning the Luttinger parameter in real materials. Our work is useful for understanding the effects of electric fields in one-dimensional generalized Kitaev spin models, and provides a starting point for exploring the electric-field-related physics in two dimensions based on a quasi-one-dimensional approach.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10158'&gt;arXiv:2601.10158&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 15 Jan 2026 07:58:10 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Autonomous Quantum Simulation through Large Language Model Agents</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10194</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Weitang Li, Jiajun Ren, Lixue Cheng, Cunxi Gong&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We demonstrate that large language model (LLM) agents can autonomously perform tensor network simulations of quantum many-body systems, achieving approximately 90% success rate across representative benchmark tasks. Tensor network methods are powerful tools for quantum simulation, but their effective use requires expertise typically acquired through years of graduate training. By combining in-context learning with curated documentation and multi-agent decomposition, we create autonomous AI agents that can be trained in specialized computational domains within minutes. We benchmark three configurations (baseline, single-agent with in-context learning, and multi-agent with in-context learning) on problems spanning quantum phase transitions, open quantum system dynamics, and photochemical reactions. Systematic evaluation using DeepSeek-V3.2, Gemini 2.5 Pro, and Claude Opus 4.5 demonstrates that both in-context learning and multi-agent architecture are essential. Analysis of failure modes reveals characteristic patterns across models, with the multi-agent configuration substantially reducing implementation errors and hallucinations compared to simpler architectures.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10194'&gt;arXiv:2601.10194&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 15 Jan 2026 08:50:57 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Quantitative approach for the Dicke-Ising chain with an effective self-consistent matter Hamiltonian</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10210</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; J. Leibig, M. Hörmann, A. Langheld, A. Schellenberger, K. P. Schmidt&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; In the thermodynamic limit, the Dicke-Ising chain maps exactly onto an effective self-consistent matter Hamiltonian with the photon field acting solely as a self-consistent effective field. As a consequence, no quantum correlations between photons and spins are needed to understand the quantum phase diagram. This enables us to determine the quantum phase diagram in the thermodynamic limit using numerical linked-cluster expansions combined with density matrix renormalization group calculations (NLCE+DMRG) to solve the resulting self-consistent matter Hamiltonian. This includes magnetically ordered phases with significantly improved accuracy compared to previous estimates. For ferromagnetic Ising couplings, we refine the location of the multicritical point governing the change in the order of the superradiant phase transition, reaching a relative accuracy of $10^{-4}$. For antiferromagnetic Ising couplings, we confirm the existence of the narrow antiferromagnetic superradiant phase in the thermodynamic limit. The effective matter Hamiltonian framework identifies the antiferromagnetic superradiant phase as the many-body ground state of an antiferromagnetic transverse-field Ising model with longitudinal field. This phase emerges through continuous Dicke-type polariton condensation from the antiferromagnetic normal phase, followed by a first-order transition to the paramagnetic superradiant phase. Thus, NLCE+DMRG provides a precise determination of the Dicke-Ising phase diagram in one dimension by solving the self-consistent effective matter Hamiltonian.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10210'&gt;arXiv:2601.10210&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 15 Jan 2026 09:21:40 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>The SpinPulse library for transpilation and noise-accurate simulation of spin qubit quantum computers</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10435</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Benoît Vermersch, Oscar Gravier, Nathan Miscopein, Julia Guignon, Carlos Ramos Marimón, Jonathan Durandau, Matthieu Dartiailh, Tristan Meunier, Valentin Savin&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We introduce SpinPulse, an open-source python package for simulating spin qubit-based quantum computers at the pulse-level. SpinPulse models the specific physics of spin qubits, particularly through the inclusion of classical non-Markovian noise. This enables realistic simulations of native gates and quantum circuits, in order to support hardware development. In SpinPulse, a quantum circuit is first transpiled into the native gate set of our model and then converted to a pulse sequence. This pulse sequence is subsequently integrated numerically in the presence of a simulated noisy experimental environment. We showcase workflows including transpilation, pulse-level compilation, hardware benchmarking, quantum error mitigation, and large-scale simulations via integration with the tensor-network library quimb. We expect SpinPulse to be a valuable open-source tool for the quantum computing community, fostering efforts to devise high-fidelity quantum circuits and improved strategies for quantum error mitigation and correction.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10435'&gt;arXiv:2601.10435&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 15 Jan 2026 14:29:24 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Magnetic field-induced phases in a model S=1 Haldane chain system</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; I. Jakovac, M. S. Grbić, M. Dupont, N. Laflorencie, S. Capponi, Y. Hosokoshi, S. Krämer, Y. Skourski, S. Luther M. Takigawa, M. Horvatić&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; An $S=1$ Haldane chain is a one-dimensional (1D) quantum magnet where strong fluctuations result in quantum disordered singlet ground state with a gapped excitation spectrum. The gap magnitude is primarily set by the dominant intrachain interaction ($J_\text{1D}$). An applied magnetic field closes the gap at $B_\text{c1}$ and drives the system into a gapless Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid (TLL) regime, followed by, at lower temperatures, a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) ground state, persisting up to $B_\text{c2} \propto 4 J_\text{1D}/gμ_B$. Almost all previously studied experimental realizations of such systems were based on transition-metal complexes which typically suffer from intrinsic anisotropies or large $J_\text{1D}$ values, limiting the access to the full theoretical phase diagram. We report a comprehensive study of TLL and BEC phases in the organic Haldane chain system 3,5-bis(N-tert-butylaminoxyl)-3'-nitrobiphenyl (BoNO). The absence of anisotropy and a moderate $J_\text{1D}$ enable exploration of the complete $B-T$ phase diagram. Through $^1$H nuclear magnetic resonance, combined with theoretical analysis, we characterize the TLL properties, map the BEC phase boundary $T_c (B)$, determine the associated critical exponent $ν\approx 0.66$ at $B_\text{c2}$, and demonstrate universal quasiparticle scaling in the quantum-critical regime. These results provide full experimental validation of theoretical predictions for field-induced phases in an $S=1$ Haldane chain, made over two decades ago.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10489'&gt;arXiv:2601.10489&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 15 Jan 2026 15:11:26 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Towards Tensor Network Models for Low-Latency Jet Tagging on FPGAs</title>

Motivated by the strict requirements of the HL-LHC Level-1 trigger system, we explore TNs as compact and interpretable alternatives to deep neural networks. Using low-level jet constituent features, our models achieve competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art deep learning classifiers. We investigate post-training quantization to enable hardware-efficient implementations without degrading classification performance or latency. The best-performing models are synthesized to estimate FPGA resource usage, latency, and memory occupancy, demonstrating sub-microsecond latency and supporting the feasibility of online deployment in real-time trigger systems. Overall, this study highlights the potential of TN-based models for fast and resource-efficient inference in low-latency environments.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10801'&gt;arXiv:2601.10801&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 15 Jan 2026 19:04:49 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Pathway to Kondo physics in ytterbium atom chains with repulsive spin impurities</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11449</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Jeff Maki, Lidia Stocker, Oded Zilberberg&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The Kondo effect is a paradigmatic model of strongly-correlated physics, where a magnetic impurity forms a many-body singlet with a fermionic environment. Cold gases of ytterbium (Yb) atoms have been proposed to be an ideal platform to study the Kondo effect since different internal states of the atom can be used to create both the impurity and the fermionic environment. In Yb gases, however, the atomic impurity interacts with the fermionic environment both through magnetic and potential scattering. These two scattering mechanisms counteract one another, raising the question of how robust Kondo screening remains. Here, we show that potential scattering can quench the Kondo screening in one-dimensional Yb gases; yet, strikingly, Kondo physics survives this quench in well-defined regimes. Combining analytical renormalization-group theory for a Luttinger liquid with density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations, we identify a transition from a strongly- to a weakly-entangled impurity as potential scattering is increased. The two approaches show excellent agreement concerning the stability of Kondo physics throughout the different parameter regimes considered. Our results provide a quantitative criterion for the emergence of Kondo screening in one-dimensional Yb gases and delineate experimentally accessible regimes for its realization in cold-atom platforms.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11449'&gt;arXiv:2601.11449&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 16 Jan 2026 17:14:17 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

This representation enables the quantitative control of the coefficients of the Laughlin wavefunction times an arbitrary monomial symmetric polynomial when expanded in a Slater determinant or permanent basis. It renders the properties, such as factorization and the renewal structure, inherent in such fractional quantum Hall wavefunctions transparent. We prove bounds on the correlators of the chiral quantum field theory and utilize this representation to demonstrate the exponential decay of connected correlations and a gap in the entanglement spectrum on a thin cylinder.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12165'&gt;arXiv:2601.12165&lt;/a&gt;] Published Sat, 17 Jan 2026 21:07:27 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>LiQSS: Post-Transformer Linear Quantum-Inspired State-Space Tensor Networks for Real-Time 6G</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12375</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Farhad Rezazadeh, Hatim Chergui, Mehdi Bennis, Houbing Song, Lingjia Liu, Dusit Niyato, Merouane Debbah&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Proactive and agentic control in Sixth-Generation (6G) Open Radio Access Networks (O-RAN) requires control-grade prediction under stringent Near-Real-Time (Near-RT) latency and computational constraints. While Transformer-based models are effective for sequence modeling, their quadratic complexity limits scalability in Near-RT RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC) analytics. This paper investigates a post-Transformer design paradigm for efficient radio telemetry forecasting. We propose a quantum-inspired many-body state-space tensor network that replaces self-attention with stable structured state-space dynamics kernels, enabling linear-time sequence modeling. Tensor-network factorizations in the form of Tensor Train (TT) / Matrix Product State (MPS) representations are employed to reduce parameterization and data movement in both input projections and prediction heads, while lightweight channel gating and mixing layers capture non-stationary cross-Key Performance Indicator (KPI) dependencies. The proposed model is instantiated as an agentic perceive-predict xApp and evaluated on a bespoke O-RAN KPI time-series dataset comprising 59,441 sliding windows across 13 KPIs, using Reference Signal Received Power (RSRP) forecasting as a representative use case. Our proposed Linear Quantum-Inspired State-Space (LiQSS) model is 10.8x-15.8x smaller and approximately 1.4x faster than prior structured state-space baselines. Relative to Transformer-based models, LiQSS achieves up to a 155x reduction in parameter count and up to 2.74x faster inference, without sacrificing forecasting accuracy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12375'&gt;arXiv:2601.12375&lt;/a&gt;] Published Sun, 18 Jan 2026 12:08:38 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Jonnathan Pineda, Mario Collura, Gianluca Passarelli, Procolo Lucignaon, Davide Rossini, Angelo Russomanno&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We investigate operator delocalization in disordered one-dimensional spin chains by introducing -- besides the already known operator mass -- a complementary measure of operator complexity: the operator length. Like the operator nonstabilizerness, both these quantities are defined from the expansion of time-evolved operators in the Pauli basis. They characterize, respectively, the number of sites on which an operator acts nontrivially and the spatial extent of its support. We show that both the operator mass and length can be computed efficiently and exactly within a matrix-product-operator (MPS) framework, providing direct access to their full probability distributions, without resorting to stochastic sampling. Applying this approach to the disordered XXZ spin-1/2 chain, we find sharply distinct behaviors in non-interacting and interacting regimes. In the Anderson-localized case, operator mass, length, and operator entanglement entropy rapidly saturate, signaling the absence of scrambling. By contrast, in the many-body localized (MBL) regime, for arbitrarily weak interactions, all quantities exhibit a robust logarithmic growth in time, consistent with the known logarithmic light cone of quantum-correlation propagation in MBL. We demonstrate that this behavior is quantitatively captured by an effective $\ell$-bit model and persists across system sizes accessible via tensor-network simulations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12446'&gt;arXiv:2601.12446&lt;/a&gt;] Published Sun, 18 Jan 2026 15:03:25 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Comparison between explicit and implicit discretization strategies for a dissipative thermal environment</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13103</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Xinxian Chen, Ignacio Franco&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We investigate strategies for simulating open quantum systems coupled to dissipative baths by comparing explicit wave function-based discretization [via multi-layer multi-configuration time-dependent Hartree (ML-MCTDH)] and the implicit density matrix-based master equation method [via tree tensor network hierarchical equations of motion (TTN-HEOM)]. For dissipative baths characterized by exponentially decaying bath correlation functions, the implicit discretization approach of HEOM -- rooted in bath correlation function decompositions -- proves significantly more efficient than explicit discretization of the bath into discrete harmonic modes. Explicit methods, like ML-MCTDH, require extensive mode discretization to approximate continuum baths, leading to computational bottlenecks. Case studies for two-level systems and a Fenna--Matthews--Olson complex model highlight TTN-HEOM's superiority in capturing dissipative dynamics with relaxations with a minimal number of auxiliary modes, while the explicit methods are as exact as the HEOM in pure dephasing regimes. This comparison is enabled by the TENSO package, which has both ML-MCTDH and TTN-HEOM implemented using the same computational structure and propagation strategy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13103'&gt;arXiv:2601.13103&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 19 Jan 2026 14:41:19 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Polynomial-time certification of fidelity for many-body mixed states and mixed-state universality classes</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13333</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Yuhan Liu, Yijian Zou&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Computation of Uhlmann fidelity between many-body mixed states generally involves full diagonalization of exponentially large matrices. In this work, we introduce a polynomial-time algorithm to compute certified lower and upper bounds for the fidelity between matrix product density operators (MPDOs). Our method maps the fidelity estimation problem to a variational optimization of sequential quantum circuits, allowing for systematic improvement of the lower bounds by increasing the circuit depth. Complementarily, we obtain certified upper bounds on fidelity by variational lower bounds on the trace distance through the same framework. We demonstrate the power of this approach with two examples: fidelity correlators in critical mixed states, and codeword distinguishability in an approximate quantum error-correcting code. Remarkably, the variational lower bound accurately track the universal scaling behavior of the fidelity with a size-consistent relative error, allowing for the extraction of previously unknown critical exponents. Our results offer an exponential improvement in precision over known moment-based bounds and establish a scalable framework for the verification of many-body quantum systems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13333'&gt;arXiv:2601.13333&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 19 Jan 2026 19:13:28 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Onset of thermalization of q-deformed SU(2) Yang-Mills theory on a trapped-ion quantum computer</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13530</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Tomoya Hayata, Yoshimasa Hidaka, Yuta Kikuchi&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Nonequilibrium dynamics of quantum many-body systems is one of the main targets of quantum simulations. This focus - together with rapid advances in quantum-computing hardware - has driven increasing applications in high-energy physics, particularly in lattice gauge theories. However, most existing experimental demonstrations remain restricted to (1+1)-dimensional and/or abelian gauge theories, such as the Schwinger model and the toric code. It is essential to develop quantum simulations of nonabelian gauge theories in higher dimensions, addressing realistic problems in high-energy physics. To fill the gap, we demonstrate a quantum simulation of thermalization dynamics in a (2+1)-dimensional $q$-deformed $\mathrm{SU}(2)_3$ Yang-Mills theory using a trapped-ion quantum computer. By restricting the irreducible representations of the gauge fields to the integer-spin sector of $\mathrm{SU}(2)_3$, we obtain a simplified yet nontrivial model described by Fibonacci anyons, which preserves the essential nonabelian fusion structure of the gauge fields. We successfully simulate the real-time dynamics of this model using quantum circuits that explicitly implement $F$-moves. In our demonstrations, the quantum circuits execute up to 47 sequential $F$-moves. We identify idling errors as the dominant error source, which can be effectively mitigated using dynamical decoupling combined with a parallelized implementation of $F$-moves.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13530'&gt;arXiv:2601.13530&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 20 Jan 2026 02:25:53 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>On the Optimal Layout of Two-Dimensional Lattices for Density Matrix Renormalization Group</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; A. Scardicchio&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; For quantum spin models defined on a two-dimensional lattice, we look for the best numbering of the lattice sites (a layout) that, at fixed bond dimension and other parameters of the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) algorithm, gives the lowest value of the variational energy, maximum entropy and truncation error. We consider the conjecture that the optimal layout is a Hamiltonian path, and that it optimizes a simply computable geometric cost function. Finding the minimum of such a function, which is a variant of the minimum linear arrangement problem, provides the DMRG with an efficient layout of the lattice and improves both accuracy and convergence time. We present applications to the antiferromagnetic and spin glass spin-1/2 models on the square and triangular lattices.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13762'&gt;arXiv:2601.13762&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 20 Jan 2026 09:12:45 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

Employing matrix-product-state-based methods, we compute the single-particle spectrum and optical conductivity in a correlated two-band model. Our numerical calculation reveals the emergence of a correlation-driven in-gap branch in the doped state. The origin of the in-gap branch is examined by decomposing the propagation dynamics of a single particle, elucidating that the doping-induced branch is associated with excitonic correlations. Our demonstrations suggest that the doping-induced branch can serve as an indicator of electron-hole correlations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13890'&gt;arXiv:2601.13890&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 20 Jan 2026 12:09:05 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Tensor Network Assisted Distributed Variational Quantum Algorithm for Large Scale Combinatorial Optimization Problem</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13956</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Yuhan Huang, Siyuan Jin, Yichi Zhang, Qi Zhao, Jun Qi, Qiming Shao&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Although quantum computing holds promise for solving Combinatorial Optimization Problems (COPs), the limited qubit capacity of NISQ hardware makes large-scale instances intractable. Conventional methods attempt to bridge this gap through decomposition or compression, yet they frequently fail to capture global correlations of subsystems, leading to solutions of limited quality. We propose the Distributed Variational Quantum Algorithm (DVQA) to overcome these limitations, enabling the solution of 1,000-variable instances on constrained hardware. A key innovation of DVQA is its use of the truncated higher-order singular value decomposition to preserve inter-variable dependencies without relying on complex long-range entanglement, leading to a natural form of noise localization where errors scale with subsystem size rather than total qubit count, thus reconciling scalability with accuracy. Theoretical bounds confirm the algorithm's robustness for p-local Hamiltonians. Empirically, DVQA achieves state-of-the-art performance in simulations and has been experimentally validated on the Wu Kong quantum computer for portfolio optimization. This work provides a scalable, noise-resilient framework that advances the timeline for practical quantum optimization algorithms.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13956'&gt;arXiv:2601.13956&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 20 Jan 2026 13:31:02 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Vanishing correlations in (bi)stochastic controlled circuits</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Pavel Kos, Bruno Bertini, Tomaž Prosen&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We study the dynamics of circuits composed of stochastic and bistochastic controlled gates. This type of dynamics arises from quantum circuits with random controlled gates, as well as in stochastic circuits and deterministic classical cellular automata. We prove that stochastic and bistochastic controlled gates lead to two-point spatio-temporal correlation functions that vanish everywhere except when the two operators act on the same site. More generally, for multi-point correlations the two rightmost operators must act on the same site. We argue that autocorrelation, while hard to compute, typically decays exponentially towards a value that is exponentially small in the system size. Our results reveal a broad class of quantum systems that exhibit surprisingly simple correlation structures despite their complex microscopic dynamics.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14379'&gt;arXiv:2601.14379&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 20 Jan 2026 19:00:05 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

We focus on the highly frustrated regime around $J_2 \approx J_1/2$. The $h$-$T$ phase diagram is investigated with particular emphasis on the finite-temperature transition into the "up-up-up-down" state that is stabilized by thermal and quantum fluctuations and manifests itself as a plateau at one half of the saturation magnetization in the quantum case. We also discuss the enhanced magnetocaloric effect associated to the ground-state degeneracy that arises at the saturation field for $J_2=J_1/2$. For reference, we first study the classical case by classical Monte Carlo simulations. Then we turn to the extreme quantum limit of spin-1/2 where we perform zero- and finite-temperature Lanczos calculations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14380'&gt;arXiv:2601.14380&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 20 Jan 2026 19:00:05 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Quadratic tensors as a unification of Clifford, Gaussian, and free-fermion physics</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15396</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Andreas Bauer, Seth Lloyd&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Certain families of quantum mechanical models can be described and solved efficiently on a classical computer, including qubit or qudit Clifford circuits and stabilizer codes, free-boson or free-fermion models, and certain rotor and GKP codes. We show that all of these families can be described as instances of the same algebraic structure, namely quadratic functions over abelian groups, or more generally over (super) Hopf algebras. Different kinds of degrees of freedom correspond to different "elementary" abelian groups or Hopf algebras: $\mathbb{Z}_2$ for qubits, $\mathbb{Z}_d$ for qudits, $\mathbb{R}$ for continuous variables, both $\mathbb{Z}$ and $\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}$ for rotors, and a super Hopf algebra $\mathcal F$ for fermionic modes. Objects such as states, operators, superoperators, or projection-operator valued measures, etc, are tensors. For the solvable models above, these tensors are quadratic tensors based on quadratic functions. Quadratic tensors with $n$ degrees of freedom are fully specified by only $O(n^2)$ coefficients. Tensor networks of quadratic tensors can be contracted efficiently on the level of these coefficients, using an operation reminiscent of the Schur complement. Our formalism naturally includes models with mixed degrees of freedom, such as qudits of different dimensions. We also use quadratic functions to define generalized stabilizer codes and Clifford gates for arbitrary abelian groups. Finally, we give a generalization from quadratic (or 2nd order) to $i$th order tensors, which are specified by $O(nî)$ coefficients but cannot be contracted efficiently in general.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15396'&gt;arXiv:2601.15396&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 21 Jan 2026 19:07:27 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

In this work, we introduce a tensor network formalism, which captures sparsity principles originating in the different approaches in tensor decompositions. In particular, we describe a basis encoding scheme for functions and model neural decompositions as tensor decompositions. The proposed formalism can be applied to represent logical formulas and probability distributions as structured tensor decompositions. This unified treatment identifies tensor network contractions as a fundamental inference class and formulates efficiently scaling reasoning algorithms, originating from probability theory and propositional logic, as contraction message passing schemes. The framework enables the definition and training of hybrid logical and probabilistic models, which we call Hybrid Logic Network. The theoretical concepts are accompanied by the python library tnreason, which enables the implementation and practical use of the proposed architectures.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15442'&gt;arXiv:2601.15442&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 21 Jan 2026 20:20:31 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Tensor-based phase difference estimation on time series analysis</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15616</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Shu Kanno, Kenji Sugisaki, Rei Sakuma, Jumpei Kato, Hajime Nakamura, Naoki Yamamoto&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We propose a phase-difference estimation algorithm based on the tensor-network circuit compression, leveraging time-evolution data to pursue scalability and higher accuracy on a quantum phase estimation (QPE)-type algorithm. Using tensor networks, we construct circuits composed solely of nearest-neighbor gates and extract time-evolution data by four-type circuit measurements. In addition, to enhance the accuracy of time-evolution and state-preparation circuits, we propose techniques based on algorithmic error mitigation and on iterative circuit optimization combined with merging into matrix product states, respectively. Verifications using a noiseless simulator for the 8-qubit one-dimensional Hubbard model using an ancilla qubit show that the proposed algorithm achieves accuracies with 0.4--4.7\% error from a true energy gap on an appropriate time-step size, and that accuracy improvements due to the algorithmic error mitigation are observed. We also confirm the enhancement of the overlap with matrix product states through iterative optimization. Finally, the proposed algorithm is demonstrated on IBM Heron devices with Q-CTRL error suppression for 8-, 36-, and 52-qubit models using more than 5,000 2-qubit gates. These largest-scale demonstrations for the QPE-type algorithm represent significant progress not only toward practical applications of near-term quantum computing but also toward preparation for the era of error-corrected quantum devices.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15616'&gt;arXiv:2601.15616&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 22 Jan 2026 03:42:24 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Phase structure of lattice QCD in the heavy quark high-density region and the three-state Potts model</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15720</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Shinji Ejiri, Masanari Koiida, Toshiki Sato&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We discuss the nature of the QCD phase transition in the heavy quark high-density region by considering an effective theory in which Polyakov loops are dynamical variables. The Polyakov loop is an order parameter of $Z_3$ symmetry, and the fundamental properties of the phase transition are thought to be determined by the $Z_3$ symmetry broken by the phase transition. By replacing the Polyakov loop with $Z_3$ spin, we find that the effective model becomes a three-dimensional three-state Potts model ($Z_3$ spin model) with a complex external field term. We investigate the phase structure of the Potts model and discuss QCD in the heavy quark region. The critical points are determined by finite volume scaling analysis, and in the region where the sign problem is severe, the tensor renormalization group is used to investigate. As the density varies from $μ=0$ to $μ=\infty$, we find that the phase transition is first order in the low-density region, changes to a crossover at the critical point, and then becomes first order again. This strongly suggests the existence of a first order phase transition in the high-density heavy quark region of QCD.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15720'&gt;arXiv:2601.15720&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 22 Jan 2026 07:46:09 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Classical Simulation of Noiseless Quantum Dynamics without Randomness</title>

To close the gap, we propose the Low-weight Pauli Dynamics (LPD) algorithm that efficiently approximates local observables for short-time dynamics in the absence of noise. We prove that the truncation error admits an average-case bound without assuming randomness, provided that the state is sufficiently entangled. Counterintuitively, entanglement--usually an obstacle for classical simulation--alleviates classical simulation error. We further show that such entangled states can be generated either by tensor-network classical simulation or near-term quantum devices. Our results establish a rigorous synergy between existing classical simulation methods and provide a complementary route to quantum simulation that reduces circuit depth for long-time dynamics, thereby extending the accessible regime of quantum dynamics.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15770'&gt;arXiv:2601.15770&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 22 Jan 2026 08:59:57 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Quantum Dimension Reduction of Hidden Markov Models</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Rishi Sundar, Thomas Elliott&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Hidden Markov models (HMMs) are ubiquitous in time-series modelling, with applications ranging from chemical reaction modelling to speech recognition. These HMMs are often large, with high-dimensional memories. A recently-proposed application of quantum technologies is to execute quantum analogues of HMMs. Such quantum HMMs (QHMMs) are strictly more expressive than their classical counterparts, enabling the construction of more parsimonious models of stochastic processes. However, state-of-the-art techniques for QHMM compression, based on tensor networks, are only applicable for a restricted subset of HMMs, where the transitions are deterministic. In this work we introduce a pipeline by which \emph{any} finite, ergodic HMM can be compressed in this manner, providing a route for effective quantum dimension reduction of general HMMs. We demonstrate the method on both a simple toy model, and on a speech-derived HMM trained from data, obtaining favourable memory--accuracy trade-offs compared to classical compression approaches.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16126'&gt;arXiv:2601.16126&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 22 Jan 2026 17:27:52 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Charge and spin orders in the t-U-V-J model: a slave-spin-1 approach</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16153</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Olivier Simard, Michel Ferrero, Thomas Ayral&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Strongly-correlated fermion systems on a lattice have been a subject of intense focus in the field of condensed-matter physics. These systems are notoriously difficult to solve, even with state-of-the-art numerical methods, especially in regimes of parameters where degrees of freedom compete or cooperate at similar energy and length scales. Here, we introduce a spin-1 slave-particle technique to approximately treat the t-U-V-J fermionic model at arbitrary electron dopings in an economical manner. This formalism respectively maps the original charge and spin degrees of freedom into effective pseudo-spin and pseudo-fermion sectors, which are treated using a self-consistent cluster mean-field method. We study the phase diagram of the model under various conditions and report the appearance of charge and spin stripes within this formalism. These stripes are a consequence of the cluster mean-field treatment of the pseudo-particle sectors and have not been detected in previous slave-particle studies. The results obtained agree qualitatively well with what more reliable numerical methods capture.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16153'&gt;arXiv:2601.16153&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 22 Jan 2026 17:55:03 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>String Breaking and Glueball Dynamics in $2+1$D Quantum Link Electrodynamics</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16166</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Jiahao Cao, Rohan Joshi, Yizhuo Tian, N. S. Srivatsa, Jad C. Halimeh&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; At the heart of quark confinement and hadronization, the physics of flux strings has recently become a focal point in the field of quantum simulation of high-energy physics (HEP). Despite considerable progress, a detailed understanding of the behavior of flux strings in quantum simulation-relevant lattice formulations of gauge theories has remained limited to the lowest truncations of the gauge field, which are severely limited in their ability to draw conclusions about the quantum field theory limit. Here, we employ tensor network simulations to investigate the behavior of flux strings in a quantum link formulation of $2+1$D quantum electrodynamics (QED) with a spin-$1$ representation of the gauge field. We first map out the ground-state phase diagram of this model in the presence of two spatially separated static charges, revealing distinct microscopic processes responsible for string breaking, including a two-stage breaking mechanism not possible in the spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ formulation. Starting in different initial product state string configurations, we then explore far-from-equilibrium quench dynamics across various parameter regimes, demonstrating genuine $2+1$D real-time string breaking and glueball-like bound state formation, with the latter not possible in the spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ formulation. In and out of equilibrium, we consider different values and placements of the static charges. Finally, we provide efficient qudit circuits for a quantum simulation experiment in which our results can be observed in state-of-the-art ion-trap setups. Our findings lay the groundwork for quantum simulations of flux strings towards the quantum field theory limit.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16166'&gt;arXiv:2601.16166&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 22 Jan 2026 18:11:29 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>\textit{Ab initio} Gamow density matrix renormalization group for broad nuclear many-body resonances</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16168</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; A. Sehovic, K. Fossez, H. Hergert&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; \textbf{Background} The reach of \textit{ab initio} theory has greatly increased in recent decades. However, predicting the location of the drip lines remains challenging due to uncertainties in nuclear forces and difficulties in describing nuclei that behave as open quantum systems. \textbf{Purpose} In this work, we extend the \textit{ab initio} Gamow Density Matrix Renormalization Group (G-DMRG) approach to the regime of broad many-body resonances to pave the way for systematic tests of nuclear forces in light exotic nuclei. \textbf{Methods} To stabilize calculations, we introduce a new truncation scheme in the reference space, and propose an orbital ordering based on entanglement considerations. We then show how continuum couplings increase entanglement in the many-body problem, and propose a new truncation scheme to stabilize the renormalization and accelerate calculations in extreme conditions. Finally, we demonstrate that natural orbitals can be used to efficiently describe broad resonances by introducing a new ordering scheme and by redefining the reference space based on occupations. \textbf{Results} Leveraging our findings, we propose a recipe to converge \textit{ab initio} G-DMRG calculations and apply it in low-lying states of \isotope[5,6]{He} and \isotope[4]{H}, demonstrating control of the renormalization and the emergence of convergence patterns. We also obtain the first direct \textit{ab initio} calculation of the $J^π= {1/2}^+$ ground state of \isotope[5]{H}. \textbf{Conclusions} We demonstrate that entanglement due to continuum couplings can be controlled in extreme conditions and successfully extend the G-DMRG approach in the regime of broad many-body resonances.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16168'&gt;arXiv:2601.16168&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 22 Jan 2026 18:13:05 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Vacuum structure of gapped QCD$_2$ theories from the infinite Hamiltonian lattice</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Ross Dempsey, Anna-Maria E. Glück, Silviu S. Pufu, Benjamin T. Søgaard&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Gapped two-dimensional gauge theories with massless fermions generically have rich vacuum structures consisting of many degenerate vacua related by the action of topological line operators. The algebra of such operators has been used to calculate ratios of vacuum expectation values of local operators and to predict nontrivial particle-soliton degeneracies. In this paper, we use recently-developed tensor network methods to study several examples of such theories via their Hamiltonian lattice descriptions. Our lattice results agree with all previously-made predictions. Furthermore, we identify the lattice strong-coupling states that can be adiabatically continued to the degenerate vacua in the continuum limit. We conjecture a procedure, referred to as a lattice decay rule, for how this identification works in general. This rule allows us to compute the continuum vacuum degeneracy by studying the lattice Hamiltonian in the strong-coupling limit.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16262'&gt;arXiv:2601.16262&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 22 Jan 2026 19:00:03 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Quantum phase estimation with optimal confidence interval using three control qubits</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16474</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Kaur Kristjuhan, Dominic W. Berry&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Quantum phase estimation is an important routine in many quantum algorithms, particularly for estimating the ground state energy in quantum chemistry simulations. This estimation involves applying powers of a unitary to the ground state, controlled by an auxiliary state prepared on a control register. In many applications the goal is to provide a confidence interval for the phase estimate, and optimal performance is provided by a discrete prolate spheroidal sequence. We show how to prepare the corresponding state in a far more efficient way than prior work. We find that a matrix product state representation with a bond dimension of 4 is sufficient to give a highly accurate approximation for all dimensions tested, up to $2^{24}$. This matrix product state can be efficiently prepared using a sequence of simple three-qubit operations. When the dimension is a power of 2, the phase estimation can be performed with only three qubits for the control register, making it suitable for early-generation fault-tolerant quantum computers with a limited number of logical qubits.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16474'&gt;arXiv:2601.16474&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 23 Jan 2026 06:05:11 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>$d$-wave FFLO state and charge-2e supersolidity in the $t$-$t'$-$J$ model under Zeeman fields</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16630</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Xing-Zhou Qu, Dai-Wei Qu, Qiaoyi Li, Wei Li, Gang Su&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Unconventional superconductivity under strong Zeeman fields--particularly beyond the Pauli paramagnetic limit--remains a central challenge in condensed matter physics. The exotic Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) state, in particular, remains in need of definitive study within fundamental electronic models. Here we employ state-of-the-art finite-temperature and ground-state tensor network approaches to systematically explore the superconducting (SC) phase diagram of the $t$-$t'$-$J$ model subjected to Zeeman fields. We find that zero-momentum $d$-wave superconductivity persists until the spin gap closes, coexisting with charge density waves. A novel $d$-wave FFLO phase emerges under a higher Zeeman field even above the Pauli limit, concomitant with a field-enhanced spin density waves. We identify these phases, characterized by the simultaneous presence of pairing condensate and density wave orders, as charge-2e supersolids. Analysis of Matsubara Green's function reveals that the FFLO pairing momentum is locked to the underlying Fermi surface. Our results provide microscopic insights into field-induced unconventional pairing mechanisms and reveal the long-sought FFLO state in a fundamental correlated electron model, offering a promising route for its realization in ultracold atom optical lattice.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16630'&gt;arXiv:2601.16630&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 23 Jan 2026 10:32:35 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

It enables both low-level operations, such as vector addition, linear transformations, and Hadamard products, as well as high-level algorithms, including the approximation of linear equations, eigenvalue computations, and exponentially efficient Fourier transforms. This library can be used for traditional quantum many-body physics applications and also for quantum-inspired numerical analysis problems, such as solving PDEs, interpolating and integrating multidimensional functions, sampling multivariate probability distributions, etc.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16734'&gt;arXiv:2601.16734&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 23 Jan 2026 13:31:16 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Coarse-Grained Geometric Quantum Dynamics in the Tensor Network Representation</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16913</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Mo Sha, Bing Gu&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Quantum geometrical molecular dynamics provides a quantum geometric picture for understanding reactive dynamics, especially excited-state conical intersection dynamics, and also a numerically exact method for strongly correlated electron-nuclear dynamics. However, there are substantial challenges in describing medium-sized molecules with tens of nuclear degrees of freedom. The main challenge is that it uses a discrete variable representation to discretize the molecular configuration space, and thus requires a tremendous number of quantum chemistry calculations to construct the electronic overlap matrix. Moreover, the expansion coefficients scale exponentially with molecular size for direct-product basis sets. We address these challenges by first introducing a coarse-grained local diabatic ansatz, followed by a tensor network representation of the expansion coefficients and the molecular time-evolution operator. With a full 24-dimensional demonstration using the pyrazine molecule, we show that such developments provide a highly accurate and computationally tractable method for high-dimensional, fully quantum, strongly coupled electron-nuclear dynamics from first principles.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16913'&gt;arXiv:2601.16913&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 23 Jan 2026 17:21:31 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Formalising an operational continuum limit of quantum combs</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16974</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Clara Wassner, Jonáš Fuksa, Jens Eisert, Gregory A. L. White&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Quantum combs are powerful conceptual tools for capturing multi-time processes in quantum information theory, constituting the most general quantum mechanical process. But, despite their causal nature, they lack a meaningful physical connection to time -- and are, by and large, arguably incompatible with it without extra structure. The subclass of quantum combs which assumes an underlying process is described by the so-called process tensor framework, which has been successfully used to study and characterise non-Markovian open quantum systems. But, although process tensors are motivated by an underlying dynamics, it is not a priori clear how to connect to a continuous process tensor object mathematically -- leaving an uncomfortable conceptual gap. In this work, we take a decisive step toward remedying this situation. We introduce a fully continuous process tensor framework by showing how the discrete multi-partite Choi state becomes a field-theoretic state in bosonic Fock space, which is intrinsically and rigorously defined in the continuum. With this equipped, we lay out the core structural elements of this framework and its properties. This translation allows for an information-theoretic treatment of multi-time correlations in the continuum via the analysis of their continuous matrix product state representatives. Our work closes a gap in the quantum information literature, and opens up the opportunity for the application of many-body physics insights to our understanding of quantum stochastic processes in the continuum.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16974'&gt;arXiv:2601.16974&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 23 Jan 2026 18:49:41 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Tree tensor network solver for real-time quantum impurity dynamics</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Bo Zhan, Jia-Lin Chen, Zhen Fan, Tao Xiang&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We introduce a tree tensor network (TTN) impurity solver that enables highly efficient and accurate real-time simulations of quantum impurity models. By decomposing a noninteracting bath Hamiltonian into a Cayley tree, the method provides a tensor network representation that naturally captures the multiscale entanglement structure intrinsic to impurity-bath systems. This geometry differs from conventional chain-based mappings and yields a substantial reduction of entanglement, allowing accurate ground-state properties and long-time dynamics to be captured at significantly lower bond dimensions. Benchmark calculations for the single-impurity Anderson model demonstrate that the TTN solver achieves markedly enhanced resolution of real-frequency spectral functions, without invoking analytic continuation. This impurity solver provides a balanced, scale-uniform description of impurity physics and offers a versatile approach for real-time dynamical mean-field theory and related applications involving quantum impurity models.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17718'&gt;arXiv:2601.17718&lt;/a&gt;] Published Sun, 25 Jan 2026 06:43:48 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Quantum-Inspired Algorithms beyond Unitary Circuits: the Laplace Transform</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17724</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Noufal Jaseem, Sergi Ramos-Calderer, Gauthameshwar S., Dingzu Wang, José Ignacio Latorre, Dario Poletti&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Quantum-inspired algorithms can deliver substantial speedups over classical state-of-the-art methods by executing quantum algorithms with tensor networks on conventional hardware. Unlike circuit models restricted to unitary gates, tensor networks naturally accommodate non-unitary maps. This flexibility lets us design quantum-inspired methods that start from a quantum algorithmic structure, yet go beyond unitarity to achieve speedups. Here we introduce a tensor-network approach to compute the discrete Laplace transform, a non-unitary, aperiodic transform (in contrast to the Fourier transform). We encode a length-$N$ signal on two paired $n$-qubit registers and decompose the overall map into a non-unitary exponential Damping Transform followed by a Quantum Fourier Transform, both compressed in a single matrix-product operator. This decomposition admits strong MPO compression to low bond dimension resulting in significant acceleration. We demonstrate simulations up to $N=2^{30}$ input data points, with up to $2^{60}$ output data points, and quantify how bond dimension controls runtime and accuracy, including precise and efficient pole identification.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17724'&gt;arXiv:2601.17724&lt;/a&gt;] Published Sun, 25 Jan 2026 07:19:56 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

In particular, we employ Daubechies wavelets in momentum space, whose basis functions are labeled by resolution and translation indices, providing a natural nonperturbative truncation of both infrared and ultraviolet truncation of quantum field theories. As an application, we compute the energy spectra of a free scalar field theory and the interacting $1+1$-dimensional $φ^4$ theory. This approach successfully reproduces the well-known strong-coupling phase transition in the $m^2 &gt; 0$ regime. We find that the extracted critical coupling systematically converges toward its established value as the momentum resolution is increased, demonstrating the effectiveness of the wavelet-based Hamiltonian formulation for nonperturbative field-theoretic calculations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18449'&gt;arXiv:2601.18449&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 26 Jan 2026 12:57:10 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Global Optimization of Atomic Clusters via Physically-Constrained Tensor Train Decomposition</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18592</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Konstantin Sozykin, Nikita Rybin, Andrei Chertkov, Anh-Huy Phan, Ivan Oseledets, Alexander Shapeev, Ivan Novikov, Gleb Ryzhakov&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The global optimization of atomic clusters represents a fundamental challenge in computational chemistry and materials science due to the exponential growth of local minima with system size (i.e., the curse of dimensionality). We introduce a novel framework that overcomes this limitation by exploiting the low-rank structure of potential energy surfaces through Tensor Train (TT) decomposition. Our approach combines two complementary TT-based strategies: the algebraic TTOpt method, which utilizes maximum volume sampling, and the probabilistic PROTES method, which employs generative sampling. A key innovation is the development of physically-constrained encoding schemes that incorporate molecular constraints directly into the discretization process. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method by identifying global minima of Lennard-Jones clusters containing up to 45 atoms. Furthermore, we establish its practical applicability to real-world systems by optimizing 20-atom carbon clusters using a machine-learned Moment Tensor Potential, achieving geometries consistent with quantum-accurate simulations. This work establishes TT-decomposition as a powerful tool for molecular structure prediction and provides a general framework adaptable to a wide range of high-dimensional optimization problems in computational material science.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18592'&gt;arXiv:2601.18592&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 26 Jan 2026 15:38:20 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Multi-target density matrix renormalization group for 3D CFTs on the fuzzy sphere</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18648</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Jin-Xiang Hao, Zheng Zhu, Yang Qi&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The fuzzy sphere regularization provides a powerful framework for studying three-dimensional (3D) conformal field theories (CFTs) by mapping them onto numerically tractable lattice models on the spherical lowest Landau level. However, the system sizes accessible to this method have been limited by the exact diagonalization (ED). In this work, we transcend this limitation by combining the fuzzy sphere regularization with a sophisticated multi-target density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) algorithm. Focusing on the 3D Ising-type model on the spherical lowest Landau level, we calculate the 24 low-lying energies at a larger system size than previously feasible with ED. At criticality, we extract the scaling dimensions of six primary operators, and the results show significantly improved agreement with bootstrap benchmarks compared to previous ED results at smaller sizes. Our approach allows us to efficiently target multiple excited states in larger systems beyond the reach of exact diagonalization. This study establishes the fuzzy sphere regularization combined with advanced DMRG techniques as a powerful and general framework for precision physics in 3D CFTs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18648'&gt;arXiv:2601.18648&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 26 Jan 2026 16:18:19 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Quantum skyrmions in the antiferromagnetic triangular lattice</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18737</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Inés Corte, Federico Holik, Lorena Rebón, Flavia A. Gómez Albarracín&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Magnetic skyrmions are topological quasiparticles potentially useful for memory and computing devices. Antiferromagnetic (AF) skyrmions present no transverse deflection, making them suitable candidates for data storage applications. After the discovery of skyrmions with length scales comparable to the lattice constant, several works presented quantum analogues of classical ferromagnetic skyrmions in spin systems. However, studies about quantum analogues of AF skyrmions are still lacking. Here, we explore the phases of the AF quantum spin-1/2 Heisenberg model with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions on the triangular lattice using the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) algorithm. We study the magnetization profile, spin structure factor and quantum entanglement of the resulting ground states to characterize the corresponding phases and signal the emergence of quantum AF skyrmions. Our results support that three-sublattice quantum antiferromagnetic skyrmion textures are stabilized in a wide range of magnetic fields.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18737'&gt;arXiv:2601.18737&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 26 Jan 2026 18:00:31 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Cooper Condensation and Pair Wave Functions in Strongly Correlated Electrons</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18868</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Hannes Karlsson, Johannes S. Hofmann, Alexander Wietek&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Identifying superconducting states of matter without prior assumptions is a central challenge in strongly correlated electron systems. We introduce a canonical framework for diagnosing the formation of Cooper pair condensates based on the Penrose-Onsager criterion, in which superconducting order is encoded in the spectral properties of the two-particle reduced density matrix (2RDM). Within this formulation, the symmetry and structure of the condensate are obtained by projecting the 2RDM onto irreducible representations of the underlying symmetry group, enabling an unbiased identification of both conventional and exotic superconducting states. We demonstrate the power and versatility of the approach through applications to the two-dimensional Hubbard model, using both auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (AFQMC) and the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG). For attractive interactions without a magnetic field, we reveal a clear finite-size scaling of the condensate fraction on square lattices of size up to $20\times 20$. The framework further provides direct access to the internal structure and extent of Cooper pairs, which we track across the BCS-BEC crossover. Moreover, it enables a clean diagnosis of the finite-momentum Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) phase in a magnetic field. Finally, we apply the approach to a supersolid phase in the repulsive Hubbard model with an additional next-nearest neighbor hopping $t^\prime$, where a charge-density wave coexists with a superconductor. We confirm the fragmented nature of the condensate and uncover substantial pairing correlations in the triplet channel with $p$-wave spatial symmetry in addition to the dominant singlet $d$-wave pairing. Our results establish the 2RDM-based Penrose-Onsager framework as a broadly applicable and unbiased tool for characterizing superconducting order in correlated quantum matter.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18868'&gt;arXiv:2601.18868&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 26 Jan 2026 19:00:00 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Stacked quantum Ising systems and quantum Ashkin-Teller model</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18922</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Davide Rossini, Ettore Vicari&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We analyze the quantum states of an isolated composite system consisting of two stacked quantum Ising (SQI) subsystems, coupled by a local Hamiltonian term that preserves the $Z_2$ symmetry of each subsystem. The coupling strength is controlled by an intercoupling parameter $w$, with $w=0$ corresponding to decoupled quantum Ising systems. We focus on the quantum correlations of one of the two SQI subsystems, $S$, in the ground state of the global system, and study their dependence on both the state of the weakly-coupled complementary part $E$ and the intercoupling strength. We concentrate on regimes in which $S$ develops critical long-range correlations. The most interesting physical scenario arises when both SQI subsystems are critical. In particular, for identical SQI subsystems, the global system is equivalent to the quantum Ashkin-Teller model, characterized by an additional $Z_2$ interchange symmetry between the two subsystem operators. In this limit, one-dimensional SQI systems exhibit a peculiar critical line along which the length-scale critical exponent $ν$ varies continuously with $w$, while two-dimensional systems develop quantum multicritical behaviors characterized by an effective enlargement of the symmetry of the critical modes, from the actual $Z_2\oplus Z_2$ symmetry to a continuous O(2) symmetry.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18922'&gt;arXiv:2601.18922&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 26 Jan 2026 19:42:32 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Tensorized Discontinuous Isogeometric Analysis Method for the 2-D Time-Independent Linearized Boltzmann Transport Equation</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18925</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Patrick A. Myers, Joseph A. Bogdan, Majdi I. Radaideh, Brian C. Kiedrowski&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We present the novel Tensorized Discontinuous Isogeometric Analysis (TDIGA) method applied to the discontinuous Galerkin (DG) time-independent 2-D linearized Boltzmann transport equation (LBTE) with higher-order scattering, discretized with discrete ordinates in angle, multigroup in energy, and isogeometric analysis (IGA) in space. We formulate operator assembly in the tensor train (TT) format, producing seven-dimensional operators for both fixed-source and $k$-eigenvalue neutron transport problems solved using the restarted Generalized Minimum Residual Method (GMRES) and power iteration with an uncompressed solution vector. Our results on single-patch homogeneous and multi-patch heterogeneous problems, including a cruciform-shaped fuel array inspired by advanced reactor fuel designs, demonstrate the TT format's ability to compress interior operators from petabytes to megabytes, whereas the Compressed Sparse Row (CSR) matrix format requires gigabytes of storage. However, highly coupled boundary operators present a significant challenge for TT. Despite the storage savings, TT formatted operators increase time-to-solution relative to CSR as an uncompressed solution vector forces operator-vector product scaling of $O(dr^2N^d\log(N))$ for TT while CSR scales at $O(\text{nnz})$. We mitigate this discrepancy by using mixed formats with interior operators in TT, while high-rank boundary operators remain in CSR format. We compare all results to Monte Carlo (MC) and analytic reference solutions. While CSR remains $&lt;10\times$ faster than this mixed format, the TDIGA method enables high-fidelity transport for expensive high-order IGA meshes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18925'&gt;arXiv:2601.18925&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 26 Jan 2026 19:55:04 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Efficient Application of Tensor Network Operators to Tensor Network States</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19650</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Richard M. Milbradt, Shuo Sun, Christian B. Mendl, Johnnie Gray, Garnet K. -L. Chan&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The performance of tensor network methods has seen constant improvements over the last few years. We add to this effort by introducing a new algorithm that efficiently applies tree tensor network operators to tree tensor network states inspired by the density matrix method and the Cholesky decomposition. This application procedure is a common subroutine in tensor network methods. We explicitly include the special case of tensor train structures and demonstrate how to extend methods commonly used in this context to general tree structures. We compare our newly developed method with the existing ones in a benchmark scenario with random tensor network states and operators. We find our Cholesky-based compression (CBC) performs equivalently to the current state-of-the-art method, while outperforming most established methods by at least an order of magnitude in runtime. We then apply our knowledge to perform circuit simulation of tree-like circuits, in order to test our method in a more realistic scenario. Here, we find that more complex tree structures can outperform simple linear structures and achieve lower errors than those possible with the simple structures. Additionally, our CBC still performs among the most successful methods, showing less dependence on the different bond dimensions of the operator.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19650'&gt;arXiv:2601.19650&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 27 Jan 2026 14:26:37 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Containments of Tensor Network Varieties</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19805</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Sofía Garzón Mora, Christian Haase&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Building upon the work of Buczyńska et al., we study here tensor formats and their corresponding encoding of tensors via two-fold tensor products determined by the combinatorics of a binary tree. The set of all tensors representable by a given network forms the corresponding tensor network variety. A very basic question asks whether every tensor representable by one network is representable by another network, namely, when one tensor network variety is contained in another. Specific instances of this question became known as the Hackbusch Conjecture. Here, we propose a general framework for this question and take first steps, theoretical as well as experimental, towards a better understanding. In particular, given any two binary trees on $n$ leaves, we define (and prove existence of) a new measure, the containment exponent, which gauges how much one has to boost the parameters of one network for the containment to hold. We present an algorithm for bounding these containment exponents of tensor network varieties and report on an exhaustive search among trees on up to $n=8$ leaves.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19805'&gt;arXiv:2601.19805&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 27 Jan 2026 17:06:57 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Semantic Uncertainty Quantification of Hallucinations in LLMs: A Quantum Tensor Network Based Method</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20026</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Pragatheeswaran Vipulanandan, Kamal Premaratne, Dilip Sarkar&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Large language models (LLMs) exhibit strong generative capabilities but remain vulnerable to confabulations, fluent yet unreliable outputs that vary arbitrarily even under identical prompts. Leveraging a quantum tensor network based pipeline, we propose a quantum physics inspired uncertainty quantification framework that accounts for aleatoric uncertainty in token sequence probability for semantic equivalence based clustering of LLM generations. This offers a principled and interpretable scheme for hallucination detection. We further introduce an entropy maximization strategy that prioritizes high certainty, semantically coherent outputs and highlights entropy regions where LLM decisions are likely to be unreliable, offering practical guidelines for when human oversight is warranted. We evaluate the robustness of our scheme under different generation lengths and quantization levels, dimensions overlooked in prior studies, demonstrating that our approach remains reliable even in resource constrained deployments. A total of 116 experiments on TriviaQA, NQ, SVAMP, and SQuAD across multiple architectures including Mistral-7B, Mistral-7B-instruct, Falcon-rw-1b, LLaMA-3.2-1b, LLaMA-2-13b-chat, LLaMA-2-7b-chat, LLaMA-2-13b, and LLaMA-2-7b show consistent improvements in AUROC and AURAC over state of the art baselines.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20026'&gt;arXiv:2601.20026&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 27 Jan 2026 20:01:33 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Ground-State Phase Diagram of (1/2,1/2,1) Mixed Diamond Chains with Single-Site Anisotropy</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20328</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Kazuo Hida&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The ground-state phases of mixed diamond chains with ($S, τ^{(1)}, τ^{(2)})=(1/2,1/2,1)$, where $S$ is the magnitude of vertex spins, and $τ^{(1)}$ and $τ^{(2)}$ are those of apical spins, are investigated with the single-site anisotropy $D$ on the $τ^{(2)}$-site. The two apical spins in each unit cell are coupled by an exchange coupling $λ$. The vertex spins are coupled with the top and bottom apical spins by exchange couplings $1+δ$ and $1-δ$, respectively. The ground-state phase diagram is determined using the numerical exact diagonalization and DMRG method in addition to the analytical approximations in various limiting cases. The phase diagram consists of a Néel ordered phase, a nonmagnetic Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid phase, quantized and partial ferrimagnetic phases. A region with anisotropy inversion is found where the Ising-like Néel phase is realized for the easy-plane anisotropy $D &gt;0$ and the XY-like Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid phase is realized for the easy-axis anisotropy $D &lt;0$ on the $S=1$ sites.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20328'&gt;arXiv:2601.20328&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 28 Jan 2026 07:47:04 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Variational Monte Carlo (VMC) with row-update Projected Entangled-Pair States (PEPS) and its applications in quantum spin glasses</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20608</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Tao Chen, Jing Liu, Yantao Wu, Pan Zhang, Youjin Deng&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Solving the quantum many-body ground state problem remains a central challenge in computational physics. In this context, the Variational Monte Carlo (VMC) framework based on Projected Entangled Pair States (PEPS) has witnessed rapid development, establishing itself as a vital approach for investigating strongly correlated two-dimensional systems. However, standard PEPS-VMC algorithms predominantly rely on sequential local updates. This conventional approach often suffers from slow convergence and critical slowing down, particularly in the vicinity of phase transitions or within frustrated landscapes. To address these limitations, we propose an efficient autoregressive row-wise sampling algorithm for PEPS that enables direct, rejection-free sampling via single-layer contractions. By utilizing autoregressive single-layer row updates to generate collective, non-local configuration proposals, our method significantly reduces temporal correlations compared to local Metropolis moves. We benchmark the algorithm on the two-dimensional transverse-field Ising model and the quantum spin glass. Our results demonstrate that the row-wise scheme effectively mitigates critical slowing down near the Ising critical point. Furthermore, in the rugged landscape of the quantum spin glass, it yields improved optimization stability and lower ground-state energies. These findings indicate that single-layer autoregressive row updates provide a flexible and robust improvement to local PEPS-VMC sampling and may serve as a basis for more advanced sampling schemes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20608'&gt;arXiv:2601.20608&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 28 Jan 2026 13:44:43 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Tensor renormalization group study of cold and dense QCD in the strong coupling limit</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20690</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Yuto Sugimoto, Shinichiro Akiyama, Yoshinobu Kuramashi&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We study the phase structure of the (3+1)-dimensional cold and dense QCD with the Kogut--Susskind quark in the strong coupling limit using the tensor renormalization group method. The chiral and nuclear transitions are investigated by calculating the chiral condensate and the quark number density as a function of the chemical potential. For a fixed temporal extent $N_τ=8$, we determine the critical quark masses $m_c^χ$ and $m_c^{n}$ for the chiral condensate and the quark number density, respectively, at which the first-order phase transition terminates with the vanishing discontinuity in thermodynamic quantities. We find that both quantities at the same quark mass exhibit a discontinuity at the same chemical potential, and the resulting critical quark masses are consistent with each other. We also compare our results for the critical quark masses with those obtained from the Monte Carlo simulation in the dual formulation and from the mean-field analysis. We further confirm the first-order phase transition at finite quark mass on a $1024^4$ lattice, which is essentially in the thermodynamic limit at zero temperature, as expected from the mean-field analysis.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20690'&gt;arXiv:2601.20690&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 28 Jan 2026 15:20:32 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Symplectic Optimization on Gaussian States</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Christopher Willby, Tomohiro Hashizume, Jason Crain, Dieter Jaksch&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Computing Gaussian ground states via variational optimization is challenging because the covariance matrices must satisfy the uncertainty principle, rendering constrained or Riemannian optimization costly, delicate, and thus difficult to scale, particularly in large and inhomogeneous systems. We introduce a symplectic optimization framework that addresses this challenge by parameterizing covariance matrices directly as positive-definite symplectic matrices using unit-triangular factorizations. This approach enforces all physical constraints exactly, yielding a globally unconstrained variational formulation of the bosonic ground-state problem. The unconstrained structure also naturally supports solution reuse across nearby Hamiltonians: warm-starting from previously optimized covariance matrices substantially reduces the number of optimization steps required for convergence in families of related configurations, as encountered in crystal lattices, molecular systems, and fluids. We demonstrate the method on weakly dipole-coupled lattices, recovering ground-state energies, covariance matrices, and spectral gaps accurately. The framework further provides a foundation for large-scale approximate treatments of weakly non-quadratic interactions and offers potential scaling advantages through tensor-network enhancements.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20832'&gt;arXiv:2601.20832&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 28 Jan 2026 18:31:50 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

Huse, Rhine Samajdar&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We investigate the emergence of an amplitude (Higgs-like) mode in the gapless phase of the $(1+1)$D XXZ spin chain. Unlike conventional settings where amplitude modes arise from spontaneous symmetry breaking, here, we identify a symmetry-preserving underdamped excitation on top of a Luttinger-liquid ground state. Using nonequilibrium quench spectroscopy, we demonstrate that this mode manifests as oscillations of U(1)-symmetric observables following a sudden quench. By combining numerical simulations with Bethe-ansatz analyses, we trace its microscopic origin to specific families of string excitations. We further discuss experimental pathways to detect this mode in easy-plane quantum magnets and programmable quantum simulators. Our results showcase the utility of quantum quenches as a powerful tool to probe collective excitations, beyond the scope of linear response.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20926'&gt;arXiv:2601.20926&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 28 Jan 2026 19:00:00 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Spin-orbit-induced Instability and Finite-Temperature Stabilization of a Triangular-lattice Supersolid</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20963</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Seongjun Park, Sung-Min Park, Yun-Tak Oh, Hyun-Yong Lee, Eun-Gook Moon&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Geometrically frustrated triangular-lattice magnets provide fertile ground for realizing intriguing quantum phases such as spin supersolids. A common expectation is that spin-orbit coupling (SOC), which breaks continuous spin rotational symmetry, destabilizes these phases by gapping their low-energy modes. Revisiting this assumption, we map out the SOC-field phase diagram of a frustrated triangular-lattice magnet using spin-wave theory and infinite density-matrix renormalization group (iDMRG) simulations. We find that while infinitesimally weak SOC indeed drives a zero-temperature instability of the supersolid by opening a gap, certain supersolid states remain thermodynamically stable at non-zero temperatures. This reveals a previously unrecognized mechanism in which thermal fluctuations counteract SOC to stabilize supersolidity. The resulting finite-temperature supersolids retain key responses, including a giant magnetocaloric effect, highlighting their potential relevance to real materials. At larger SOC, the system transitions into distinct magnetic orders, including a skyrmion lattice, completing a unified phase diagram.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20963'&gt;arXiv:2601.20963&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 28 Jan 2026 19:03:52 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Quantum LEGO Learning: A Modular Design Principle for Hybrid Artificial Intelligence</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21780</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Jun Qi, Chao-Han Huck Yang, Pin-Yu Chen, Min-Hsiu Hsieh, Hector Zenil, Jesper Tegner&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Hybrid quantum-classical learning models increasingly integrate neural networks with variational quantum circuits (VQCs) to exploit complementary inductive biases. However, many existing approaches rely on tightly coupled architectures or task-specific encoders, limiting conceptual clarity, generality, and transferability across learning settings. In this work, we introduce Quantum LEGO Learning, a modular and architecture-agnostic learning framework that treats classical and quantum components as reusable, composable learning blocks with well-defined roles. Within this framework, a pre-trained classical neural network serves as a frozen feature block, while a VQC acts as a trainable adaptive module that operates on structured representations rather than raw inputs. This separation enables efficient learning under constrained quantum resources and provides a principled abstraction for analyzing hybrid models. We develop a block-wise generalization theory that decomposes learning error into approximation and estimation components, explicitly characterizing how the complexity and training status of each block influence overall performance. Our analysis generalizes prior tensor-network-specific results and identifies conditions under which quantum modules provide representational advantages over comparably sized classical heads. Empirically, we validate the framework through systematic block-swap experiments across frozen feature extractors and both quantum and classical adaptive heads. Experiments on quantum dot classification demonstrate stable optimization, reduced sensitivity to qubit count, and robustness to realistic noise.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21780'&gt;arXiv:2601.21780&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 29 Jan 2026 14:29:21 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Quotient geometry of tensor ring decomposition</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21874</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Bin Gao, Renfeng Peng, Ya-xiang Yuan&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Differential geometries derived from tensor decompositions have been extensively studied and provided the foundations for a variety of efficient numerical methods. Despite the practical success of the tensor ring (TR) decomposition, its intrinsic geometry remains less understood, primarily due to the underlying ring structure and the resulting nontrivial gauge invariance. We establish the quotient geometry of TR decomposition by imposing full-rank conditions on all unfolding matrices of the core tensors and capturing the gauge invariance. Additionally, the results can be extended to the uniform TR decomposition, where all core tensors are identical. Numerical experiments validate the developed geometries via tensor ring completion tasks.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21874'&gt;arXiv:2601.21874&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 29 Jan 2026 15:40:44 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>A scalable quantum-enhanced greedy algorithm for maximum independent set problems</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21923</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Elisabeth Wybo, Jami Rönkkö, Olli Hirviniemi, Jernej Rudi Finžgar, Martin Leib&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We investigate a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm for solving the Maximum Independent Set (MIS) problem on regular graphs, combining the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) with a minimal degree classical greedy algorithm. The method leverages pre-computed QAOA angles, derived from depth-$p$ QAOA circuits on regular trees, to compute local expectation values and inform sequential greedy decisions that progressively build an independent set. This hybrid approach maintains shallow quantum circuit and avoids instance-specific parameter training, making it well-suited for implementation on current quantum hardware: we have implemented the algorithm on a 20 qubit IQM superconducting device to find independent sets in graphs with thousands of nodes. We perform tensor network simulations to evaluate the performance of the algorithm beyond the reach of current quantum hardware and compare to established classical heuristics. Our results show that even at low depth ($p=4$), the quantum-enhanced greedy method significantly outperforms purely classical greedy baselines as well as more sophisticated approximation algorithms. The modular structure of the algorithm and relatively low quantum resource requirements make it a compelling candidate for scalable, hybrid optimization in the NISQ era and beyond.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21923'&gt;arXiv:2601.21923&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 29 Jan 2026 16:14:48 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

In these notes I pedagogically introduce the setting of brickwork quantum circuits and show that it provides a useful framework to study non-equilibrium quantum many-body dynamics in the presence of local interactions. I first show that brickwork quantum circuits evolve quantum correlations in a way that is fundamentally similar to local Hamiltonians, and then present examples of brickwork quantum circuits where, surprisingly, one can compute exactly several relevant dynamical and spectral properties in the presence of non-trivial interactions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22375'&gt;arXiv:2601.22375&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 29 Jan 2026 22:40:13 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Spiral Phase and Phase Diagram of the $S$=1/2 XXZ Model on the Shastry-Sutherland Lattice</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22924</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Zhengpeng Yuan, Muwei Wu, Dao-Xin Yao, Han-Qing Wu&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We investigate the ground-state phase diagram of the $S$=1/2 XXZ model on the two-dimensional Shastry-Sutherland lattice using exact diagonalization (ED), density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG), and cluster mean-field theory (CMFT) with DMRG as a solver. In the isotropic case ($Δ=1$), CMFT results reveal an intermediate empty plaquette (EP) phase that has a lower energy than the full plaquette (FP) phase. However, due to mean-field artifacts, CMFT alone is not suitable for accurately determining phase boundaries. Therefore, we combined three methods to map out the reliable phase diagram. Our calculations show that the EP phase narrows as $Δ$ deviates from unity and eventually vanishes. More importantly, we identify a spiral phase at small $Δ$, which has not been reported in previous studies. This phase is clearly captured by DMRG simulations on long cylindrical geometries. The competition between the EP, spiral, and $xy$-AFM phases near their boundaries provides a plausible explanation for the emergent spin-liquid-like behavior in RE$_2$Be$_2$GeO$_2$, while shedding new light on the role of XXZ anisotropy in the Shastry-Sutherland XXZ model.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22924'&gt;arXiv:2601.22924&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 30 Jan 2026 12:43:47 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Mrinmoy Basak&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We employ the wavelet formalism of quantum field theory to study field theories in the nonperturbative Hamiltonian framework. Specifically, we make use of Daubechies wavelets in momentum space. These basis elements are characterised by a resolution and a translation index that provides for a natural nonperturbative infrared and ultraviolet truncation of the quantum field theory. As an application, we consider the $φ^4$ theory and demonstrate the emergence of the well-known nonperturbative strong-coupling phase transition in the $m^2&gt;0$ sector.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22953'&gt;arXiv:2601.22953&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 30 Jan 2026 13:16:00 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Entanglement Hamiltonians in dissipative free fermions and the time-dependent GGE</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Riccardo Travaglino, Federico Rottoli, Pasquale Calabrese&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We investigate the dynamics of Entanglement Hamiltonians (EHs) in dissipative free-fermionic systems using a recent operator-based formulation of the quasiparticle picture. Focusing on gain and loss dissipation, we study the post-quench evolution and derive explicit expressions for the EH at the ballistic scale. In the long-time and weak-dissipation regime, the EH is shown to take the form of a time-dependent Generalized Gibbs Ensemble (t-GGE), with a structure that is universal across different initial states of the quench protocol. Within this framework, the emergence of the t-GGE is fully accounted for by the quasiparticle picture, and we argue that this description remains valid whenever the Lindbladian admits an appropriate coarse-grained representation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23234'&gt;arXiv:2601.23234&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 30 Jan 2026 18:05:58 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Entanglement-Dependent Error Bounds for Hamiltonian Simulation</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00555</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Prateek P. Kulkarni&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We establish tight connections between entanglement entropy and the approximation error in Trotter-Suzuki product formulas for Hamiltonian simulation. Product formulas remain the workhorse of quantum simulation on near-term devices, yet standard error analyses yield worst-case bounds that can vastly overestimate the resources required for structured problems. For systems governed by geometrically local Hamiltonians with maximum entanglement entropy $S_\text{max}$ across all bipartitions, we prove that the first-order Trotter error scales as $\mathcal{O}(t^2 S_\text{max} \operatorname{polylog}(n)/r)$ rather than the worst-case $\mathcal{O}(t^2 n/r)$, where $n$ is the system size and $r$ is the number of Trotter steps. This yields improvements of $\tildeΩ(n^2)$ for one-dimensional area-law systems and $\tildeΩ(n^{3/2})$ for two-dimensional systems. We extend these bounds to higher-order Suzuki formulas, where the improvement factor involves $2^{pS^*/2}$ for the $p$-th order formula. We further establish a separation result demonstrating that volume-law entangled systems fundamentally require $\tildeΩ(n)$ more Trotter steps than area-law systems to achieve the same precision. This separation is tight up to logarithmic factors. Our analysis combines Lieb-Robinson bounds for locality, tensor network representations for entanglement structure, and novel commutator-entropy inequalities that bound the expectation value of nested commutators by the Schmidt rank of the state. These results have immediate applications to quantum chemistry, condensed matter simulation, and resource estimation for fault-tolerant quantum computing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00555'&gt;arXiv:2602.00555&lt;/a&gt;] Published Sat, 31 Jan 2026 06:34:37 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Scalable Tensor Network Simulation for Quantum-Classical Dual Kernel</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Mei Ian Sam, Tai-Yu Li&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; This paper presents an efficient and scalable tensor network framework for quantum kernel circuit simulation, alleviating practical costs associated with increasing qubit counts and data size. The framework enables systematic large-scale evaluation of a linearly mixed quantum-classical dual kernel of up to 784 qubits. Using Fashion-MNIST, the classification performance of the test dataset is compared between a classical kernel, a quantum kernel, and the quantum-classical dual kernel across the feature dimensions from 2 to 784, with a one-to-one mapping between encoded features and qubits. Our result shows that the quantum-classical dual kernel consistently outperforms both single-kernel baselines, remains stable as the dimensionality increases, and mitigates the large-scale degradation observed in the quantum kernel. Analysis of the learned mixing weights indicates that quantum contributions dominate below 128 features, while classical contributions become increasingly important beyond 128, suggesting that the classical kernel provides a stabilizing anchor against concentration effects and hardware noise while preserving quantum gains at lower dimensions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01330'&gt;arXiv:2602.01330&lt;/a&gt;] Published Sun, 01 Feb 2026 16:50:36 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>A Practical Tensor-Network Compression Pipeline for Production-Scale Large Language Models</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01613</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Sergii Kozyrev, Davyd Maiboroda&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Large language models are limited in deployment by GPU memory and inference latency. We present Minima, a production compression pipeline that learns where and how to structurally compress a Transformer and turns that compression into real serving gains. Minima trains a lightweight convolutional predictor to estimate layer- and patch-level sensitivity, applies a mixture of Tucker, tensor-train, and tensor-ring decompositions to low-sensitivity regions, performs a short healing fine-tune, and executes the resulting operators with custom Triton and CUDA kernels. The reduced memory footprint enables speculative decoding with a small draft model and a larger verifier. On Qwen3-32B at an 8k-token context window, Minima reduces peak VRAM from 64 GiB to 40 GiB. For a single active request, throughput increases from 40 tokens per second (baseline) to 50 tokens per second (Minima) and 75 tokens per second (Minima with speculative decoding). Under 50 parallel requests, throughput is 34, 44, and 53 tokens per second respectively, showing that Minima remains effective under high concurrency even when speculative decoding gains compress. We position Minima relative to recent tensor-network, low-rank plus quantization, and cross-layer sharing methods, and argue that it is a practical step toward more aggressive structural compression via shared tensor backbones with tiny per-layer adapters.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01613'&gt;arXiv:2602.01613&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 02 Feb 2026 04:03:39 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Putting machine learning to the test in a quantum many-body system</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01981</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Yilun Gao, Alberto Rodríguez, Rudolf A. Römer&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Quantum many-body systems pose a formidable computational challenge due to the exponential growth of their Hilbert space. While machine learning (ML) has shown promise as an alternative paradigm, most applications remain at the proof-of-concept stage, focusing narrowly on energy estimation at the lower end of the spectrum. Here, we push ML beyond this frontier by extensively testing HubbardNet, a deep neural network architecture for the Bose-Hubbard model. Pushing improvements in the optimizer and learning rates, and introducing physics-informed output activations that can resolve extremely small wave-function amplitudes, we achieve ground-state energy errors reduced by orders of magnitude and wave-function fidelities exceeding 99%. We further assess physical relevance by analysing generalized inverse participation ratios and multifractal dimensions for ground and excited states in one and two dimensions, demonstrating that optimized ML models reproduce localization, delocalization, and multifractality trends across the spectrum. Crucially, these qualitative predictions remain robust across four decades of the interaction strength, e.g. spanning across superfluid, Mott-insulating, as well as quantum chaotic regimes. Together, these results suggest ML as a viable qualitative predictor of many-body structure, complementing the quantitative strengths of exact diagonalization and tensor-network methods.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01981'&gt;arXiv:2602.01981&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 02 Feb 2026 11:36:39 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Optimizing Tensor Train Decomposition in DNNs for RISC-V Architectures Using Design Space Exploration and Compiler Optimizations</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01996</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Theologos Anthimopoulos, Milad Kokhazadeh, Vasilios Kelefouras, Benjamin Himpel, Georgios Keramidas&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Deep neural networks (DNNs) have become indispensable in many real-life applications like natural language processing, and autonomous systems. However, deploying DNNs on resource-constrained devices, e.g., in RISC-V platforms, remains challenging due to the high computational and memory demands of fully connected (FC) layers, which dominate resource consumption. Low-rank factorization (LRF) offers an effective approach to compressing FC layers, but the vast design space of LRF solutions involves complex trade-offs among FLOPs, memory size, inference time, and accuracy, making the LRF process complex and time-consuming. This paper introduces an end-to-end LRF design space exploration methodology and a specialized design tool for optimizing FC layers on RISC-V processors. Using Tensor Train Decomposition (TTD) offered by TensorFlow T3F library, the proposed work prunes the LRF design space by excluding first, inefficient decomposition shapes and second, solutions with poor inference performance on RISC-V architectures. Compiler optimizations are then applied to enhance custom T3F layer performance, minimizing inference time and boosting computational efficiency. On average, our TT-decomposed layers run 3x faster than IREE and 8x faster than Pluto on the same compressed model. This work provides an efficient solution for deploying DNNs on edge and embedded devices powered by RISC-V architectures.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01996'&gt;arXiv:2602.01996&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 02 Feb 2026 11:56:36 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

Tensor networks are an invaluable tool for efficiently representing states of large quantum systems with limited entanglement. Algorithms for sampling one-dimensional (1D) tensor networks are well-established and utilized in several 1D tensor network methods. In this paper we introduce two novel sampling algorithms for two-dimensional (2D) isometric tensor network states (isoTNS) that can be viewed as extensions of algorithms for 1D tensor networks. The first algorithm we propose performs independent sampling and yields a single configuration together with its associated probability. The second algorithm employs a greedy search strategy to identify K high-probability configurations and their corresponding probabilities. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of these algorithms across quantum states with varying entanglement and system size.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02245'&gt;arXiv:2602.02245&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 02 Feb 2026 15:54:25 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Approaching the Thermodynamic Limit with Neural-Network Quantum States</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02665</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Luciano Loris Viteritti, Riccardo Rende, Subir Sachdev, Giuseppe Carleo&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Accessing the thermodynamic-limit properties of strongly correlated quantum matter requires simulations on very large lattices, a regime that remains challenging for numerical methods, especially in frustrated two-dimensional systems. We introduce the Spatial Attention mechanism, a minimal and physically interpretable inductive bias for Neural-Network Quantum States, implemented as a single learned length scale within the Transformer architecture. This bias stabilizes large-scale optimization and enables access to thermodynamic-limit physics through highly accurate simulations on unprecedented system sizes within the Variational Monte Carlo framework. Applied to the spin-$\tfrac12$ triangular-lattice Heisenberg antiferromagnet, our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on clusters of up to $42\times42$ sites. The ability to simulate such large systems allows controlled finite-size scaling of energies and order parameters, enabling the extraction of experimentally relevant quantities such as spin-wave velocities and uniform susceptibilities. In turn, we find extrapolated thermodynamic limit energies systematically better than those obtained with tensor-network approaches such as iPEPS. The resulting magnetization is strongly renormalized, $M_0=0.148(1)$ (about $30\%$ of the classical value), revealing that less accurate variational states systematically overestimate magnetic order. Analysis of the optimized wave function further suggests an intrinsically non-local sign structure, indicating that the sign problem cannot be removed by local basis transformations. We finally demonstrate the generality of the method by obtaining state-of-the-art energies for a $J_1$-$J_2$ Heisenberg model on a $20\times20$ square lattice, outperforming Residual Convolutional Neural Networks.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02665'&gt;arXiv:2602.02665&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 02 Feb 2026 19:00:05 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Compiling Quantum Regular Language States</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02698</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Armando Bellante, Reinis Irmejs, Marta Florido-Llinàs, María Cea Fernández, Marianna Crupi, Matthew Kiser, J. Ignacio Cirac&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; State preparation compilers for quantum computers typically sit at two extremes: general-purpose routines that treat the target as an opaque amplitude vector, and bespoke constructions for a handful of well-known state families. We ask whether a compiler can instead accept simple, structure-aware specifications while providing predictable resource guarantees. We answer this by designing and implementing a quantum state-preparation compiler for regular language states (RLS): uniform superpositions over bitstrings accepted by a regular description, and their complements. Users describe the target state via (i) a finite set of bitstrings, (ii) a regular expression, or (iii) a deterministic finite automaton (DFA), optionally with a complement flag. By translating the input to a DFA, minimizing it, and mapping it to an optimal matrix product state (MPS), the compiler obtains an intermediate representation (IR) that exposes and compresses hidden structure. The efficient DFA representation and minimization offloads expensive linear algebra computation in exchange of simpler automata manipulations. The combination of the regular-language frontend and this IR gives concise specifications not only for RLS but also for their complements that might otherwise require exponentially large state descriptions. This enables state preparation of an RLS or its complement with the same asymptotic resources and compile time. We outline two hardware-aware backends: SeqRLSP, which yields linear-depth, ancilla-free circuits for linear nearest-neighbor architectures via sequential generation, and TreeRLSP, which achieves logarithmic depth on all-to-all connectivity via a tree tensor network. We prove depth and gate-count bounds scaling with the system size and the state's maximal Schmidt rank, and we give explicit compile-time bounds that expose the benefit of our approach.

      <title>Calculating Feynman diagrams with matrix product states</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03598</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Xavier Waintal&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; This text reviews, hopefully in a pedagogical manner, a series of work on the automatic calculations of Feynman diagrams in the context of quantum nanoelectronics (Keldysh formalism) with an application to the Kondo effect in the out-of-equilibrium single impurity Anderson model. It includes a discussion of (A) how to deal with the proliferation of diagrams, (B) how to calculate them using the Tensor Cross Interpolation algorithm instead of Monte-Carlo and (C) how to resum the obtained series. These notes correspond to a lecture given at the Autumn School on Correlated Electrons 2025 in Jullich, Germany. The book with all the lectures of the school (edited by Eva Pavarini, Erik Koch, Alexander Lichtenstein, and Dieter Vollhardt) is available in open access.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03598'&gt;arXiv:2602.03598&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 03 Feb 2026 14:52:17 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Spin and Charge Conductivity in the Square Lattice Fermi-Hubbard Model</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03771</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Linh Pham, Ehsan Khatami&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Dynamical properties are notoriously difficult to compute in numerical treatments of the Fermi-Hubbard model, especially in two spatial dimensions. However, they are essential in providing us with insight into some of the most important and less well-understood phases of the model, such as the pseudogap and strange metal phases at relatively high temperatures, or unconventional superconductivity at lower temperatures, away from the commensurate filling. Here, we use the numerical linked-cluster expansions to compute spin and charge optical conductivities of the model at different temperatures and strong interaction strengths via the exact real-time-dependent correlation functions of the current operators. We mitigate systematic errors associated with having a limited access to the long-time behavior of the correlators by introducing fits and allowing for non-zero Drude weights when appropriate. We compare our results to available data from optical lattice experiments and find that the Drude contributions can account for the theory-experiment gap in the DC spin conductivity of the model at half filling in the strong-coupling region. Our method helps paint a more complete picture of the conductivity in the two-dimensional Hubbard model and opens the door to studying dynamical properties of quantum lattice models in the thermodynamic limit.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03771'&gt;arXiv:2602.03771&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 03 Feb 2026 17:29:07 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Primary charge-4e superconductivity from doping a featureless Mott insulator</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03925</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Zhi-Qiang Gao, Yan-Qi Wang, Ya-Hui Zhang, Hui Yang&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Superconductivity is usually understood as a phase in which charge-$2e$ Cooper pairs are condensed. Charge-$4e$ superconductivity has largely been discussed as a vestigial order at finite temperature emerging from charge-$2e$ states. Primary charge-$4e$ superconducting phases at zero temperature remain scarce in both experiments and microscopic models. Here we argue that a doped featureless Mott insulator with $SU(4)$ symmetry provides a natural platform for primary charge-$4e$ superconductivity, based on perturbative renormalization group arguments and group theoretic considerations. As a concrete realization, we construct a bilayer Hubbard model with tunable onsite $SU(4)$ and $Sp(4)$ symmetries that exhibits a featureless Mott insulating phase at half filling. Its low energy physics is captured by a generalized ESD model, featuring an effective Hamiltonian that is purely kinetic within the constrained Hilbert space. Using density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations, we find a primary charge-$4e$ superconducting phase in the $SU(4)$ ESD model and a conventional primary charge-$2e$ phase in the $Sp(4)$ case. We further characterize the corresponding normal states and discuss the resulting finite temperature phase diagram.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03925'&gt;arXiv:2602.03925&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 03 Feb 2026 19:00:00 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

Cox&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The study of quantum circuit simulation using classical computers is a key research topic that helps define the boundary of verifiable quantum advantage, solve quantum many-body problems, and inform development of quantum hardware and software. Tensor networks have become forefront mathematical tools for these tasks. Here we introduce a method to approximately simulate quantum circuits using sparsely-populated tensors. We describe a sparse tensor data structure that can represent quantum states with no underlying symmetry, and outline algorithms to efficiently contract and truncate these tensors. We show that the data structure and contraction algorithm are efficient, leading to expected runtime scalings versus qubit number and circuit depth. Our results motivate future research in optimization of sparse tensor networks for quantum simulation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04011'&gt;arXiv:2602.04011&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 03 Feb 2026 20:58:32 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Quantum and Classical Algorithms for the 1D Burgers Equation: QTN, HSE, and PINN</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04239</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Vanshaj Kerni, Abdelrahman E. Ahmed, Syed Ali Asghar&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We present a comparative benchmark of Quantum Tensor Networks (QTN), the Hydrodynamic Schrödinger Equation (HSE), and Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINN) for simulating the 1D Burgers' equation. Evaluating these emerging paradigms against classical GMRES and Spectral baselines, we analyse solution accuracy, runtime scaling, and resource overhead across grid resolutions ranging from $N=4$ to $N=128$. Our results reveal a distinct performance hierarchy. The QTN solver achieves superior precision ($L_2 \sim 10^{-7}$) with remarkable near-constant runtime scaling, effectively leveraging entanglement compression to capture shock fronts. In contrast, while the Finite-Difference HSE implementation remains robust, the Spectral HSE method suffers catastrophic numerical instability at high resolutions, diverging significantly at $N=128$. PINNs demonstrate flexibility as mesh-free solvers but stall at lower accuracy tiers ($L_2 \sim 10^{-1}$), limited by spectral bias compared to grid-based methods. Ultimately, while quantum methods offer novel representational advantages for low-resolution fluid dynamics, this study confirms they currently yield no computational advantage over classical solvers without fault tolerance or significant algorithmic breakthroughs in handling non-linear feedback.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04239'&gt;arXiv:2602.04239&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:57:27 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Pre-optimization of quantum circuits, barren plateaus and classical simulability: tensor networks to unlock the variational quantum eigensolver</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Baptiste Anselme Martin, Thomas Ayral&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Variational quantum algorithms are practical approaches to prepare ground states, but their potential for quantum advantage remains unclear. Here, we use differentiable 2D tensor networks (TN) to optimize parameterized quantum circuits that prepare the ground state of the transverse field Ising model (TFIM). Our method enables the preparation of states with high energy accuracy, even for large systems beyond 1D. We show that TN pre-optimization can mitigate the barren plateau issue by giving access to enhanced gradient zones that do not shrink exponentially with system size. We evaluate the classical simulation cost evaluating energies at these warm-starts, and identify regimes where quantum hardware offers better scaling than TN simulations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04676'&gt;arXiv:2602.04676&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 04 Feb 2026 15:49:55 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Incommensurate pair-density-wave correlations in two-leg ladder $t$--$J$--$J_\perp$ model</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04945</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Hanbit Oh, Julian May-Mann, Ya-Hui Zhang&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We report the discovery of a generalized Luther-Emery liquid phase characterized by incommensurate pair-density-wave (iC-PDW) correlations in the two-leg $t$-$J$-$J_\perp$ ladder model. By tuning the potential difference between the legs, we explore the regime of intermediate layer polarization $P$. Combining density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations with bosonization analysis, we identify a spin-gapped phase at finite $P$, where the interlayer and intralayer pair correlations both oscillate, but with distinct periodicities. The interlayer correlations exhibit FFLO-like oscillations, driven by pairing between layers with mismatched Fermi momenta, with a period determined by their momentum difference. In contrast, the intralayer pair correlations arise from the coupling between charges on one layer and spin fluctuations on the opposite layer, with a momentum equal to twice the Fermi momentum of the opposite layer. The iC-PDW state is robust across a wide range of doping and polarization, although finite interlayer hopping eventually destabilizes it toward a state with charge-$4e$ correlations. We conclude by discussing the experimental realization of this model in optical lattice platforms and its relevance to the bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04945'&gt;arXiv:2602.04945&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 04 Feb 2026 19:00:00 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Towards $2+1$D quantum electrodynamics on a cold-atom quantum simulator</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04948</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Peter Majcen, Jesse J. Osborne, Philipp Hauke, Bing Yang, Simone Montangero, Jad C. Halimeh&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Cold atoms have become a powerful platform for quantum-simulating lattice gauge theories in higher spatial dimensions. However, such realizations have been restricted to the lowest possible truncations of the gauge field, which limit the connections one can make to lattice quantum electrodynamics. Here, we propose a feasible cold-atom quantum simulator of a $(2+1)$-dimensional U$(1)$ lattice gauge theory in a spin $S=1$ truncation, featuring dynamical matter and gauge fields. We derive a mapping of this theory onto a bosonic computational basis, stabilized by an emergent gauge-protection mechanism through quantum Zeno dynamics. The implementation is based on a single-species Bose--Hubbard model realized in a tilted optical superlattice. This approach requires only moderate experimental resources already available in current ultracold-atom platforms. Using infinite matrix product state simulations, we benchmark real-time dynamics under global quenches. The results demonstrate faithful evolution of the target gauge theory and robust preservation of the gauge constraints. Our work significantly advances the experimental prospects for simulating higher-dimensional lattice gauge theories using larger gauge-field truncations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04948'&gt;arXiv:2602.04948&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 04 Feb 2026 19:00:00 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Efficient time-evolution of matrix product states using average Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04955</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Belal Abouraya, Jirawat Saiphet, Fedor Jelezko, Ressa S. Said&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Simulating quantum many-body systems (QMBS) is one of the long-standing, highly non-trivial challenges in condensed matter physics and quantum information due to the exponentially growing size of the system's Hilbert space. To date, tensor networks have been an essential tool for studying such quantum systems, owing to their ability to efficiently capture the entanglement properties of the systems they represent. One of the well-known tensor network architectures, namely matrix product states (MPS), is the standard method for simulating one-dimensional QMBS. Here, we propose a simple, yet efficient, method to augment the already available MPS algorithms to simulate the dynamics of time-dependent Hamiltonians with better accuracy and a faster convergence rate, giving a second-order convergence compared to the first-order convergence of the standard method. We apply our proposed method to simulate the dynamics of a chain of single spins associated with nitrogen-vacancy color centers in diamonds, which has potential applications for practical and scalable quantum technologies, and find that our method improves the average error for a system of few NV centers by a factor of about 1000 for moderate step sizes. Our work paves the way for efficient simulation of QMBS under the influence of time-dependent Hamiltonians.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04955'&gt;arXiv:2602.04955&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 04 Feb 2026 19:00:01 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Quantum-Inspired Algorithm for Classical Spin Hamiltonians Based on Matrix Product Operators</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05224</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Ryo Watanabe, Joseph Tindall, Shohei Miyakoshi, Hiroshi Ueda&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We propose a tensor-network (TN) approach for solving classical optimization problems that is inspired by spectral filtering and sampling on quantum states. We first shift and scale an Ising Hamiltonian of the cost function so that all eigenvalues become non-negative and the ground states correspond to the the largest eigenvalues, which are then amplified by power iteration. We represent the transformed Hamiltonian as a matrix product operator (MPO) and form an immense power of this object via truncated MPO-MPO contractions, embedding the resulting operator into a matrix product state for sampling in the computational basis. In contrast to the density-matrix renormalization group, our approach provides a straightforward route to systematic improvement by increasing the bond dimension and is better at avoiding local minima. We also study the performance of this power method in the context of a higher-order Ising Hamiltonian on a heavy-hexagonal lattice, making a comparison with simulated annealing. These results highlight the potential of quantum-inspired algorithms for solving optimization problems and provide a baseline for assessing and developing quantum algorithms.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05224'&gt;arXiv:2602.05224&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 05 Feb 2026 02:29:37 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Branch-and-Bound Tensor Networks for Exact Ground-State Characterization</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05470</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Yijia Wang, Xuanzhao Gao, Pan Zhang, Feng Pan, Jinguo Liu&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Characterizing the ground-state properties of disordered systems, such as spin glasses and combinatorial optimization problems, is fundamental to science and engineering. However, computing exact ground states and counting their degeneracies are generally NP-hard and #P-hard problems, respectively, posing a formidable challenge for exact algorithms. Recently, Tensor Networks methods, which utilize high-dimensional linear algebra and achieve massive hardware parallelization, have emerged as a rapidly developing paradigm for efficiently solving these tasks. Despite their success, these methods are fundamentally constrained by the exponential growth of space complexity, which severely limits their scalability. To address this bottleneck, we introduce the Branch-and-Bound Tensor Network (BBTN) method, which seamlessly integrates the adaptive search framework of branch-and-bound with the efficient contraction of tropical tensor networks, significantly extending the reach of exact algorithms. We show that BBTN significantly surpasses existing state-of-the-art solvers, setting new benchmarks for exact computation. It pushes the boundaries of tractability to previously unreachable scales, enabling exact ground-state counting for $\pm J$ spin glasses up to $64 \times 64$ and solving Maximum Independent Set problems on King's subgraphs up to $100 \times 100$. For hard instances, BBTN dramatically reduces the computational cost of standard Tropical Tensor Networks, compressing years of runtime into minutes. Furthermore, it outperforms leading integer-programming solvers by over 30$\times$, establishing a versatile and scalable framework for solving hard problems in statistical physics and combinatorial optimization.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05470'&gt;arXiv:2602.05470&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 05 Feb 2026 09:17:23 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

This workshop follows the first Workshop (CECAM workshop on Tensor Contraction Library Standardization), which took place in Toulouse one year earlier, on May 24-25, 2024 and led to the formation of a tensor standardization working group, which has since specified a low-level standard interface for tensor operations available freely on GitHub. The 2025 workshop brought together developers of applications which rely extensively on tensor computations such as quantum many-body simulations in chemistry and physics (material science and electronic structure calculations), as well as developers and experts of tensor software who have the know-how to provide the technical support for such applications. The workshop enabled the community to provide feedback on the specified low-level interface and how it can be further refined. It also initiated a discussion on how the standardization efforts should be oriented in the near feature, in particular on what should be higher-level interfaces and how to tackle other requirements of the community such as tensor decompositions, symmetric tensors and structured sparsity support.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05490'&gt;arXiv:2602.05490&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 05 Feb 2026 09:51:39 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Reducing the Computational Cost Scaling of Tensor Network Algorithms via Field-Programmable Gate Array Parallelism</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05900</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Songtai Lv, Yang Liang, Rui Zhu, Qibin Zheng, Haiyuan Zou&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Improving the computational efficiency of quantum many-body calculations from a hardware perspective remains a critical challenge. Although field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) have recently been exploited to improve the computational scaling of algorithms such as Monte Carlo methods, their application to tensor network algorithms is still at an early stage. In this work, we propose a fine-grained parallel tensor network design based on FPGAs to substantially enhance the computational efficiency of two representative tensor network algorithms: the infinite time-evolving block decimation (iTEBD) and the higher-order tensor renormalization group (HOTRG). By employing a quad-tile partitioning strategy to decompose tensor elements and map them onto hardware circuits, our approach effectively translates algorithmic computational complexity into scalable hardware resource utilization, enabling an extremely high degree of parallelism on FPGAs. Compared with conventional CPU-based implementations, our scheme exhibits superior scalability in computation time, reducing the bond-dimension scaling of the computational cost from $O(D_b^3)$ to $O(D_b)$ for iTEBD and from $O(D_b^6)$ to $O(D_b^2)$ for HOTRG. This work provides a theoretical foundation for future hardware implementations of large-scale tensor network computations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05900'&gt;arXiv:2602.05900&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 05 Feb 2026 17:16:44 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Spontaneous Parity Breaking in Quantum Antiferromagnets on the Triangular Lattice</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05901</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Songtai Lv, Yuchen Meng, Haiyuan Zou&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Frustration on the triangular lattice has long been a source of intriguing and often debated phases in many-body systems. Although symmetry analysis has been employed, the role of the seemingly trivial parity symmetry has received little attention. In this work, we show that phases induced by frustration are systematically shaped by an implicit rule of thumb associated with spontaneous parity breaking. This principle enables us to anticipate and rationalize the regimes and conditions under which nontrivial phases emerge. For the spin-$S$ antiferromagnetic XXZ model, we demonstrate that a controversial parity-broken phase appears only at intermediate values of $S$. In bilayer systems, enhanced frustration leads to additional phases, such as supersolids, whose properties can be classified by their characteristic parity features. Benefiting from our improved tensor network contraction techniques, we confirm these results through large-scale tensor-network calculations. This study offers an alternative viewpoint and a systematic approach for examining the interplay between spin, symmetry, and frustration in many-body systems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05901'&gt;arXiv:2602.05901&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 05 Feb 2026 17:16:52 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

Martin, Giuseppe Cocco, Javier Fonollosa&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The realization of fault-tolerant quantum computers remains a challenging endeavor, forcing state-of-the-art quantum hardware to rely heavily on noise mitigation techniques. Standard quantum error mitigation is typically based on post-processing strategies. In contrast, the present work explores a pre-processing approach, in which the effects of noise are mitigated before performing a measurement on the output state. The main idea is to find an observable $Y$ such that its expectation value on a noisy quantum state $\mathcal{E(ρ)}$ matches the expectation value of a target observable $X$ on the noiseless quantum state $ρ$. Our method requires the execution of a noisy quantum circuit, followed by the measurement of the surrogate observable $Y$. The main enablers of our method in practical scenarios are Tensor Networks. The proposed method improves over Tensor Error Mitigation (TEM) in terms of average error, circuit depth, and complexity, attaining a measurement overhead that approaches the theoretical lower bound. The improvement in terms of classical computation complexity is in the order of $\sim 10^6$ times when compared to the post-processing computational cost of TEM in practical scenarios. Such gain comes from eliminating the need to perform the set of informationally complete positive operator-valued measurements (IC-POVM) required by TEM, as well as any other tomographic strategy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05916'&gt;arXiv:2602.05916&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 05 Feb 2026 17:30:05 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Private and interpretable clinical prediction with quantum-inspired tensor train models</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06110</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; José Ramón Pareja Monturiol, Juliette Sinnott, Roger G. Melko, Mohammad Kohandel&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Machine learning in clinical settings must balance predictive accuracy, interpretability, and privacy. Models such as logistic regression (LR) offer transparency, while neural networks (NNs) provide greater predictive power; yet both remain vulnerable to privacy attacks. We empirically assess these risks by designing attacks that identify which public datasets were used to train a model under varying levels of adversarial access, applying them to LORIS, a publicly available LR model for immunotherapy response prediction, as well as to additional shallow NN models trained for the same task. Our results show that both models leak significant training-set information, with LRs proving particularly vulnerable in white-box scenarios. Moreover, we observe that common practices such as cross-validation in LRs exacerbate these risks. To mitigate these vulnerabilities, we propose a quantum-inspired defense based on tensorizing discretized models into tensor trains (TTs), which fully obfuscates parameters while preserving accuracy, reducing white-box attacks to random guessing and degrading black-box attacks comparably to Differential Privacy. TT models retain LR interpretability and extend it through efficient computation of marginal and conditional distributions, while also enabling this higher level of interpretability for NNs. Our results demonstrate that tensorization is widely applicable and establishes a practical foundation for private, interpretable, and effective clinical prediction.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06110'&gt;arXiv:2602.06110&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 05 Feb 2026 19:00:00 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Magnon-Mediated Superconductivity in the Infinite-$U$ Triangular Lattice</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Hantian Zhu, Yixin Zhang, Shang-Shun Zhang, Yang Zhang, Cristian D. Batista&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We demonstrate that the infinite-$U$ triangular-lattice Hubbard model supports a superconducting state built from tightly bound Cooper pairs composed of two holes and one magnon ($2h1m$). Building on the seminal prediction of repulsively bound $2h1m$ states, we show that next-nearest-neighbor hopping $t_{2}$ coherently mixes symmetry-related configurations, stabilizing an $s$-wave bound state with substantial binding energy and a light effective mass. Large-scale DMRG calculations at finite doping identify a magnetization plateau corresponding to a gas of such bound states and quasi--long--range superconducting order with power-law $2h1m$ pair correlations. Our results establish a magnon-mediated superconducting mechanism driven by kinetic frustration, with immediate detectable signatures for moiré Hubbard materials and ultracold-atom simulators.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06231'&gt;arXiv:2602.06231&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 05 Feb 2026 22:19:12 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Fermionic Approach to Elementary Excitations and Magnetization Plateaus in an S=1/2 XX Hybrid Trimer-Dimer Chain</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06387</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; K. S. Chikara, A. K. Bera, A. Kumar, S. M. Yusuf&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We study the elementary excitations and magnetization of a one-dimensional spin-1/2 XX chain comprising trimer-dimer units (the J1-J1-J2-J3-J2 topology) under a transverse magnetic field h. Using Green's function theory and the Jordan-Wigner transformation, we map the system onto spinless fermions and focus on antiferromagnetic (AFM) interactions. At zero temperature, distinct 1/5 and 3/5 magnetization plateaus emerge, determined by the global periodicity Q=5, with the number of plateaus matching the number of excitation gaps above the Fermi level of the spinless fermions. The magnetic phase diagram in the (h-Js) plane features a Luttinger liquid (LL) state, a gapless AFM state, two magnetization plateau states, and a fully polarized gapped magnetic state. The widths of the LL and gapless AFM phases are found to be proportional to the bandwidths gamma = |E(k=0)-E(k=pi)| of the corresponding elementary excitations, whereas the widths of the magnetization plateau states are governed by the excitation gaps. Our study opens new directions for exploring interacting trimer-dimer spin chains in quantum magnetism using experimental techniques such as neutron scattering, as well as theoretical and numerical approaches including quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) and density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) methods. Furthermore, we extend the Oshikawa-Yamanaka-Affleck (OYA) condition to generalized cluster chains, demonstrating that the allowed magnetization plateaus are governed by the global periodicity of the chain (e.g., Q=5 for a trimer-dimer chain), rather than by the local periodicity of individual units (Q=3 for a trimer or Q=2 for a dimer).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06387'&gt;arXiv:2602.06387&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 06 Feb 2026 04:52:51 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Tensor network dynamical message passing for epidemic models</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06497</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Cheng Ye, Zi-Song Shen, Pan Zhang&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; While epidemiological modeling is pivotal for informing public health strategies, a fundamental trade-off limits its predictive fidelity: exact stochastic simulations are often computationally intractable for large-scale systems, whereas efficient analytical approximations typically fail to account for essential short-range correlations and network loops. Here, we resolve this trade-off by introducing Tensor Network Dynamical Message Passing (TNDMP), a framework grounded in a rigorous property we term \textit{Susceptible-Induced Factorization}. This theoretical insight reveals that a susceptible node acts as a dynamical decoupler, factorizing the global evolution operator into localized components. Leveraging this, TNDMP provides a dual-mode algorithmic suite: an exact algorithm that computes local observables with minimal redundancy on tractable topologies and a scalable and tunable approximation for complex real-world networks. We demonstrate that widely adopted heuristics, such as Dynamical Message Passing (DMP) and Pair Approximation (PA), are mathematically recoverable as low-order limits of our framework. Numerical validation in synthetic and real-world networks confirms that TNDMP significantly outperforms existing methods to predict epidemic thresholds and steady states, offering a rigorous bridge between the efficiency of message passing and the accuracy of tensor network formalisms.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06497'&gt;arXiv:2602.06497&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 06 Feb 2026 08:47:29 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Measurement-Based Preparation of Higher-Dimensional AKLT States and Their Quantum Computational Power</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07201</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Wenhan Guo, Mikhail Litvinov, Tzu-Chieh Wei, Abid Khan, Kevin C. Smith&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We investigate a constant-time, fusion measurement-based scheme to create AKLT states beyond one dimension. We show that it is possible to prepare such states on a given graph up to random spin-1 `decorations', each corresponding to a probabilistic insertion of a vertex along an edge. In investigating their utility in measurement-based quantum computation, we demonstrate that any such randomly decorated AKLT state possesses at least the same computational power as non-random ones, such as those on trivalent planar lattices. For AKLT states on Bethe lattices and their decorated versions we show that there exists a deterministic, constant-time scheme for their preparation. In addition to randomly decorated AKLT states, we also consider random-bond AKLT states, whose construction involves any of the canonical Bell states in the bond degrees of freedom instead of just the singlet in the original construction. Such states naturally emerge upon measuring all the decorative spin-1 sites in the randomly decorated AKLT states. We show that those random-bond AKLT states on trivalent lattices can be converted to encoded random graph states after acting with the same POVM on all sites. We also argue that these random-bond AKLT states possess similar quantum computational power as the original singlet-bond AKLT states via the percolation perspective.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07201'&gt;arXiv:2602.07201&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 06 Feb 2026 21:22:35 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>An Efficient and Robust Projection Enhanced Interpolation Based Tensor Train Decomposition</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07653</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Daniel Hayes, Jing-Mei Qiu, Tianyi Shi&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The tensor-train (TT) format is a data-sparse tensor representation commonly used in high dimensional data approximations. In order to represent data with interpretability in data science, researchers develop data-centric skeletonized low rank approximations. However, these methods might still suffer from accuracy degeneracy, nonrobustness, and high computation costs. In this paper, given existing skeletonized TT approximations, we propose a family of projection enhanced interpolation based algorithms to further improve approximation accuracy while keeping low computational complexity. We do this as a postprocessing step to existing interpolative decompositions, via oversampling data not in skeletons to include more information and selecting subsets of pivots for faster projections. We illustrate the performances of our proposed methods with extensive numerical experiments. These include up to 10D synthetic datasets such as tensors generated from kernel functions, and tensors constructed from Maxwellian distribution functions that arise in kinetic theory. Our results demonstrate significant accuracy improvement over original skeletonized TT approximations, while using limited amount of computational resources.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07653'&gt;arXiv:2602.07653&lt;/a&gt;] Published Sat, 07 Feb 2026 18:30:29 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>A quantum-inspired multi-level tensor-train monolithic space-time method for nonlinear PDEs</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07945</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; N. R. Rapaka, R. Peddinti, E. Tiunov, N. J. Faraj, A. N. Alkhooori, L. Aolita, Y. Addad, M. K. Riahi&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We propose a multilevel tensor-train (TT) framework for solving nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs) in a global space-time formulation. While space-time TT solvers have demonstrated significant potential for compressed high-dimensional simulations, the literature contains few systematic comparisons with classical time-stepping methods, limited error convergence analyses, and little quantitative assessment of the impact of TT rounding on numerical accuracy. Likewise, existing studies fail to demonstrate performance across a diverse set of PDEs and parameter ranges. In practice, monolithic Newton iterations may stagnate or fail to converge in strongly nonlinear, stiff, or advection-dominated regimes, where poor initial guesses and severely ill-conditioned space-time Jacobians hinder robust convergence. We overcome this limitation by introducing a coarse-to-fine multilevel strategy fully embedded within the TT format. Each level refines both spatial and temporal resolutions while transferring the TT solution through low-rank prolongation operators, providing robust initializations for successive Newton solves. Residuals, Jacobians, and transfer operators are represented directly in TT and solved with the adaptive-rank DMRG algorithm. Numerical experiments for a selection of nonlinear PDEs including Fisher-KPP, viscous Burgers, sine-Gordon, and KdV cover diffusive, convective, and dispersive dynamics, demonstrating that the multilevel TT approach consistently converges where single-level space-time Newton iterations fail. In dynamic, advection-dominated (nonlinear) scenarios, multilevel TT surpasses single-level TT, achieving high accuracy with significantly reduced computational cost, specifically when high-fidelity numerical simulation is required.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07945'&gt;arXiv:2602.07945&lt;/a&gt;] Published Sun, 08 Feb 2026 12:38:16 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Forward-mode automatic differentiation for the tensor renormalization group and its relation to the impurity method</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Yuto Sugimoto&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We propose a forward-mode automatic differentiation (AD) framework for tensor renormalization group (TRG) methods. In this approach, evaluating the derivatives of the partition function up to order $k$ increases the matrix-multiplication cost by a factor of $(k+1)(k+2)/2$ compared to computing the free energy alone, while the memory footprint is only $k$ times that of the original calculation. In the limit where the derivatives of the SVD are neglected, we establish a theoretical correspondence between our forward-mode AD and conventional impurity methods. Numerically, we find that the proposed AD algorithm can calculate internal energy and specific heat significantly higher accuracy than the impurity method at comparable computational cost. We also provide a practical procedure to extract critical exponents from derivatives of the renormalized tensor in TRG calculations in both two and three dimensions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08987'&gt;arXiv:2602.08987&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 09 Feb 2026 18:34:21 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Average Categorical Symmetries in One-Dimensional Disordered Systems</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09083</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Yabo Li, Meng Cheng, Ruochen Ma&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We study one-dimensional disordered systems with average non-invertible symmetries, where quenched disorder may locally break part of the symmetry while preserving it upon disorder averaging. A canonical example is the random transverse-field Ising model, which at criticality exhibits an average Kramers-Wannier duality. We consider the general setting in which the full symmetry is described by a $G$-graded fusion category $\mathcal{B}$, whose identity component $\mathcal{A}$ remains exact, while the components with nontrivial $G$-grading are realized either exactly or only on average. We develop a topological holographic framework that encodes the symmetry data of the 1D system in a 2D topological order $\mathcal{Z}[\mathcal{A}]$ (the Drinfeld center of $\mathcal{A}$), enriched by an exact or, respectively, average $G$ symmetry. Within this framework, we obtain a complete classification of anomalies and average symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases: when the components with nontrivial $G$-grading are realized only on average, the symmetry is anomaly-free if and only if $\mathcal{Z}[\mathcal{A}]$ admits a magnetic Lagrangian algebra that is invariant under the permutation action of $G$ on anyons. When an anomaly is present, we show that the ground state of a single disorder realization is long-range entangled with probability one in the thermodynamic limit, and is expected to exhibit power-law Griffiths singularities in the low-energy spectrum. Finally, we present an explicit, exactly solvable lattice model based on a symmetry-enriched string-net construction. It yields trivial ground state ensemble in the anomaly-free case, and exhibits exotic low-energy behavior in the presence of an average anomaly.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09083'&gt;arXiv:2602.09083&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 09 Feb 2026 18:59:14 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Anomalous spin transport in integrable random quantum circuits</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09098</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Songlei Wang, Chenguang Liang, Hongzheng Zhao, Zhi-Cheng Yang&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; High-temperature spin transport in integrable quantum spin chains exhibits a rich dynamical phase diagram, including ballistic, superdiffusive, and diffusive regimes. While integrability is known to survive in static and periodically driven systems, its fate in the complete absence of time-translation symmetry, particularly in interacting random quantum circuits, has remained unclear. Here we construct integrable random quantum circuits built from inhomogeneous XXZ R-matrices. Remarkably, integrability is preserved for arbitrary sequences of gate layers, ranging from quasiperiodic to fully random, thereby explicitly breaking both continuous and discrete time-translation symmetry. Using large-scale time-dependent density-matrix renormalization group simulations at infinite temperature and half filling, we map out the resulting spin-transport phase diagram and identify ballistic, superdiffusive, and diffusive regimes controlled by the spectral parameters of the R-matrices. The spatiotemporal structure of spin correlations within each regime depends sensitively on the inhomogeneity, exhibiting spatial asymmetry and sharp peak structures tied to near-degenerate quasiparticle velocities. To account for these findings, we develop a generalized hydrodynamics framework adapted to time-dependent integrable circuits, yielding Euler-scale predictions for correlation functions, Drude weights, and diffusion bounds. This approach identifies the quasiparticles governing transport and quantitatively captures both the scaling exponents and fine structures of the correlation profiles observed numerically. Our results demonstrate that exact Yang-Baxter integrability is compatible with stochastic quantum dynamics and establish generalized hydrodynamics as a predictive framework for transport in time-dependent integrable systems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09098'&gt;arXiv:2602.09098&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 09 Feb 2026 19:00:02 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Tunable many-body burst in isolated quantum systems</title>

We propose a numerical method to construct a low-entangled initial state that creates a ``burst''$\unicode{x2013}\unicode{x2013}$a transient deviation of an observable from its thermal equilibrium value$\unicode{x2013}\unicode{x2013}$at a designated time. We apply this method to demonstrate that a burst of magnetization can be realized for a nonintegrable mixed-field Ising chain on a timescale comparable to the onset of quantum scrambling. Contrary to the typical spreading of information in this regime, the created burst is accompanied by a slow or even negative entanglement growth. Analytically, we show that a burst becomes probabilistically rare after a long time. Our results suggest that a nonequilibrium state is maintained for an appropriately chosen initial state until scrambling becomes dominant. These predictions can be tested with programmable quantum simulators.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09665'&gt;arXiv:2602.09665&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 10 Feb 2026 11:20:44 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

By strengthening proofs relating to small-angle initialisation, we provide a full circuit model which does not suffer from barren plateaus and is robust against current classical simulation techniques, specifically tensor network contraction and Pauli propagation. We propose this as a quantum generative model amenable towards NISQ devices and quantum-classical hybrid models, raising new questions in the debate regarding usefulness of VQCs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10049'&gt;arXiv:2602.10049&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 10 Feb 2026 18:17:28 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Simulating superconductivity in mixed-dimensional $t_\parallel$-${J}_\parallel$-${J}_\perp$ bilayers with neural quantum states</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10091</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Hannah Lange, Ao Chen, Antoine Georges, Fabian Grusdt, Annabelle Bohrdt, Christopher Roth&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Motivated by the recent discovery of superconductivity in the bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ (LNO) under pressure, we study a mixed-dimensional (mixD) bilayer $t_\parallel$-$J_\parallel$-$J_\perp$ model, which has been proposed as an effective low-energy description of LNO. Using neural quantum states (NQS), and in particular Gutzwiller-projected Hidden Fermion Pfaffian State, we access the ground-state properties on large lattices up to $8\times 8\times 2$ sites. We show that this model exhibits superconductivity across a wide range of dopings and couplings, and analyze the pairing behavior in detail. We identify a crossover from tightly bound, Bose-Einstein-condensed interlayer pairs at strong interlayer exchange to more spatially extended Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer-like pairs as the interlayer exchange is decreased. Furthermore, upon tuning the intralayer exchange, we observe a sharp transition from interlayer $s$-wave pairing to intralayer $d$-wave pairing, consistent with a first-order change in the pairing symmetry. We verify that our simulations are accurate by comparing with matrix product state simulations on coupled ladders. Our results represent the first simulation of a fermionic multi-orbital system with NQS, and provide the first evidence for superconductivity in two-dimensonal bilayers using high-precision numerics. These findings provide insight into superconductivity in bilayer nickelates and cold atom quantum simulation platforms.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10091'&gt;arXiv:2602.10091&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 10 Feb 2026 18:55:55 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Generalized Kramers-Wannier Self-Duality in Hopf-Ising Models</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10183</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Da-Chuan Lu, Arkya Chatterjee, Nathanan Tantivasadakarn&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The Kramers-Wannier transformation of the 1+1d transverse-field Ising model exchanges the paramagnetic and ferromagnetic phases and, at criticality, manifests as a non-invertible symmetry. Extending such self-duality symmetries beyond gauging of abelian groups in tensor-product Hilbert spaces has, however, remained challenging. In this work, we construct a generalized 1+1d Ising model based on a finite-dimensional semisimple Hopf algebra $H$ that enjoys an anomaly-free non-invertible symmetry $\mathrm{Rep}(H)$. We provide an intuitive diagrammatic formulation of both the Hamiltonian and the symmetry operators using a non-(co)commutative generalization of ZX-calculus built from Hopf-algebraic data. When $H$ is self-dual, we further construct a generalized Kramers-Wannier duality operator that exchanges the paramagnetic and ferromagnetic phases and becomes a non-invertible symmetry at the self-dual point. This enlarged symmetry mixes with lattice translation and, in the infrared, flows to a weakly integral fusion category given by a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ extension of $\mathrm{Rep}(H)$. Specializing to the Kac-Paljutkin algebra $H_8$, the smallest self-dual Hopf algebra beyond abelian group algebras, we numerically study the phase diagram and identify four of the six $\mathrm{Rep}(H_8)$-symmetric gapped phases, separated by Ising critical lines and meeting at a multicritical point. We also realize all six $\mathrm{Rep}(H_8)$-symmetric gapped phases on the lattice via the $H$-comodule algebra formalism, in agreement with the module-category classification of $\mathrm{Rep}(H_8)$. Our results provide a unified Hopf-algebraic framework for non-invertible symmetries, dualities, and the tensor product lattice models that realize them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10183'&gt;arXiv:2602.10183&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 10 Feb 2026 19:00:00 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Entanglement percolation in random quantum networks</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Alessandro Romancino, Jordi Romero-Pallejà, G. Massimo Palma, Anna Sanpera&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Entanglement percolation aims at generating maximal entanglement between any two nodes of a quantum network by utilizing strategies based solely on local operations and classical communication between the nodes. As it happens in classical percolation theory, the topology of the network is crucial, but also the entanglement shared between the nodes of the network. In a network of identically partially entangled states, the network topology determines the minimum entanglement needed for percolation. In this work, we generalize the protocol to scenarios where the initial entanglement shared between each two nodes of the network is not the same but has some randomness. In such cases, we find that for classical entanglement percolation, only the average initial entanglement is relevant. In contrast, the quantum entanglement percolation protocol generally performs worse under these more realistic conditions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10189'&gt;arXiv:2602.10189&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 10 Feb 2026 19:00:01 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>A web of exact mappings from RK models to spin chains</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10205</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Gurkirat Singh, Inti Sodemann&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We study Rokhsar-Kivelson (RK) dimer and spin ice models realizing $U(1)$-lattice gauge theories in a wide class of quasi-one-dimensional settings, which define a setup for the study of few quantum strings (closed electric field lines) interacting with themselves and each other. We discover a large collection of mappings of these models onto three quantum chains: the spin-1/2 XXZ chain, a spin-1 chain, and a kinetically constrained fermion chain whose configurations are best described in terms of tilings of a rectangular strip. We show that the twist of boundary conditions in the chains maps onto the transverse momentum of the electric field string, and their Drude weight to the inverse of the string mass per unit length. We numerically determine the phase diagrams for these spin chains, employing DMRG simulations and find global similarities but also many interesting new features in comparison to the full 2D problems. For example, the spin-1 chain we obtain features a continuous family of degenerate ground states at its RK point analogous to a Bloch sphere, but without an underlying microscopic global $SU(2)$ symmetry. We also argue for the existence of a (stable) Landau-forbidden gapless critical point away from the RK point in one of the models we study using bosonization and numerics. This is surprising given that the full 2D problem is generically gapped away from the RK point. The same model also displays extensively many local conserved quantities which fragment the Hilbert space, arising as a consequence of destructive resonances between the electric field lines. Our findings highlight spin-chain mappings as a potent technique for the exploration of unusual dynamics, exotic criticality, and low-energy physics in lattice gauge theories.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10205'&gt;arXiv:2602.10205&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 10 Feb 2026 19:00:56 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Mapping reservoir-enhanced superconductivity to near-long-range magnetic order in the undoped 1D Anderson- and Kondo-lattices</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11153</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; J. E. Ebot, Lorenzo Pizzino, Sam Mardazad, Johannes S. Hofmann, Thierry Giamarchi, Adrian Kantian&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The undoped Kondo necklace in 1D is a paradigmatic and well understood model of a Kondo insulator. This work performs the first large-scale study of the 1D Anderson-lattice underlying the Kondo necklace with quasi-exact numerical methods, comparing this with the perturbative effective 1D Kondo-necklace model derived from the former. This study is based on an exact mapping of the Anderson model to one of a superconducting pairing layer connected to a metallic reservoir which is valid in arbitrary spatial dimensions, thereby linking the previously disparate areas of reservoir-enhanced superconductivity, following Kivelson's pioneering proposals, and that of periodic Kondo-systems. Our work reveals that below the length-scales on which the insulating state sets in, which can be very large, superconducting and density-density correlations are degenerate and may both appear to approach an almost ordered state, to a degree that far exceeds that of any isolated 1D pairing layer with short-range interactions. We trace these effects to the effective extended-range coupling that the metallic layer mediates within the pairing layer. These results translate directly to the appearance of near-long-range magnetic order at intermediate scales in the Kondo-systems, and explain the strong renormalization of the RKKY-coupling that we effectively observe, in terms of the back-action of the pairing layer onto the metallic layer. The effects we predict could be tested either by local probes of quasi-1D heavy fermion compounds such as CeCo$_2$Ga$_8$, in engineered chains of ad-atoms or in ultracold atomic gases.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11153'&gt;arXiv:2602.11153&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 11 Feb 2026 18:59:10 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of Shastry-Sutherland Model under Magnetic Field</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11589</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Menghan Song, Chengkang Zhou, Cheng Huang, Zi Yang Meng&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Motivated by the recent experimental discovery of the $T$-linear specific heat in pressurized and magnetized Shastry-Sutherland Mott insulator SrCu$_2$(BO$_3$)$_2$, we perform the state-of-the-art thermal tensor-network computation on the Shastry-Sutherland model under a magnetic field. Our simulation results suggest the existence of a symmetric intermediate phase with $T$-linear specific heat at low temperature, occupying a large parameter space and separating the plaquette-singlet phase and antiferromagnetic phase at low fields and other symmetry-breaking phases at high fields before the system is fully polarized. Such an unexpected novel state bears an astonishing similarity to the experimental findings in the material. It opens the door to further investigations of the possible liberation of deconfined magnetized Dirac spinons by the competing interactions in this highly frustrated quantum magnet model, and by the combined effects of magnetic field and pressure in the the associated Shastry-Sutherland Mott insulator SrCu$_2$(BO$_3$)$_2$.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11589'&gt;arXiv:2602.11589&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 12 Feb 2026 05:15:21 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Study of multi-particle states with tensor renormalization group method</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12025</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Fathiyya Izzatun Az-zahra, Shinji Takeda, Takeshi Yamazaki&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We investigate the multi-particle states of the (1+1)-dimensional Ising model using a spectroscopy scheme based on the tensor renormalization group method. We start by computing the finite-volume energy spectrum of the model from the transfer matrix, which is numerically estimated using the coarse-grained tensor network. We then identify the quantum number and momentum of the eigenstates by using the symmetries of the system and the matrix elements of an appropriate interpolating operator. Next, we plot the energy for a particular quantum number and momentum as a function of system size to identify the number of particles in the corresponding energy eigenstates. With this method, we obtain one-, two-, and three-particle states. We also compute the two-particle scattering phase shift using Lüscher's formula as well as the wave function approach, and compare the results with the exact prediction.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12025'&gt;arXiv:2602.12025&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 12 Feb 2026 14:57:22 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Scalable Preparation of Matrix Product States with Sequential and Brick Wall Quantum Circuits</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12042</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Tomasz Szołdra, Rick Mukherjee, Peter Schmelcher&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Preparing arbitrary quantum states requires exponential resources. Matrix Product States (MPS) admit more efficient constructions, particularly when accuracy is traded for circuit complexity. Existing approaches to MPS preparation mostly rely on heuristic circuits that are deterministic but quickly saturate in accuracy, or on variational optimization methods that reach high fidelities but scale poorly. This work introduces an end-to-end MPS preparation framework that combines the strengths of both strategies within a single pipeline. Heuristic staircase-like and brick wall disentangler circuits provide warm-start initializations for variational optimization, enabling high-fidelity state preparation for large systems. Target MPSs are either specified as physical quantum states or constructed from classical datasets via amplitude encoding, using step-by-step singular value decompositions or tensor cross interpolation. The framework incorporates entanglement-based qubit reordering, reformulated as a quadratic assignment problem, and low-level optimizations that reduce depths by up to 50% and CNOT counts by 33%. We evaluate the full pipeline on datasets of varying complexity across systems of 19-50 qubits and identify trade-offs between fidelity, gate count, and circuit depth. Optimized brick wall circuits typically achieve the lowest depths, while the optimized staircase-like circuits minimize gate counts. Overall, our results provide principled and scalable protocols for preparing MPSs as quantum circuits, supporting utility-scale applications on near-term quantum devices.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12042'&gt;arXiv:2602.12042&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 12 Feb 2026 15:07:11 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Remarks on non-invertible symmetries on a tensor product Hilbert space in 1+1 dimensions</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12053</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Kansei Inamura&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We propose an index of non-invertible symmetry operators in 1+1 dimensions and discuss its relation to the realizability of non-invertible symmetries on the tensor product of finite dimensional on-site Hilbert spaces on the lattice. Our index generalizes the Gross-Nesme-Vogts-Werner index of invertible symmetry operators represented by quantum cellular automata (QCAs). Assuming that all fusion channels of symmetry operators have the same index, we show that the fusion rules of finitely many symmetry operators on a tensor product Hilbert space can agree, up to QCAs, only with those of weakly integral fusion categories. We also discuss an attempt to establish an index theory for non-invertible symmetries within the framework of tensor networks. To this end, we first propose a general class of matrix product operators (MPOs) that describe non-invertible symmetries on a tensor product Hilbert space. These MPOs, which we refer to as topological injective MPOs, include all invertible symmetries, non-anomalous fusion category symmetries, and the Kramers-Wannier symmetries for finite abelian groups. For topological injective MPOs, we construct the defect Hilbert spaces and the corresponding sequential quantum circuit representations. We also show that all fusion channels of topological injective MPOs have the same index if there exist fusion and splitting tensors that satisfy appropriate conditions. The existence of such fusion and splitting tensors has not been proven in general, although we construct them explicitly for all examples of topological injective MPOs listed above.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12053'&gt;arXiv:2602.12053&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 12 Feb 2026 15:17:58 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>A Stochastic Cluster Expansion for Electronic Correlation in Large Systems</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12254</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Annabelle Canestraight, Anthony J. Dominic, Andres Montoya-Castillo, Libor Veis, Vojtech Vlcek&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Accurate many-body treatments of condensed-phase systems are challenging because correlated solvers such as full configuration interaction (FCI) and the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) scale exponentially with system size. Downfolding and embedding approaches mitigate this cost but typically require prior selection of a correlated subspace, which can be difficult to determine in heterogeneous or extended systems. Here, we introduce a stochastic cluster expansion framework for efficiently recovering the total correlation energy of large systems with near-DMRG accuracy, without the need to select an active space a priori. By combining correlation contributions from randomly sampled environment orbitals with an exactly treated subspace of interest, the method reproduces total energies for non-reacting and reactive systems while drastically reducing computational cost. The approach also provides a quantitative diagnostic for molecule-solvent correlation, guiding principled embedding decisions. This framework enables systematically improvable many-body calculations in extended systems, opening the door to high-accuracy studies of chemical processes in condensed phase environments.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12254'&gt;arXiv:2602.12254&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 12 Feb 2026 18:42:03 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>
