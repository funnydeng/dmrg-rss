      <title>Magnetic order and strongly-correlated effects in the one-dimensional Ising-Kondo lattice</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00432</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Xiaofan Zhou, Jingtao Fan, Suotang Jia&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We investigate the magnetic order and related strongly-correlated effects in an one-dimensional Ising-Kondo lattice with transverse field. This model is the anisotropic limit of the conventional isotropic Kondo lattice model, in the sense that the itinerant electrons interact with the localized magnetic moments via only longitudinal Kondo exchange. Adopting the numerical density-matrix-renormalization group method, we map out the ground-state phase diagram in various parameter spaces. Depending on the Kondo coupling and filling number, three distinct phases, including a metallic paramagnetic, a metallic ferromagnetic, and a gapped spin-density wave phase, are obtained. The spin-density wave is characterized by an ordering wave vector which coincides with the nesting wave vector of the Fermi surface. This makes the corresponding magnetic transition a spin analog of the Peierls transition occurring in the one-dimensional metal. Moreover, by analyzing the momentum distribution function and charge correlation function, the conduction electrons are shown to behave like free spinless fermions in the ferromagnetic phase. We finally discuss the effect of the repulsive Hubbard interaction between conduction electrons. Our work enriches the Kondo physics and deepens the current understanding of the heavy fermion compounds.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00432'&gt;arXiv:2401.00432&lt;/a&gt;] Published Sun, 31 Dec 2023 09:04:36 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Magnetic properties at various fillings of the quasiflat band in a fermionic two-leg ladder model</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00483</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Paban Kumar Patra, Yixuan Huang, Hridis K. Pal&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; A recent study has demonstrated that a fermionic two-leg ladder model, threaded by a flux and characterized by a spatially varying interleg hopping term, gives rise to a quasiflat low-energy band. This band exhibits an unusual ground state at half filling in the presence of interaction -- a ferromagnetic Mott insulator. In this paper, we extend the study of this model to other fillings of the quasiflat band and explore the magnetic properties of the ground state at these fillings. In particular, we study four fillings: one-quarter, three-quarters, slightly above half filling (half filling plus two electrons), and slightly below half-filling (half filling minus two electrons). Incorporating interaction within the Hubbard model and using the Density Matrix Renormalization Group method to find the ground states, we find that the spin-spin correlation is ferromagnetic at fillings less than half, similar to that observed at half filling, but is antiferromagnetic beyond half filling. Interestingly, these results hold only when mixing between the lowest quasiflat band and the next-to-lowest dispersive band is negligible; once mixing between the two bands is facilitated by increasing the interaction strength, the correlation becomes ferromagnetic above half filling as well. Additionally, by reducing the strength of the interaction in comparison to the bandwidth, a transition from the ferromagnetic to the antiferromagnetic state is observed in all the cases.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00483'&gt;arXiv:2401.00483&lt;/a&gt;] Published Sun, 31 Dec 2023 12:56:09 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Tensor Networks for Explainable Machine Learning in Cybersecurity</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00867</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Borja Aizpurua, Samuel Palmer, Roman Orus&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; In this paper we show how tensor networks help in developing explainability of machine learning algorithms. Specifically, we develop an unsupervised clustering algorithm based on Matrix Product States (MPS) and apply it in the context of a real use-case of adversary-generated threat intelligence. Our investigation proves that MPS rival traditional deep learning models such as autoencoders and GANs in terms of performance, while providing much richer model interpretability. Our approach naturally facilitates the extraction of feature-wise probabilities, Von Neumann Entropy, and mutual information, offering a compelling narrative for classification of anomalies and fostering an unprecedented level of transparency and interpretability, something fundamental to understand the rationale behind artificial intelligence decisions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00867'&gt;arXiv:2401.00867&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 29 Dec 2023 22:35:45 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>To Wedge Or Not To Wedge, Wedges and operator reconstructability in toy models of AdS/CFT</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01287</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Vic Vander Linden&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The AdS/CFT correspondence is an explicit realization of the holographic principle relating a theory of gravity in a volume of space to a lower dimensional quantum field theory on its boundary. By exploiting elements of quantum error correction, qubit toy models of this correspondence have been constructed for which the bulk logical operators are representable by operators acting on the boundary. Given a boundary subregion, wedges in the volume space are used to enclose the bulk qubits for which logical operators are reconstructable on that boundary subregion. In this thesis a number of different wedges, such as the causal wedge, greedy entanglement wedge and minimum entanglement wedge, are examined. More specifically, Monte-Carlo simulations of boundary erasure are performed with various toy models to study the differences between wedges and the effect on these wedge by the type of the model, non-uniform boundaries and stacking of models. It has been found that the minimum entanglement wedge is the best approximate for the true geometric wedge. This is illustrated by an example toy model for which an operator beyond the greedy entanglement wedge was also reconstructed. In addition, by calculating the entropy of these subregions, the viability of a mutual information wedge is rejected. Only for particular connected boundary subregions was the inclusion of the central tensor by the geometric wedge associated to a rise in mutual information.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01287'&gt;arXiv:2401.01287&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 02 Jan 2024 16:54:59 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>A Knowledge Compilation Map for Quantum Information</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01322</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Lieuwe Vinkhuijzen, Tim Coopmans, Alfons Laarman&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Quantum computing is finding promising applications in optimization, machine learning and physics, leading to the development of various models for representing quantum information. Because these representations are often studied in different contexts (many-body physics, machine learning, formal verification, simulation), little is known about fundamental trade-offs between their succinctness and the runtime of operations to update them. We therefore analytically investigate three widely-used quantum state representations: matrix product states (MPS), decision diagrams (DDs), and restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs). We map the relative succinctness of these data structures and provide the complexity for relevant query and manipulation operations. Further, to chart the balance between succinctness and operation efficiency, we extend the concept of rapidity with support for the non-canonical data structures studied in this work, showing in particular that MPS is at least as rapid as some DDs. By providing a knowledge compilation map for quantum state representations, this paper contributes to the understanding of the inherent time and space efficiency trade-offs in this area.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01322'&gt;arXiv:2401.01322&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 02 Jan 2024 18:23:35 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Boosting Defect Detection in Manufacturing using Tensor Convolutional Neural Networks</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01373</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Pablo Martin-Ramiro, Unai Sainz de la Maza, Sukhbinder Singh, Roman Orus, Samuel Mugel&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Defect detection is one of the most important yet challenging tasks in the quality control stage in the manufacturing sector. In this work, we introduce a Tensor Convolutional Neural Network (T-CNN) and examine its performance on a real defect detection application in one of the components of the ultrasonic sensors produced at Robert Bosch's manufacturing plants. Our quantum-inspired T-CNN operates on a reduced model parameter space to substantially improve the training speed and performance of an equivalent CNN model without sacrificing accuracy. More specifically, we demonstrate how T-CNNs are able to reach the same performance as classical CNNs as measured by quality metrics, with up to fifteen times fewer parameters and 4% to 19% faster training times. Our results demonstrate that the T-CNN greatly outperforms the results of traditional human visual inspection, providing value in a current real application in manufacturing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01373'&gt;arXiv:2401.01373&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 29 Dec 2023 15:47:22 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>A quatum inspired neural network for geometric modeling</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01801</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Weitao Du, Shengchao Liu, Xuecang Zhang&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; By conceiving physical systems as 3D many-body point clouds, geometric graph neural networks (GNNs), such as SE(3)/E(3) equivalent GNNs, have showcased promising performance. In particular, their effective message-passing mechanics make them adept at modeling molecules and crystalline materials. However, current geometric GNNs only offer a mean-field approximation of the many-body system, encapsulated within two-body message passing, thus falling short in capturing intricate relationships within these geometric graphs. To address this limitation, tensor networks, widely employed by computational physics to handle manybody systems using high-order tensors, have been introduced. Nevertheless, integrating these tensorized networks into the message-passing framework of GNNs faces scalability and symmetry conservation (e.g., permutation and rotation) challenges. In response, we introduce an innovative equivariant Matrix Product State (MPS)-based message-passing strategy, through achieving an efficient implementation of the tensor contraction operation. Our method effectively models complex many-body relationships, suppressing mean-field approximations, and captures symmetries within geometric graphs. Importantly, it seamlessly replaces the standard message-passing and layer-aggregation modules intrinsic to geometric GNNs. We empirically validate the superior accuracy of our approach on benchmark tasks, including predicting classical Newton systems and quantum tensor Hamiltonian matrices. To our knowledge, our approach represents the inaugural utilization of parameterized geometric tensor networks.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01801'&gt;arXiv:2401.01801&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 03 Jan 2024 15:59:35 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>The Cytnx Library for Tensor Networks</title>

This library provides almost an identical interface and syntax for both C++ and Python, allowing users to effortlessly switch between two languages. Aiming at a quick learning process for new users of tensor network algorithms, the interfaces resemble the popular Python scientific libraries like NumPy, Scipy, and PyTorch. Not only multiple global Abelian symmetries can be easily defined and implemented, Cytnx also provides a new tool called Network that allows users to store large tensor networks and perform tensor network contractions in an optimal order automatically. With the integration of cuQuantum, tensor calculations can also be executed efficiently on GPUs. We present benchmark results for tensor operations on both devices, CPU and GPU. We also discuss features and higher-level interfaces to be added in the future.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01921'&gt;arXiv:2401.01921&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 03 Jan 2024 14:59:50 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Entanglement and confinement in lattice gauge theory tensor networks</title>

It is explicitly shown how the long-range behavior of these quantities gives rise to an entanglement area law in both the thermodynamic limit and in the continuum. We numerically demonstrate the applicability of our method to the $Z_2$ lattice gauge theory and relate some entanglement properties to the confinement-deconfinement transition therein. We provide evidence that Rényi entanglement entropies in certain cases do not provide a complete probe of (de)confinement properties compared to Wilson loop expectation values as other genuine (nonlocal) observables.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01930'&gt;arXiv:2401.01930&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 03 Jan 2024 19:00:01 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Superselection-Resolved Entanglement in Lattice Gauge Theories: A Tensor Network Approach</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01942</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Noa Feldman, Johannes Knaute, Erez Zohar, Moshe Goldstein&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Lattice gauge theories (LGT) play a central role in modern physics, providing insights into high-energy physics, condensed matter physics, and quantum computation. Due to the nontrivial structure of the Hilbert space of LGT systems, entanglement in such systems is tricky to define. However, when one limits themselves to superselection-resolved entanglement, that is, entanglement corresponding to specific gauge symmetry sectors (commonly denoted as superselection sectors), this problem disappears, and the entanglement becomes well-defined. The study of superselection-resolved entanglement is interesting in LGT for an additional reason: when the gauge symmetry is strictly obeyed, superselection-resolved entanglement becomes the only distillable contribution to the entanglement. In our work, we study the behavior of superselection-resolved entanglement in LGT systems. We employ a tensor network construction for gauge-invariant systems as defined by Zohar and Burrello (2016) and find that, in a vast range of cases, the leading term in superselection-resolved entanglement depends on the number of corners in the partition, that is, corner-law entanglement. To our knowledge, this is the first case of such a corner-law being observed in any lattice system.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01942'&gt;arXiv:2401.01942&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 03 Jan 2024 19:03:04 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>On Complexity of Stability Analysis in Higher-order Ecological Networks through Tensor Decompositions</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Anqi Dong, Can Chen&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Complex ecological networks are often characterized by intricate interactions that extend beyond pairwise relationships. Understanding the stability of higher-order ecological networks is salient for species coexistence, biodiversity, and community persistence. In this article, we present complexity analyses for determining the linear stability of higher-order ecological networks through tensor decompositions. We are interested in the higher-order generalized Lotka-Volterra model, which captures high-order interactions using tensors of varying orders. To efficiently compute Jacobian matrices and thus determine stability in large ecological networks, we exploit various tensor decompositions, including higher-order singular value decomposition, Canonical Polyadic decomposition, and tensor train decomposition, accompanied by in-depth computational and memory complexity analyses. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework with numerical examples.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02023'&gt;arXiv:2401.02023&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 04 Jan 2024 01:50:00 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Matrix product state ansatz for the variational quantum solution of the Heisenberg model on Kagome geometries</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Younes Javanmard, Ugne Liaubaite, Tobias J. Osborne, Xusheng Xu, Man-Hong Yung&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) algorithm, as applied to finding the ground state of a Hamiltonian, is particularly well-suited for deployment on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. Here we utilize the VQE algorithm with a quantum circuit ansatz inspired by the Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) algorithm. To ameliorate the impact of realistic noise on the performance of the method we employ zero-noise extrapolation. We find that, with realistic error rates, our DMRG-VQE hybrid algorithm delivers good results for strongly correlated systems. We illustrate our approach with the Heisenberg model on a Kagome lattice patch and demonstrate that DMRG-VQE hybrid methods can locate, and faithfully represent the physics of, the ground state of such systems. Moreover, the parameterized ansatz circuit used in this work is low-depth and requires a reasonably small number of parameters, so is efficient for NISQ devices.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02355'&gt;arXiv:2401.02355&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 04 Jan 2024 16:53:47 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Link-area commutators in AdS${}_3$ area-networks</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02487</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Jesse Held, Molly Kaplan, Donald Marolf, Jie-qiang Wu&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Random tensor networks (RTNs) have proved to be fruitful tools for modelling the AdS/CFT correspondence. Due to their flat entanglement spectra, when discussing a given boundary region $R$ and its complement $\bar R$, standard RTNs are most analogous to fixed-area states of the bulk quantum gravity theory, in which quantum fluctuations have been suppressed for the area of the corresponding HRT surface. However, such RTNs have flat entanglement spectra for all choices of $R, \bar R,$ while quantum fluctuations of multiple HRT-areas can be suppressed only when the corresponding HRT-area operators mutually commute. We probe the severity of such obstructions in pure AdS$_3$ Einstein-Hilbert gravity by constructing networks whose links are codimension-2 extremal-surfaces and by explicitly computing semiclassical commutators of the associated link-areas. Since $d=3,$ codimension-2 extremal-surfaces are geodesics, and codimension-2 `areas' are lengths. We find a simple 4-link network defined by an HRT surface and a Chen-Dong-Lewkowycz-Qi constrained HRT surface for which all link-areas commute. However, the algebra generated by the link-areas of more general networks tends to be non-Abelian. One such non-Abelian example is associated with entanglement-wedge cross sections and may be of more general interest.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02487'&gt;arXiv:2401.02487&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 04 Jan 2024 19:00:21 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Liouvillian recursion method for the electronic Green's function</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02527</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Alexandre Foley&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; In this paper, we present a framework for the recursion method applied within the Liouvillian formalism, enabling the computation of response functions for a wide range of quantum operators. Indeed, unlike most previous literature on the Liouvillian recursion method, this framework readily computes electronic Green's function. We demonstrate the method by showcasing its application to a temperature dependence study of a $2\times2$ Hubbard model. Our results show that the recursion method accurately computes response functions and provides valuable insights into quantum many-body systems. While the method has already been successfully applied to study of condensed matter, further efforts are required to develop efficient algorithms for larger and more realistic systems. Tensor network methods and other variational techniques hold promise for tackling these challenges. Overall, the recursion method offers a flexible approach for investigating strongly correlated system.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02527'&gt;arXiv:2401.02527&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 04 Jan 2024 20:30:06 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Guaranteed Nonconvex Factorization Approach for Tensor Train Recovery</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02592</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Zhen Qin, Michael B. Wakin, Zhihui Zhu&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; In this paper, we provide the first convergence guarantee for the factorization approach. Specifically, to avoid the scaling ambiguity and to facilitate theoretical analysis, we optimize over the so-called left-orthogonal TT format which enforces orthonormality among most of the factors. To ensure the orthonormal structure, we utilize the Riemannian gradient descent (RGD) for optimizing those factors over the Stiefel manifold. We first delve into the TT factorization problem and establish the local linear convergence of RGD. Notably, the rate of convergence only experiences a linear decline as the tensor order increases. We then study the sensing problem that aims to recover a TT format tensor from linear measurements. Assuming the sensing operator satisfies the restricted isometry property (RIP), we show that with a proper initialization, which could be obtained through spectral initialization, RGD also converges to the ground-truth tensor at a linear rate. Furthermore, we expand our analysis to encompass scenarios involving Gaussian noise in the measurements. We prove that RGD can reliably recover the ground truth at a linear rate, with the recovery error exhibiting only polynomial growth in relation to the tensor order. We conduct various experiments to validate our theoretical findings.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02592'&gt;arXiv:2401.02592&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 05 Jan 2024 01:17:16 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Spin-1/2 kagome Heisenberg antiferromagnet: Machine learning discovery of the spinon pair density wave ground state</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02866</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Tanja Duric, Jia Hui Chung, Bo Yang, Pinaki Sengupta&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Spin-1/2 kagome antiferromagnet (AFM) is one of the most studied models in frustrated magnetism since it is a promising candidate to host exotic spin liquid states. However, despite numerous studies using both analytical and numerical approaches, the nature of the ground state and low-energy excitations in this system remain elusive. This is related to the difficulty in determining the spin gap in various calculations. We present the results of our investigation of the Kagome AFM using the recently developed group equivariant convolutional neural networks, a novel machine learning technique for studying strongly frustrated models. The approach, combined with variational Monte Carlo, introduces significant improvement of the achievable results accuracy for frustrated spin systems in comparison with approaches based on other neural network architectures. Contrary to the results obtained previously with various methods, that predicted $Z_2$ or U(1) Dirac spin liquid states, our results strongly indicate that the ground state of the kagome lattice antiferromagnet is a spinon pair density wave that does not break time-reversal symmetry or any of the lattice symmetries. The found state appears due to the spinon Cooper pairing instability close to two Dirac points in the spinon energy spectrum and resembles the pair density wave state studied previously in the context of underdoped cuprate superconductors in connection with the pseudogap phase. The state has significantly lower energy than the lowest energy states found by the SU(2) symmetric density matrix renormalization group calculations and other methods.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02866'&gt;arXiv:2401.02866&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 05 Jan 2024 15:49:25 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Quantum criticality in chains of planar rotors with dipolar interactions</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Tobias Serwatka, Pierre-Nicholas Roy&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; In this contribution we perform a density matrix renormalization group study of chains of planar rotors interacting via dipolar interactions. By exploring the ground state from weakly to strongly interacting rotors, we find the occurrence of a quantum phase transition between a disordered and a dipole-ordered quantum state. We show that the nature of the ordered state changes from ferroelectric to antiferroelectric when the relative orientation of the rotor planes varies and that this change requires no modification of the overall symmetry. The observed quantum phase transitions are characterized by critical exponents and central charges which reveal different universality classes ranging from that of the (1+1)D Ising model to the 2D classical XY model.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02887'&gt;arXiv:2401.02887&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 05 Jan 2024 16:29:36 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Ground state energy and magnetization curve of a frustrated magnetic system from real-time evolution on a digital quantum processor</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03015</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Aaron Szasz, Ed Younis, Wibe Albert de Jong&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Models of interacting many-body quantum systems that may realize new exotic phases of matter, notably quantum spin liquids, are challenging to study using even state-of-the-art classical methods such as tensor network simulations. Quantum computing provides a promising route for overcoming these difficulties to find ground states, dynamics, and more. In this paper, we argue that recently developed hybrid quantum-classical algorithms based on real-time evolution are promising methods for solving a particularly important model in the search for spin liquids, the antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model on the two-dimensional kagome lattice. We show how to construct efficient quantum circuits to implement time evolution for the model and to evaluate key observables on the quantum computer, and we argue that the method has favorable scaling with increasing system size. We then restrict to a 12-spin star plaquette from the kagome lattice and a related 8-spin system, and we give an empirical demonstration on these small systems that the hybrid algorithms can efficiently find the ground state energy and the magnetization curve. For these demonstrations, we use four levels of approximation: exact state vectors, exact state vectors with statistical noise from sampling, noisy classical emulators, and (for the 8-spin system only) real quantum hardware, specifically the Quantinuum H1-1 processor; for the noisy simulations and hardware demonstration, we also employ error mitigation strategies based on the symmetries of the Hamiltonian. Our results strongly suggest that these hybrid algorithms present a promising direction for studying quantum spin liquids and more generally for resolving important unsolved problems in condensed matter theory and beyond.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03015'&gt;arXiv:2401.03015&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 05 Jan 2024 18:57:34 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>conv_einsum: A Framework for Representation and Fast Evaluation of Multilinear Operations in Convolutional Tensorial Neural Networks</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03384</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Tahseen Rabbani, Jiahao Su, Xiaoyu Liu, David Chan, Geoffrey Sangston, Furong Huang&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Modern ConvNets continue to achieve state-of-the-art results over a vast array of vision and image classification tasks, but at the cost of increasing parameters. One strategy for compactifying a network without sacrificing much expressive power is to reshape it into a tensorial neural network (TNN), which is a higher-order tensorization of its layers, followed by a factorization, such as a CP-decomposition, which strips a weight down to its critical basis components. Passes through TNNs can be represented as sequences of multilinear operations (MLOs), where the evaluation path can greatly affect the number of floating point operations (FLOPs) incurred. While functions such as the popular einsum can evaluate simple MLOs such as contractions, existing implementations cannot process multi-way convolutions, resulting in scant assessments of how optimal evaluation paths through tensorized convolutional layers can improve training speed. In this paper, we develop a unifying framework for representing tensorial convolution layers as einsum-like strings and a meta-algorithm conv_einsum which is able to evaluate these strings in a FLOPs-minimizing manner. Comprehensive experiments, using our open-source implementation, over a wide range of models, tensor decompositions, and diverse tasks, demonstrate that conv_einsum significantly increases both computational and memory-efficiency of convolutional TNNs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03384'&gt;arXiv:2401.03384&lt;/a&gt;] Published Sun, 07 Jan 2024 04:30:12 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Ground state phase diagram and the exotic phases in the spin-1/2 square lattice J1-J2-Jx model</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03434</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Jianwei Yang, Zhao Liu, Ling Wang&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The intricate interplay between frustration and spin chirality has the potential to give rise to unprecedented phases in frustrated quantum magnets. We examine the ground state phase diagram of the spin-1/2 square lattice J1-J2-Jx model by employing critical level crossings and ground state fidelity susceptibility (FS) using exact diagonalization (ED) with full lattice symmetries. Our analysis reveals the evolution of highly symmetric energy levels as a function of J2 at fixed Jx. During a magnetic to non-magnetic phase transition, the precise identification of the phase boundary is achieved through critical level crossings between the gapless excitation of a magnetic phase and the quasi-degenerate ground state of a non-magnet phase. Conversely, a direct transition between two non-magnetic phases is characterized by a FS peak accompanied by an avoided ground state level crossing, serving as a distinctive signal. Within a substantial range of Jx, we identify an anticipated chiral spin liquid (CSL) state and an adjacent nematic spin liquid (NSL) phase with a degeneracy of two on a cylinder. These two phases are demarcated by a nearly vertical boundary line at J2 = 0.65. This critical line terminates at the lower boundary of a magnetic ordered chiral spin solid (CSS) phase. We validate the topological nature of the CSL using the modular S matrix of the minimum entangled states (MES) on a torus, along with the entanglement spectra (ES) of even and odd sectors on a cylinder, employing an SU(2)-symmetric density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) method. Furthermore, we delve into a comprehensive discussion on the nature of the NSL, exploring aspects such as ground state degeneracy, the local bond energy landscape, and the singlet and triplet gaps on various tori. These analysis provide substantial evidence supporting the nematic nature of the NSL.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03434'&gt;arXiv:2401.03434&lt;/a&gt;] Published Sun, 07 Jan 2024 09:28:34 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>A Tensor Network Implementation of Multi Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03896</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Sunny Howard&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Recently it has been shown that tensor networks (TNs) have the ability to represent the expected return of a single-agent finite Markov decision process (FMDP). The TN represents a distribution model, where all possible trajectories are considered. When extending these ideas to a multi-agent setting, distribution models suffer from the curse of dimensionality: the exponential relation between the number of possible trajectories and the number of agents. The key advantage of using TNs in this setting is that there exists a large number of established optimisation and decomposition techniques that are specific to TNs, that one can apply to ensure the most efficient representation is found. In this report, these methods are used to form a TN that represents the expected return of a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) task. This model is then applied to a 2 agent random walker example, where it was shown that the policy is correctly optimised using a DMRG technique. Finally, I demonstrate the use of an exact decomposition technique, reducing the number of elements in the tensors by 97.5%, without experiencing any loss of information.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03896'&gt;arXiv:2401.03896&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 08 Jan 2024 13:50:49 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Exact results on finite size corrections for surface codes tailored to biased noise</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04008</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Yinzi Xiao, Basudha Srivastava, Mats Granath&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The code-capacity threshold of a scalable quantum error correcting stabilizer code can be expressed as a thermodynamic phase transition of a corresponding random-bond Ising model. Here we study the XY and XZZX surface codes under phase-biased noise, $p_x=p_y=p_z/(2\eta)$, with $\eta\geq 1/2$, and total error rate $p=p_x+p_y+p_z$. By appropriately formulating the boundary conditions, in the rotated code geometry, we find exact solutions at a special disordered point, $p=\frac{1+\eta^{-1}}{2+\eta^{-1}}\gtrsim 0.5$, for arbitrary odd code distance $d$, where the codes reduce to one-dimensional Ising models. The total logical failure rate is given by $P_{f}=\frac{3}{4}-\frac{1}{4}e^{-2d_Z\,\text{artanh}(1/2\eta)}$, where $d_{Z}=d^2$ and $d$ for the two codes respectively, is the effective code distance for pure phase-flip noise. As a consequence, for code distances $d\ll \eta$, and error rates near the threshold, the XZZX code is effectively equivalent to the phase-flip correcting repetition code over $d$ qubits. The large finite size corrections for $d_Z&lt;\eta$ also make threshold extractions, from numerical calculations at moderate code distances, unreliable. We show that calculating thresholds based not only on the total logical failure rate, but also independently on the phase- and bit-flip logical failure rates, gives a more confident estimate. Using this method for the XZZX code with a tensor-network based decoder and code distances up to $d\approx 100$, we find that the thresholds converge to a single value at moderate bias ($\eta=30, 100$), at an error rate above the hashing bound.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04008'&gt;arXiv:2401.04008&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 08 Jan 2024 16:38:56 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Escaping fronts in local quenches of a confining spin chain</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; A. Krasznai, G. Takács&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We consider local quenches from initial states generated by a single spin-flip in either the true or the false vacuum state of the confining quantum Ising spin chain in the ferromagnetic regime. Contrary to global quenches, where the light-cone behaviour is strongly suppressed, we find a significant light-cone signal propagating with a nonzero velocity besides the expected localised oscillating component. Combining an analytic representation of the initial state with a numerical description of the relevant excitations using the two-fermion approximation, we can construct the spectrum of post-quench excitations and their overlaps with the initial state, identifying the underlying mechanism. For confining quenches built upon the true vacuum, the propagating signal consists of superpositions of left and right-moving mesons escaping confinement. In contrast, for anti-confining quenches built upon the false vacuum it is composed of superpositions of left and right-moving bubbles which escape Wannier-Stark localisation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04193'&gt;arXiv:2401.04193&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 08 Jan 2024 19:16:04 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>3D Tensor Renormalisation Group at High Temperatures</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Nikolay Ebel&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Building upon previous $2D$ studies, this research focuses on describing $3D$ tensor renormalisation group (RG) flows for lattice spin systems, such as the Ising model. We present a novel RG map, which operates on tensors with infinite-dimensional legs and does not involve truncations, in contrast to numerical tensor RG maps. To construct this map, we developed new techniques for analysing tensor networks. Our analysis shows that the constructed RG map contracts the region around the tensor $A_*$, corresponding to the high-temperature phase of the $3D$ Ising model. This leads to the iterated RG map convergence in the Hilbert-Schmidt norm to $A_*$ when initialised in the vicinity of $A_*$. This work provides the first steps towards the rigorous understanding of tensor RG maps in $3D$.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04229'&gt;arXiv:2401.04229&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 08 Jan 2024 20:39:17 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>CoNST: Code Generator for Sparse Tensor Networks</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04836</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Saurabh Raje, Yufan Xu, Atanas Rountev, Edward F. Valeev, Saday Sadayappan&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Sparse tensor networks are commonly used to represent contractions over sparse tensors. Tensor contractions are higher-order analogs of matrix multiplication. Tensor networks arise commonly in many domains of scientific computing and data science. After a transformation into a tree of binary contractions, the network is implemented as a sequence of individual contractions. Several critical aspects must be considered in the generation of efficient code for a contraction tree, including sparse tensor layout mode order, loop fusion to reduce intermediate tensors, and the interdependence of loop order, mode order, and contraction order. We propose CoNST, a novel approach that considers these factors in an integrated manner using a single formulation. Our approach creates a constraint system that encodes these decisions and their interdependence, while aiming to produce reduced-order intermediate tensors via fusion. The constraint system is solved by the Z3 SMT solver and the result is used to create the desired fused loop structure and tensor mode layouts for the entire contraction tree. This structure is lowered to the IR of the TACO compiler, which is then used to generate executable code. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates very significant (sometimes orders of magnitude) performance improvements over current state-of-the-art sparse tensor compiler/library alternatives.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04836'&gt;arXiv:2401.04836&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 09 Jan 2024 22:00:15 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Real-time Impurity Solver Using Grassmann Time-Evolving Matrix Product Operators</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04880</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Ruofan Chen, Xiansong Xu, Chu Guo&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; An emergent and promising tensor-network-based impurity solver is to represent the path integral as a matrix product state, where the bath is analytically integrated out using Feynman-Vernon influence functional. Here we present an approach to calculate the equilibrium impurity spectral function based on the recently proposed Grassmann time-evolving matrix product operators method. The central idea is to perform a quench from a separable impurity-bath initial state as in the non-equilibrium scenario. The retarded Green's function $G(t+t_0, t'+t_0)$ is then calculated after an equilibration time $t_0$ such that the impurity and bath are approximately in thermal equilibrium. There are two major advantages of this method. First, since we focus on real-time dynamics, we do not need to perform the numerically ill-posed analytic continuation in the continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo case that relies on imaginary-time evolution. Second, the entanglement growth of the matrix product states in real-time calculations is observed to be much slower than that in imaginary-time calculations, leading to a significant improvement in numerical efficiency. The accuracy of this method is demonstrated in the single-orbital Anderson impurity model and benchmarked against the continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo method.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04880'&gt;arXiv:2401.04880&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 10 Jan 2024 02:20:29 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

Embarking to parameter regimes beyond the exact dimer singlet ground state with a dimer bond spin exchange coupling $J_d$ varied against the exchange strength $J$ of all other bonds, iDMRG (NQS) finds a dimer state paramagnetic phase for $J_d/J &gt; 1.464$ ($J_d/J &gt; 1.39$) and a canted $120^\circ$ magnetic order for $J_d/J &lt; 1.419$ ($J_d/J &lt; 1.23$). Assessing training convergence inaccuracies of NQS and the influence of finite cylindric circumference for iDMRG, we discuss the possible existence of an intermediate phase between magnet and dimer paramagnet.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04995'&gt;arXiv:2401.04995&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 10 Jan 2024 08:26:34 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Classical verification of a quantum simulator: local relaxation of a 1D Bose gas</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05301</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Paul Secular&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; In [Nat. Phys. 8, 325-330 (2012)], Trotzky et al. utilize ultracold atoms in an optical lattice to simulate the local relaxation dynamics of a strongly interacting Bose gas "for longer times than present classical algorithms can keep track of". Here, I classically verify the results of this analog quantum simulator by calculating the evolution of the same quasi-local observables up to the time at which they appear "fully relaxed". Using a parallel implementation of the time-evolving block decimation (TEBD) algorithm to simulate the system on a supercomputer, I show that local densities and currents can be calculated in a matter of days rather than weeks. The precision of these numerics allows me to observe deviations from the conjectured power-law decay and to determine the effects of the harmonic trapping potential. As well as providing a robust benchmark for future experimental, theoretical, and numerical methods, this work serves as an example of the independent verification process.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05301'&gt;arXiv:2401.05301&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 10 Jan 2024 18:07:03 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>State of practice: evaluating GPU performance of state vector and tensor network methods</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06188</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Marzio Vallero, Flavio Vella, Paolo Rech&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The frontier of quantum computing (QC) simulation on classical hardware is quickly reaching the hard scalability limits for computational feasibility. Nonetheless, there is still a need to simulate large quantum systems classically, as the Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices are yet to be considered fault tolerant and performant enough in terms of operations per second. Each of the two main exact simulation techniques, state vector and tensor network simulators, boasts specific limitations. The exponential memory requirement of state vector simulation, when compared to the qubit register sizes of currently available quantum computers, quickly saturates the capacity of the top HPC machines currently available. Tensor network contraction approaches, which encode quantum circuits into tensor networks and then contract them over an output bit string to obtain its probability amplitude, still fall short of the inherent complexity of finding an optimal contraction path, which maps to a max-cut problem on a dense mesh, a notably NP-hard problem. This article aims at investigating the limits of current state-of-the-art simulation techniques on a test bench made of eight widely used quantum subroutines, each in 31 different configurations, with special emphasis on performance. We then correlate the performance measures of the simulators with the metrics that characterise the benchmark circuits, identifying the main reasons behind the observed performance trend. From our observations, given the structure of a quantum circuit and the number of qubits, we highlight how to select the best simulation strategy, obtaining a speedup of up to an order of magnitude.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06188'&gt;arXiv:2401.06188&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 11 Jan 2024 09:22:21 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Density-Matrix Mean-Field Theory</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06236</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Junyi Zhang, Zhengqian Cheng&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Mean-field theories have proven to be efficient tools for exploring diverse phases of matter, complementing alternative methods that are more precise but also more computationally demanding. Conventional mean-field theories often fall short in capturing quantum fluctuations, which restricts their applicability to systems with significant quantum effects. In this article, we propose an improved mean-field theory, density-matrix mean-field theory (DMMFT). DMMFT constructs effective Hamiltonians, incorporating quantum environments shaped by entanglements, quantified by the reduced density matrices. Therefore, it offers a systematic and unbiased approach to account for the effects of fluctuations and entanglements in quantum ordered phases. As demonstrative examples, we show that DMMFT can not only quantitatively evaluate the renormalization of order parameters induced by quantum fluctuations, but can also detect the topological quantum phases. Additionally, we discuss the extensions of DMMFT for systems at finite temperatures and those with disorders. Our work provides an efficient approach to explore phases exhibiting unconventional quantum orders, which can be particularly beneficial for investigating frustrated spin systems in high spatial dimensions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06236'&gt;arXiv:2401.06236&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 11 Jan 2024 19:31:56 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Katsumasa Nakayama&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We study the tensor renormalization group (TRG) in the dimension larger than two as the Higher-order TRG (HOTRG) with the randomized SVD method. The randomized SVD and the detailed discussion on the low order tensor representation, we can calculate the HOTRG with the reduced computational cost. We also represent our method by using the cost function, and the details of the cost function for the isometry determine the precision, stability, and calculation time. In our study, we show calculation order improvement using randomized SVD. We also propose that the internal line respect for any TRG method improves the calculation without changing the order of the computational cost.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06389'&gt;arXiv:2401.06389&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 12 Jan 2024 06:01:49 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Hidehiro Saito, Chisa Hotta&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Quantum anisotropic exchange interactions in magnets can induce competitions between phases in a different manner from those typically driven by geometrically frustrated interactions. We study a one-dimensional spin-1/2 zigzag chain with such an interaction, $\Gamma$-term, in conjunction with the Heisenberg interactions. We find a ground state phase diagram featuring a multicritical point where five phases converge: a uniform ferromagnet, two antiferromagnets, Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid and a dimer-singlet coexisting with nematic order. This multicritical point is simultaneously quantum tricritical and Lifshitz, and most remarkably, it hosts multi-degenerate ground state wave functions, whose exact form is obtained in the matrix product form and its degeneracy increases in squares of system size.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06551'&gt;arXiv:2401.06551&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 12 Jan 2024 12:55:57 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Incremental SWAP Operator for Entanglement Entropy: Application for Exponential Observables in Quantum Monte Carlo Simulation</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Xuan Zhou, Zi Yang Meng, Yang Qi, Yuan Da Liao&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We propose a new method to efficiently compute the entanglement entropy (EE) of quantum many-body systems. Our approach, called the incremental SWAP operator method , combines the simplicity of the SWAP operator used in projector quantum Monte Carlo simulations with recent advances in precisely computing exponential observables using incremental algorithms. We apply this technique to obtain accurate EE data at reduced computational cost for 1d and 2d antiferromagnetic Heisenberg models with different bipartition schemes. Using the computed EE data, we extract the area law coefficient, universal logarithmic corrections from Goldstone modes, and the geometric constant, finding quantitative agreement with analytical predictions. Moreover, for the first time in an unbiased numerical simulation of 2d antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model, we successfully obtain reliable universal logarithmic corrections from sharp corners that match expected theoretical values. The consistency between our numerical results and theoretical calculations demonstrates the power of our approach for accessing challenging universal entanglement properties. The extensions of our method to other quantum spin/boson models and the interacting fermion models, are outlined.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07244'&gt;arXiv:2401.07244&lt;/a&gt;] Published Sun, 14 Jan 2024 10:28:21 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

Sotnikov&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We develop a new methodology to contract tensor networks within the corner transfer matrix renormalization group approach for a wide range of two-dimensional lattice geometries. We discuss contraction algorithms on the example of triangular, kagome, honeycomb, square-octagon, star, ruby, square-hexagon-dodecahedron, and dice lattices. As benchmark tests, we apply the developed method to the classical Ising model on different lattices and observe a remarkable agreement of the results with the available from the literature. The approach also shows the necessary potential to be applied to various quantum lattice models in a combination with the wave-function variational optimization schemes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07274'&gt;arXiv:2401.07274&lt;/a&gt;] Published Sun, 14 Jan 2024 12:14:16 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Chiral spin liquid and quantum phase diagram of spin-$1/2$ $J_1$-$J_2$-$J_χ$ model on the square lattice</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07461</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Xiao-Tian Zhang, Yixuan Huang, Han-Qing Wu, D. N. Sheng, Shou-Shu Gong&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We study the spin-$1/2$ Heisenberg model on the square lattice with the first and second nearest-neighbor antiferromagnetic couplings $J_1$, $J_2$, as well as the three-spin scalar chiral coupling $J_{\chi}$. Using density matrix renormalization group calculations, we obtain a quantum phase diagram of this system for $0 \leq J_2/J_1 \leq 1.0$ and $0 \leq J_{\chi}/J_1 \leq 1.5$. We identify the Néel and stripe magnetic order phase at small $J_{\chi}$ coupling. With growing $J_{\chi}$, we identify the emergent chiral spin liquid (CSL) phase characterized by the quantized spin Chern number $C = 1/2$ and entanglement spectrum with the quasidegenerate group of levels agreeing with chiral SU(2)$_1$ conformal field theory, which is an analog of the $\nu = 1/2$ Laughlin state in spin system. In the vicinity of the Néel and CSL phase boundary, our numerical results do not find evidence to support the phase coexistence of Néel order and topological order that was conjectured by mean-field calculations. In the larger $J_2$ and $J_{\chi}$ coupling regime, the entanglement spectrum of the ground state also exhibits the chiral quasidegeneracy consistent with a CSL, but the adiabatic flux insertion simulations fail to obtain the quantized Chern number. By analyzing the finite-size scaling of magnetic order parameter, we find the vanished magnetic order suggesting a magnetic disorder phase, whose nature needs further studies. Different from the spin-$1$ $J_1$-$J_2$-$J_\chi$ model, we do not find the coexistent stripe magnetic order and topological order. We also investigate the $J_{\chi}$ dominant regime and find a strong tendency of the system to develop a dimer order rather than the chiral spin magnetic order observed in the spin-$1$ model.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07461'&gt;arXiv:2401.07461&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 15 Jan 2024 04:13:16 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Low-spin ground state of the giant single-molecule magnets {Mn$_{70}$} and {Mn$_{84}$}</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07552</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; R. Rausch, C. Karrasch&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The single-molecule magnets {Mn$_{70}$} and {Mn$_{84}$} are characterized by a 14-site unit cell with $S=2$ spin sites arranged in a circular geometry. Experimentally, these systems exhibit a magnetic ground state with a notably low total spin $S_{\text{tot}}=5-7$. Up to now, this low-spin ground state has been up difficult to describe theoretically due to the complexity of the quantum Heisenberg model for such a large system. In this work, we fill this gap and demonstrate that the ground state of {Mn$_{70}$} and {Mn$_{84}$} is in fact governed by a small, finite $S_{\text{tot}}$ in quantitative agreement with the experiment. We employ accurate, large-scale SU(2)-symmetric density-matrix renormalization group calculations for a quantum Heisenberg model with previously published exchange parameters obtained by density-functional theory. We do not find a low-spin state for the same parameters and $S=1$ and thus propose that frustrated systems with $S\geq2$ are inherently prone to weak ferromagnetic interactions. This could account for the prevalence of similar low-spin Mn-based single-molecule magnets. Finally, we compute the full magnetization curve and find wide plateaus at 10/14, 11/14, 12/14 and 13/14 of the saturation, which can be traced back to nearly-independent 3-site clusters with broken inter-cluster bonds.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07552'&gt;arXiv:2401.07552&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 15 Jan 2024 09:29:55 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Three ways of calculating mass spectra for the 2-flavor Schwinger model in the Hamiltonian formalism</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Akira Matsumoto, Etsuko Itou, Yuya Tanizaki&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We propose three independent methods to compute the hadron mass spectra of gauge theories in the Hamiltonian formalism. The determination of hadron masses is one of the key issues in QCD, which has been precisely calculated by the Monte Carlo method in the Lagrangian formalism. We confirm that the mass of hadrons can be calculated by examining correlation functions, the one-point function, or the dispersion relation in Hamiltonian formalism. These methods are suitable for quantum computation and tensor network approaches. The methods are demonstrated with the tensor network (DMRG) in the 2-flavor Schwinger model, which shares important properties with QCD. We show that the numerical results are consistent with each other and with the analytic prediction of the bosonization technique. We also discuss their efficiency and potential applications to other models.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07556'&gt;arXiv:2401.07556&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 15 Jan 2024 09:43:37 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Parent Hamiltonian for Fully-augmented Matrix Product States</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07659</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Xiangjian Qian, Mingpu Qin&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) or matrix product states (MPS) is the most effective and accurate method for studying one-dimensional quantum many-body systems. However, the application of DMRG to two-dimensional systems is not as successful because of the limited entanglement encoded in the wave-function ansatz. The fully augmented matrix product states (FAMPS), introduced recently in [Chin. Phys. Lett. 40, 057102 (2023)], extends MPS formalism to two dimensions and increases the entanglement in the wave-function ansatz, representing a significant advance in the simulation of two-dimensional quantum many-body physics. In the study of one-dimensional systems, the concept of a parent Hamiltonian for MPS has proven pivotal in the understanding of quantum entanglement. In this work, we extend this framework to two-dimensional systems. We illustrate the procedure to construct a two-dimensional Hamiltonian with given FAMPS as its exact ground state (the parent Hamiltonian for FAMPS). Additionally, through numerical simulations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm outlined in [Chin. Phys. Lett. 40, 057102 (2023)] in precisely identifying the FAMPS for the constructed parent Hamiltonian. The introduction of FAMPS and its associated parent Hamiltonian provides a useful framework for the future investigations of two-dimensional quantum many-body systems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07659'&gt;arXiv:2401.07659&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 15 Jan 2024 13:03:07 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Tractable Optimal Experimental Design using Transport Maps</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07971</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Karina Koval, Roland Herzog, Robert Scheichl&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We present a flexible method for computing Bayesian optimal experimental designs (BOEDs) for inverse problems with intractable posteriors. The approach is applicable to a wide range of BOED problems and can accommodate various optimality criteria, prior distributions and noise models. The key to our approach is the construction of a transport-map-based surrogate to the joint probability law of the design, observational and inference random variables. This order-preserving transport map is constructed using tensor trains and can be used to efficiently sample from (and evaluate approximate densities of) conditional distributions that are required in the evaluation of many commonly-used optimality criteria. The algorithm is also extended to sequential data acquisition problems, where experiments can be performed in sequence to update the state of knowledge about the unknown parameters. The sequential BOED problem is made computationally feasible by preconditioning the approximation of the joint density at the current stage using transport maps constructed at previous stages. The flexibility of our approach in finding optimal designs is illustrated with some numerical examples inspired by disease modeling and the reconstruction of subsurface structures in aquifers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07971'&gt;arXiv:2401.07971&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 15 Jan 2024 21:29:26 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>TT-SNN: Tensor Train Decomposition for Efficient Spiking Neural Network Training</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08001</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Donghyun Lee, Ruokai Yin, Youngeun Kim, Abhishek Moitra, Yuhang Li, Priyadarshini Panda&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have gained significant attention as a potentially energy-efficient alternative for standard neural networks with their sparse binary activation. However, SNNs suffer from memory and computation overhead due to spatio-temporal dynamics and multiple backpropagation computations across timesteps during training. To address this issue, we introduce Tensor Train Decomposition for Spiking Neural Networks (TT-SNN), a method that reduces model size through trainable weight decomposition, resulting in reduced storage, FLOPs, and latency. In addition, we propose a parallel computation pipeline as an alternative to the typical sequential tensor computation, which can be flexibly integrated into various existing SNN architectures. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first of its kind application of tensor decomposition in SNNs. We validate our method using both static and dynamic datasets, CIFAR10/100 and N-Caltech101, respectively. We also propose a TT-SNN-tailored training accelerator to fully harness the parallelism in TT-SNN. Our results demonstrate substantial reductions in parameter size (7.98X), FLOPs (9.25X), training time (17.7%), and training energy (28.3%) during training for the N-Caltech101 dataset, with negligible accuracy degradation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08001'&gt;arXiv:2401.08001&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 15 Jan 2024 23:08:19 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Quantum Simulations of Hadron Dynamics in the Schwinger Model using 112 Qubits</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08044</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Roland C. Farrell, Marc Illa, Anthony N. Ciavarella, Martin J. Savage&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Hadron wavepackets are prepared and time evolved in the Schwinger model using 112 qubits of IBM's 133-qubit Heron quantum computer ibm_torino. The initialization of the hadron wavepacket is performed in two steps. First, the vacuum is prepared across the whole lattice using the recently developed SC-ADAPT-VQE algorithm and workflow. SC-ADAPT-VQE is then extended to the preparation of localized states, and used to establish a hadron wavepacket on top of the vacuum. This is done by adaptively constructing low-depth circuits that maximize the overlap with an adiabatically prepared hadron wavepacket. Due to the localized nature of the wavepacket, these circuits can be determined on a sequence of small lattices using classical computers, and then robustly scaled to prepare wavepackets on large lattices for simulations using quantum computers. Time evolution is implemented with a second-order Trotterization. To reduce both the required qubit connectivity and circuit depth, an approximate quasi-local interaction is introduced. This approximation is made possible by the emergence of confinement at long distances, and converges exponentially with increasing distance of the interactions. Using multiple error-mitigation strategies, up to 14 Trotter steps of time evolution are performed, employing 13,858 two-qubit gates (with a CNOT depth of 370). The propagation of hadrons is clearly identified, with results that compare favorably with Matrix Product State simulations. Prospects for a near-term quantum advantage in simulations of hadron scattering are discussed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08044'&gt;arXiv:2401.08044&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 16 Jan 2024 01:51:19 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Representation Learning on Event Stream via an Elastic Net-incorporated Tensor Network</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08068</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Beibei Yang, Weiling Li, Yan Fang&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Event cameras are neuromorphic sensors that capture asynchronous and sparse event stream when per-pixel brightness changes. The state-of-the-art processing methods for event signals typically aggregate events into a frame or a grid. However, events are dense in time, these works are limited to local information of events due to the stacking. In this paper, we present a novel spatiotemporal representation learning method which can capture the global correlations of all events in the event stream simultaneously by tensor decomposition. In addition, with the events are sparse in space, we propose an Elastic Net-incorporated tensor network (ENTN) model to obtain more spatial and temporal details about event stream. Empirically, the results indicate that our method can represent the spatiotemporal correlation of events with high quality, and can achieve effective results in applications like filtering noise compared with the state-of-the-art methods.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08068'&gt;arXiv:2401.08068&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 16 Jan 2024 02:51:47 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Ultrafast Excited-State Energy Transfer in Phenylene Ethynylene Dendrimer: Quantum Dynamics with Tensor Network Method</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08259</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Sisi Liu, Jiawei Peng, Peng Bao, Qiang Shi, Zhenggang Lan&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Photo-induced excited-state energy transfer (EET) processes play an important role in the solar energy conversions. The phenylene ethynylene (PE) dendrimers display great potential in improving the efficiency of solar cells, because of their excellent photo-harvesting and exciton-transport properties. In this work, we investigated the intramolecular EET dynamics in a dendrimer composed of two linear PE units (2-ring and 3-ring) using the full quantum dynamics based on the tensor network method. We first constructed a diabatic model Hamiltonian based on the electronic structure calculations. Using this diabatic vibronic coupling model, we tried to obtain the main features of the EET dynamics in terms of the several diabatic models with different numbers of vibrational modes (from 4 modes to 129 modes) and to explore the corresponding vibronic coupling interactions. The results show that the EET in the current PE dendrimer is an ultrafast process. Four modes with A' symmetry play dominant roles in the dynamics, other 86 modes with A' symmetry can damp the electronic coherence, and the modes of A" symmetry do not show the significant influence on the EET process. Overall, the first-order intrastate vibronic coupling terms show the dominant roles in the EET dynamics, while the second-order intrastate vibronic coupling terms give the visible impact here by damping the electronic coherence and slowing down the overall EET process. This work provides a valuable understanding of the physical insight in the EET dynamics of PE dendrimers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08259'&gt;arXiv:2401.08259&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 16 Jan 2024 10:30:35 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

We discuss recent progress for entanglement filtering, loop optimization, bond-weighting techniques and matrix product decompositions for Grassmann tensor networks. The new methods are tested with two-dimensional Wilson--Majorana fermions and multi-flavor Gross--Neveu models. We show that the methods can also be applied to the fermionic Hubbard model in 1+1 and 2+1 dimensions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08542'&gt;arXiv:2401.08542&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 16 Jan 2024 18:06:23 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Floquet Flux Attachment in Cold Atomic Systems</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08754</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Helia Kamal, Jack Kemp, Yin-Chen He, Yohei Fuji, Monika Aidelsburger, Peter Zoller, Norman Y. Yao&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Flux attachment provides a powerful conceptual framework for understanding certain forms of topological order, including most notably the fractional quantum Hall effect. Despite its ubiquitous use as a theoretical tool, directly realizing flux attachment in a microscopic setting remains an open challenge. Here, we propose a simple approach to realizing flux attachment in a periodically-driven (Floquet) system of either spins or hard-core bosons. We demonstrate that such a system naturally realizes correlated hopping interactions and provides a sharp connection between such interactions and flux attachment. Starting with a simple, nearest-neighbor, free boson model, we find evidence -- from both a coupled wire analysis and large-scale density matrix renormalization group simulations -- that Floquet flux attachment stabilizes the bosonic integer quantum Hall state at $1/4$ filling (on a square lattice), and the Halperin-221 fractional quantum Hall state at $1/6$ filling (on a honeycomb lattice). At $1/2$ filling on the square lattice, time-reversal symmetry is instead spontaneously broken and bosonic integer quantum Hall states with opposite Hall conductances are degenerate. Finally, we propose an optical-lattice-based implementation of our model on a square lattice and discuss prospects for adiabatic preparation as well as effects of Floquet heating.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08754'&gt;arXiv:2401.08754&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 16 Jan 2024 19:00:01 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Luttinger Liquid phase in the Aubry-André Hubbard chain</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Runze Chi, Josephine J. Yu, Chaitanya Murthy, T. Xiang&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We study the interplay between an on-site Hubbard repulsion and quasiperiodic potential in one-dimensional fermion chains using the density matrix renormalization group. We find that, at half-filling, the quasiperiodic potential can destroy the Mott gap, leading to a metallic Luttinger liquid phase between the gapped Mott insulator at strong repulsion and localized gapless Aubry- André insulator at strong quasiperiodic potential. Away from half-filing, the metallic phase of the interacting model persists to larger critical strengths of the potential than in the non-interacting case, suggesting interaction-stabilized delocalization at finite doping. We characterize the Luttinger liquid through its charge and spin correlations, structure factors, and entanglement entropy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08980'&gt;arXiv:2401.08980&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 17 Jan 2024 05:18:51 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

By inserting the "temporal" scaling of the AdS metric by hand via the bulk Hamiltonian interaction strength, we recover a toy model with consistent causality structure. This leads to an interesting implication between two topics in quantum information: if position-based verification is secure against attacks with small entanglement then there are new fundamental lower bounds for resources required for one Hamiltonian to simulate another.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09058'&gt;arXiv:2401.09058&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 17 Jan 2024 08:48:15 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Quantum Computer Simulation Software Packages: State Vector Simulators</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Amit Jamadagni, Andreas M. Läuchli, Cornelius Hempel&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Rapid advances in quantum computing technology lead to an increasing need for software simulators that enable both algorithm design and the validation of results obtained from quantum hardware. This includes calculations that aim at probing regimes of quantum advantage, where a quantum computer outperforms a classical computer in the same task. High performance computing (HPC) platforms play a crucial role as today's quantum devices already reach beyond the limits of what powerful workstations can model, but a systematic evaluation of the individual performance of the many offered simulation packages is lacking so far. In this Technical Review, we benchmark several software packages capable of simulating quantum dynamics with a special focus on HPC capabilities. We develop a containerized toolchain for benchmarking a large set of simulation packages on a local HPC cluster using different parallelisation capabilities, and compare the performance and system size-scaling for three paradigmatic quantum computing tasks. Our results can help finding the right package for a given simulation task and lay the foundation for a systematic community effort to benchmark and validate upcoming versions of existing and also newly developed simulation packages.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09076'&gt;arXiv:2401.09076&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 17 Jan 2024 09:34:28 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Yintai Zhang, Jacek Dziarmaga&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; A bang-bang (BB) algorithm prepares the ground state of a two-dimensional (2D) quantum many-body Hamiltonian $H=H_1+H_2$ by evolving an initial product state alternating between $H_1$ and $H_2$. We use the neighborhood tensor update to simulate the BB evolution with an infinite pair-entangled projected state (iPEPS). The alternating sequence is optimized with the final energy as a cost function. The energy is calculated with the tangent space methods for the sake of their stability. The method is benchmarked in the 2D transverse field quantum Ising model near its quantum critical point against a ground state obtained by variational optimization of the iPEPS. The optimal BB sequence differs non-perturbatively from a sequence simulating quantum annealing or adiabatic preparation (AP) of the ground state. The optimal BB energy converges with the number of bangs much faster than the optimal AP energy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09158'&gt;arXiv:2401.09158&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 17 Jan 2024 12:04:10 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Where is the spin liquid in maple-leaf quantum magnet?</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Pratyay Ghosh&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We investigate the possibility of exotic phenomena, viz. quantum spin liquid (QSL) or deconfined quantum critical point (DQCP), in the spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ Heisenberg model on the maple-leaf lattice, a geometrically frustrated system formed by hexagons (coupling $J_h$), triangles (coupling $J_t$), and dimers (coupling $J_d$). We identify one promising region, given by $J_h &gt; 0$ and $J_t, J_d &lt; 0$, for hosting enticing physics. In this region, the quantum phase diagram of the system exhibits an interplay between Néel order and a gapped dimerized singlet phase. This arrangement holds the possibility of harboring a QSL and a DQCP. Using bond-operator mean-field theory and density matrix renormalization group calculations, we delve into this uncharted territory, revealing tantalizing evidence of the existence of a QSL phase and highlighting its potential as a platform for DQCP.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09422'&gt;arXiv:2401.09422&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 17 Jan 2024 18:59:51 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Universal contributions to charge fluctuations in spin chains at finite temperature</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09548</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Kang-Le Cai, Meng Cheng&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; At finite temperature, conserved charges undergo thermal fluctuations in a quantum many-body system in the grand canonical ensemble. The full structure of the fluctuations of the total U(1) charge $Q$ can be succinctly captured by the generating function $G(\theta)=\left\langle e^{i \theta Q}\right\rangle$. For a 1D translation-invariant spin chain, in the thermodynamic limit the magnitude $|G(\theta)|$ scales with the system size $L$ as $\ln |G(\theta)|=-\alpha(\theta)L+\gamma(\theta)$, where $\gamma(\theta)$ is the scale-invariant contribution and may encode universal information about the underlying system. In this work we investigate the behavior and physical meaning of $\gamma(\theta)$ when the system is periodic. We find that $\gamma(\theta)$ only takes nonzero values at isolated points of $\theta$, which is $\theta=\pi$ for all our examples. In two exemplary lattice systems we show that $\gamma(\pi)$ takes quantized values when the U(1) symmetry exhibits a specific type of 't Hooft anomaly with other symmetries. In other cases, we investigate how $\gamma(\theta)$ depends on microscopic conditions (such as the filling factor) in field theory and exactly solvable lattice models.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09548'&gt;arXiv:2401.09548&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 17 Jan 2024 19:05:07 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Optimal sampling of tensor networks targeting wave function's fast decaying tails</title>

Our method generates samples based on an exact cumulative bounding function, without prior knowledge, in the minimal amount of tensor network contractions. The algorithm avoids sample repetition and, thus, is efficient at sampling distribution with exponentially decaying tails. We illustrate the computational advantage provided by our optimal sampling method through various numerical examples, involving condensed matter, optimization problems, and quantum circuit scenarios. Theory predicts up to an exponential speedup reducing the scaling for sampling the space up to an accumulated unknown probability $\epsilon$ from $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-1})$ to $\mathcal{O}(\log(\epsilon^{-1}))$ for a decaying probability distribution. We confirm this in practice with over one order of magnitude speedup or multiple orders improvement in the error depending on the application. Our sampling strategy extends beyond local observables, e.g., to quantum magic.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10330'&gt;arXiv:2401.10330&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 18 Jan 2024 19:00:05 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Fast gradient-free activation maximization for neurons in spiking neural networks</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10748</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Nikita Pospelov, Andrei Chertkov, Maxim Beketov, Ivan Oseledets, Konstantin Anokhin&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Elements of neural networks, both biological and artificial, can be described by their selectivity for specific cognitive features. Understanding these features is important for understanding the inner workings of neural networks. For a living system, such as a neuron, whose response to a stimulus is unknown and not differentiable, the only way to reveal these features is through a feedback loop that exposes it to a large set of different stimuli. The properties of these stimuli should be varied iteratively in order to maximize the neuronal response. To utilize this feedback loop for a biological neural network, it is important to run it quickly and efficiently in order to reach the stimuli that maximizes certain neurons' activation with the least number of iterations possible. Here we present a framework with an efficient design for such a loop. We successfully tested it on an artificial spiking neural network (SNN), which is a model that simulates the asynchronous spiking activity of neurons in living brains. Our optimization method for activation maximization is based on the low-rank Tensor Train decomposition of the discrete activation function. The optimization space is the latent parameter space of images generated by SN-GAN or VQ-VAE generative models. To our knowledge, this is the first time that effective AM has been applied to SNNs. We track changes in the optimal stimuli for artificial neurons during training and show that highly selective neurons can form already in the early epochs of training and in the early layers of a convolutional spiking network. This formation of refined optimal stimuli is associated with an increase in classification accuracy. Some neurons, especially in the deeper layers, may gradually change the concepts they are selective for during learning, potentially explaining their importance for model performance.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10748'&gt;arXiv:2401.10748&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 28 Dec 2023 18:30:13 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Quantum Circuit Simulation with Fast Tensor Decision Diagram</title>

The predominant approaches in this area center on tensor networks, prized for their better concurrency and less computation than methods using full quantum vectors and matrices. However, even with the advantages, array-based tensors can have significant redundancy. We present a novel open-source framework that harnesses tensor decision diagrams to eliminate overheads and achieve significant speedups over prior approaches. On average, it delivers a speedup of 37$\times$ over Google's TensorNetwork library on redundancy-rich circuits, and 25$\times$ and 144$\times$ over quantum multi-valued decision diagram and prior tensor decision diagram implementation, respectively, on Google random quantum circuits. To achieve this, we introduce a new linear-complexity rank simplification algorithm, Tetris, and edge-centric data structures for recursive tensor decision diagram operations. Additionally, we explore the efficacy of tensor network contraction ordering and optimizations from binary decision diagrams.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11362'&gt;arXiv:2401.11362&lt;/a&gt;] Published Sun, 21 Jan 2024 01:24:29 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Gapless symmetry-protected topological phases and generalized deconfined critical points from gauging a finite subgroup</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11702</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Lei Su, Meng Zeng&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Gauging a finite subgroup of a global symmetry can map conventional phases and phase transitions to unconventional ones. In this work, we study, as a concrete example, an emergent $\mathbb{Z}_2$-gauged system with global symmetry $U(1)$, namely, the $\mathbb{Z}_2$-gauged Bose-Hubbard model both in 1-D and in 2-D. In certain limits, there is an emergent mixed 't Hooft anomaly between the quotient $\tilde{U}(1)$ symmetry and the dual $\hat{\mathbb{Z}}_2$ symmetry. In 1-D, the superfluid phase is mapped to an intrinsically gapless symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phase, as supported by density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) calculations. In 2-D, the original superfluid-insulator transition becomes a generalized deconfined quantum critical point (DQCP) between a gapless SPT phase, where a SPT order coexists with Goldstone modes, and a $\tilde{U}(1)$-symmetry-enriched topological (SET) phase. We also discuss the stability of these phases and the critical points to small perturbations and their potential experimental realizations. Our work demonstrates that partial gauging is a simple and yet powerful approach in constructing novel phases and quantum criticalities.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11702'&gt;arXiv:2401.11702&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 22 Jan 2024 05:46:49 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; John D. Mayfield, Issam El Naqa&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Introduction Quantum Convolutional Neural Network (QCNN)-Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models were studied to provide sequential relationships for each timepoint in MRIs of patients with Multiple Sclerosis (MS). In this pilot study, we compared three QCNN-LSTM models for binary classification of MS disability benchmarked against classical neural network architectures. Our hypothesis is that quantum models will provide competitive performance. Methods Matrix Product State (MPS), reverse Multistate Entanglement Renormalization Ansatz (MERA), and Tree-Tensor Network (TTN) circuits were paired with LSTM layer to process near-annual MRI data of patients diagnosed with MS. These were benchmarked against a Visual Geometry Group (VGG)-LSTM and a Video Vision Transformer (ViViT). Predicted logits were measured against ground truth labels of each patient's Extended Disability Severity Score (EDSS) using binary cross-entropy loss. Training/validation/holdout testing was partitioned using 5-fold cross validation with a total split of 60:20:20. Levene's test of variance was used to measure statistical difference and Student's t-test for paired model differences in mean. Results The MPS-LSTM, reverse MERA-LSTM, and TTN-LSTM had holdout testing ROC-AUC of 0.70, 0.77, and 0.81, respectively (p-value 0.915). VGG16-LSTM and ViViT performed similarly with ROC-AUC of 0.73 and 0.77, respectively (p-value 0.631). Overall variance and mean were not statistically significant (p-value 0.713), however, time to train was significantly faster for the QCNN-LSTMs (39.4 sec per fold vs. 224 and 218, respectively, p-value &lt;0.001). Conclusion QCNN-LSTM models perform competitively to their classical counterparts with greater efficiency in train time. Clinically, these can add value in terms of efficiency to time-dependent deep learning prediction of disease progression based upon medical imaging.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12132'&gt;arXiv:2401.12132&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 22 Jan 2024 17:14:47 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Non-invertible symmetries and LSM-type constraints on a tensor product Hilbert space</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12281</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Nathan Seiberg, Sahand Seifnashri, Shu-Heng Shao&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We discuss the exact non-invertible Kramers-Wannier symmetry of 1+1d lattice models on a tensor product Hilbert space of qubits. This symmetry is associated with a topological defect and a conserved operator, and the latter can be presented as a matrix product operator. Importantly, unlike its continuum counterpart, the symmetry algebra involves lattice translations. Consequently, it is not described by a fusion category. In the presence of this defect, the symmetry algebra involving parity/time-reversal is realized projectively, which is reminiscent of an anomaly. Different Hamiltonians with the same lattice non-invertible symmetry can flow in their continuum limits to infinitely many different fusion categories (with different Frobenius-Schur indicators), including, as a special case, the Ising CFT. The non-invertible symmetry leads to a constraint similar to that of Lieb-Schultz-Mattis, implying that the system cannot have a unique gapped ground state. It is either in a gapless phase or in a gapped phase with three (or a multiple of three) ground states, associated with the spontaneous breaking of the lattice non-invertible symmetry.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12281'&gt;arXiv:2401.12281&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 22 Jan 2024 19:00:00 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Strong zero modes in integrable quantum circuits</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12305</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Eric Vernier, Hsiu-Chung Yeh, Lorenzo Piroli, Aditi Mitra&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; It is a classic result that certain interacting integrable spin chains host robust edge modes known as strong zero modes (SZMs). In this work, we extend this result to the Floquet setting of local quantum circuits, focusing on a prototypical model providing an integrable Trotterization for the evolution of the XXZ Heisenberg spin chain. By exploiting the algebraic structures of integrability, we show that an exact SZM operator can be constructed for these integrable quantum circuits in certain regions of parameter space. Our construction, which recovers a well-known result by Paul Fendley in the continuous-time limit, relies on a set of commuting transfer matrices known from integrability, and allows us to easily prove important properties of the SZM, including normalizabilty. Our approach is different from previous methods and could be of independent interest even in the Hamiltonian setting. Our predictions, which are corroborated by numerical simulations of infinite-temperature autocorrelation functions, are potentially interesting for implementations of the XXZ quantum circuit on available quantum platforms.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12305'&gt;arXiv:2401.12305&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 22 Jan 2024 19:02:33 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Efficient near-optimal decoding of the surface code through ensembling</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12434</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Noah Shutty, Michael Newman, Benjamin Villalonga&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We introduce harmonization, an ensembling method that combines several "noisy" decoders to generate highly accurate decoding predictions. Harmonized ensembles of MWPM-based decoders achieve lower logical error rates than their individual counterparts on repetition and surface code benchmarks, approaching maximum-likelihood accuracy at large ensemble sizes. We can use the degree of consensus among the ensemble as a confidence measure for a layered decoding scheme, in which a small ensemble flags high-risk cases to be checked by a larger, more accurate ensemble. This layered scheme can realize the accuracy improvements of large ensembles with a relatively small constant factor of computational overhead. We conclude that harmonization provides a viable path towards highly accurate real-time decoding.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12434'&gt;arXiv:2401.12434&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 23 Jan 2024 02:01:33 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Tensor network influence functionals in the continuous-time limit: connections to quantum embedding, bath discretization, and higher-order time propagation</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12460</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Gunhee Park, Nathan Ng, David R. Reichman, Garnet Kin-Lic Chan&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We describe two developments of tensor network influence functionals (in particular, influence functional matrix product states (IF-MPS)) for quantum impurity dynamics within the fermionic setting of the Anderson impurity model. The first provides the correct extension of the IF-MPS to continuous time by introducing a related mathematical object, the boundary influence functional MPS. The second connects the dynamics described by a compressed IF-MPS to that of a quantum embedding method with a time-dependent effective bath undergoing nonunitary dynamics. Using these concepts, we implement higher-order time propagators for the quench dynamics of the Anderson impurity model within the boundary IF-MPS formalism. The calculations illustrate the ability of the current formulation to efficiently remove the time step error in standard discrete-time IF-MPS implementations as well as to interface with state vector propagation techniques. They also show the advantages of IF-MPS dynamics, with its associated highly compact effective bath dynamics, over state vector propagation with a static bath discretization.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12460'&gt;arXiv:2401.12460&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 23 Jan 2024 03:01:04 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Keldysh crossover in one-dimensional Mott insulators</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12584</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Kazuya Shinjo, Takami Tohyama&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Recent advancements in pulse laser technology have facilitated the exploration of non-equilibrium spectroscopy of electronic states in the presence of strong electric fields across a broad range of photon energies. The Keldysh crossover serves as an indicator that distinguishes between excitations resulting from photon absorption triggered by near-infrared multicycle pulses and those arising from quantum tunneling induced by terahertz pulses. Using time-dependent density-matrix renormalization group, we investigate the emergence of the Keldysh crossover in a one-dimensional (1D) Mott insulator. We find that the Drude weight is proportional to photo-doped doublon density when a pump pulse induces photon absorption. In contrast, the Drude weight is suppressed when a terahertz pulse introduces doublons and holons via quantum tunneling. The suppressed Drude weight accompanies glassy dynamics with suppressed diffusion, which is a consequence of strong correlations and exhibits finite polarization decaying slowly after pulse irradiation. In the quantum tunneling region, entanglement entropy slowly grows logarithmically. These contrasting behaviors between the photon-absorption and quantum tunneling regions are a manifestation of the Keldysh crossover in 1D Mott insulators and provide a novel methodology for designing the localization and symmetry of electronic states called subcycle-pulse engineering.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12584'&gt;arXiv:2401.12584&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 23 Jan 2024 09:29:13 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Chern numbers in two-dimensional systems with spiral boundary conditions</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Masaaki Nakamura, Shohei Masuda&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We discuss methods for calculating Chern numbers of two-dimensional lattice systems using spiral boundary conditions, which sweep all lattice sites in one-dimensional order. Specifically, we establish the one-dimensional representation of Fukui-Hatsugai-Suzuki's method, based on lattice gauge theory, and the Coh-Vanderbilt's method, which relates to electronic polarization. The essential point of this discussion is that the insertion of flux into the extended one-dimensional chain generates an effective current in the perpendicular direction. These methods are valuable not only for a unified understanding of topological physics in different dimensions but also for numerical calculations, including the density matrix renormalization group.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12674'&gt;arXiv:2401.12674&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 23 Jan 2024 11:32:21 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Tensor train based sampling algorithms for approximating regularized Wasserstein proximal operators</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13125</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Fuqun Han, Stanley Osher, Wuchen Li&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We present a tensor train (TT) based algorithm designed for sampling from a target distribution and employ TT approximation to capture the high-dimensional probability density evolution of overdamped Langevin dynamics. This involves utilizing the regularized Wasserstein proximal operator, which exhibits a simple kernel integration formulation, i.e., the softmax formula of the traditional proximal operator. The integration, performed in $\mathbb{R}^d$, poses a challenge in practical scenarios, making the algorithm practically implementable only with the aid of TT approximation. In the specific context of Gaussian distributions, we rigorously establish the unbiasedness and linear convergence of our sampling algorithm towards the target distribution. To assess the effectiveness of our proposed methods, we apply them to various scenarios, including Gaussian families, Gaussian mixtures, bimodal distributions, and Bayesian inverse problems in numerical examples. The sampling algorithm exhibits superior accuracy and faster convergence when compared to classical Langevin dynamics-type sampling algorithms.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13125'&gt;arXiv:2401.13125&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 23 Jan 2024 22:20:03 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Spin Seebeck Effect as a Probe for Majorana Fermions in Kitaev Spin Liquids</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13175</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Yasuyuki Kato, Joji Nasu, Masahiro Sato, Tsuyoshi Okubo, Takahiro Misawa, Yukitoshi Motome&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Quantum entanglement in strongly correlated electron systems often leads to exotic elementary excitations. Quantum spin liquids (QSLs) provide a paradigmatic example, where the elementary excitations are described by fractional quasiparticles such as spinons. However, such fractional quasiparticles behave differently from electrons, making their experimental identification challenging. Here, we theoretically investigate the spin Seebeck effect, which is a thermoelectric response via a spin current, as an efficient probe of the fractional quasiparticles in QSLs, focusing on the Kitaev honeycomb model. By comprehensive studies using the real-time dynamics, the perturbation theory, and the linear spin-wave theory based on the tunnel spin-current theory, we find that the spin current is induced by thermal gradient in the Kitaev spin liquid, via the low-energy fractional Majorana excitations. This underscores the ability of Majorana fermions to carry spin current, despite lacking spin angular momentum. Furthermore, we find that the induced spin current changes its sign depending on the sign of the Kitaev interaction, indicating that the Majorana fermions contribute to the spin current with (up-)down-spin like nature when the exchange coupling is (anti)ferromagnetic. Thus, in contrast to the negative spin current already found in a one-dimensional QSL, our finding reveals that the spin Seebeck effect can exhibit either positive or negative signals, contingent upon the nature of fractional excitations in the QSLs. We also clarify contrasting field-angle dependence between the Kitaev spin liquid in the low-field limit and the high-field ferromagnetic state, which is useful for the experimental identification. Our finding suggests that the spin Seebeck effect could be used not only to detect fractional quasiparticles emerging in QSLs but also to generate and control them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13175'&gt;arXiv:2401.13175&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 24 Jan 2024 01:43:22 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Emergent Holographic Forces from Tensor Networks and Criticality</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Rahul Sahay, Mikhail D. Lukin, Jordan Cotler&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The AdS/CFT correspondence stipulates a duality between conformal field theories and certain theories of quantum gravity in one higher spatial dimension. However, probing this conjecture on contemporary classical or quantum computers is challenging. We formulate an efficiently implementable multi-scale entanglement renormalization ansatz (MERA) model of AdS/CFT providing a mapping between a (1+1)-dimensional critical spin system and a (2+1)-dimensional bulk theory. Using a combination of numerics and analytics, we show that the bulk theory arising from this optimized tensor network furnishes excitations with attractive interactions. Remarkably, these excitations have one- and two-particle energies matching the predictions for matter coupled to AdS gravity at long distances, thus displaying key features of AdS physics. We show that these potentials arise as a direct consequence of entanglement renormalization and discuss how this approach can be used to efficiently simulate bulk dynamics using realistic quantum devices.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13595'&gt;arXiv:2401.13595&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 24 Jan 2024 17:03:03 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

It establishes a power law connection between non-equilibrium defects quenched through a continuous phase transition and the quench rate via the scaling exponent. We present a novel numerical scheme to estimate the scaling exponent wherein the notion of defects is mapped to errors, previously introduced to quantify a variety of gapped quantum phases. To demonstrate the versatility of our method we conduct numerical experiments across a broad spectrum of spin-half models hosting local and symmetry protected topological order. Furthermore, an implementation of the quench dynamics featuring a topological phase transition on a digital quantum computer is proposed to quantify the associated criticality.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13625'&gt;arXiv:2401.13625&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 24 Jan 2024 17:57:27 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Entanglement growth from squeezing on the MPS manifold</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13740</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Sebastian Leontica, Andrew G. Green&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Finding suitable characterizations of quantum chaos is a major challenge in many-body physics, with a central difficulty posed by the linearity of the Schrödinger equation. A possible solution for recovering non-linearity is to project the dynamics onto some variational manifold. The classical chaos induced via this procedure may be used as a signature of quantum chaos in the full Hilbert space. Here, we demonstrate analytically a previously heuristic connection between the Lyapunov spectrum from projection onto the matrix product state (MPS) manifold and the growth of entanglement. This growth occurs by squeezing a localized distribution on the variational manifold. The process qualitatively resembles the Cardy-Calabrese picture, where local perturbations to a moving MPS reference are interpreted as bosonic quasi-particles. Taking careful account of the number of distinct channels for these processes recovers the connection to the Lyapunov spectrum. Our results rigorously establish the physical significance of the projected Lyapunov spectrum, suggesting it as an alternative method of characterizing chaos in quantum many-body systems, one that is manifestly linked to classical chaos.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13740'&gt;arXiv:2401.13740&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 24 Jan 2024 19:00:04 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

In particular, we define a model corresponding to a $\operatorname{Tube}(\mathcal{C})$ symmetry protected topological phase, and we provide a gauging procedure which results in the corresponding Levin-Wen model. In the case $\mathcal{C}=\mathsf{Hilb}(G,\omega)$, we show how our procedure reduces to the twisted gauging of a trivial $G$-SPT to produce the Twisted Quantum Double. We further provide an example which is outside the bounds of the current literature, the trivial Fibonacci SPT, whose gauge theory results in the doubled Fibonacci string-net. Our formalism has a natural topological interpretation with string diagrams living on a punctured sphere. We provide diagrams to supplement our mathematical proofs and to give the reader an intuitive understanding of the subject matter.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13838'&gt;arXiv:2401.13838&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 24 Jan 2024 22:29:45 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

We use the random matrix formulation of the Loschmidt echo for a set of spin chains, and randomize the ferromagnetic spin interaction. It is shown that the thermal Loschmidt echo, when averaged, detects the predicted increase in entropy across the Hawking-Page transition. This suggests that a 1d spin chain exhibits characteristics of black hole physics in 4+1 dimensions. We show that this approach is equally applicable to free fermion systems with a general dispersion relation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13963'&gt;arXiv:2401.13963&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 25 Jan 2024 05:51:33 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

Jahromi, Abhijoy Sarkar, Uygar Kurt, Sukhbinder Singh, Faysal Ishtiaq, Cesar Muñoz, Prabdeep Singh Bajaj, Ali Elborady, Gianni del Bimbo, Mehrazin Alizadeh, David Montero, Pablo Martin-Ramiro, Muhammad Ibrahim, Oussama Tahiri Alaoui, John Malcolm, Samuel Mugel, Roman Orus&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT and LlaMA are advancing rapidly in generative Artificial Intelligence (AI), but their immense size poses significant challenges, such as huge training and inference costs, substantial energy demands, and limitations for on-site deployment. Traditional compression methods such as pruning, distillation, and low-rank approximation focus on reducing the effective number of neurons in the network, while quantization focuses on reducing the numerical precision of individual weights to reduce the model size while keeping the number of neurons fixed. While these compression methods have been relatively successful in practice, there is no compelling reason to believe that truncating the number of neurons is an optimal strategy. In this context, this paper introduces CompactifAI, an innovative LLM compression approach using quantum-inspired Tensor Networks that focuses on the model's correlation space instead, allowing for a more controlled, refined and interpretable model compression. Our method is versatile and can be implemented with - or on top of - other compression techniques. As a benchmark, we demonstrate that a combination of CompactifAI with quantization allows to reduce a 93% the memory size of LlaMA 7B, reducing also 70% the number of parameters, accelerating 50% the training and 25% the inference times of the model, and just with a small accuracy drop of 2% - 3%, going much beyond of what is achievable today by other compression techniques. Our methods also allow to perform a refined layer sensitivity profiling, showing that deeper layers tend to be more suitable for tensor network compression, which is compatible with recent observations on the ineffectiveness of those layers for LLM performance. Our results imply that standard LLMs are, in fact, heavily overparametrized, and do not need to be large at all.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14109'&gt;arXiv:2401.14109&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 25 Jan 2024 11:45:21 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Variational Neural and Tensor Network Approximations of Thermal States</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Sirui Lu, Giacomo Giudice, J. Ignacio Cirac&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We introduce a variational Monte Carlo algorithm for approximating finite-temperature quantum many-body systems, based on the minimization of a modified free energy. This approach directly approximates the state at a fixed temperature, allowing for systematic improvement of the ansatz expressiveness without accumulating errors from iterative imaginary time evolution. We employ a variety of trial states -- both tensor networks as well as neural networks -- as variational Ansätze for our numerical optimization. We benchmark and compare different constructions in the above classes, both for one- and two-dimensional problems, with systems made of up to $N=100$ spins. Our results demonstrate that while restricted Boltzmann machines show limitations, string bond tensor network states exhibit systematic improvements with increasing bond dimensions and the number of strings.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14243'&gt;arXiv:2401.14243&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 25 Jan 2024 15:36:45 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

Bondar&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We present an expression for the spectral gap, opening up new possibilities for performing and accelerating spectral calculations of quantum many-body systems. We develop and demonstrate one such possibility in the context of tensor network simulations. Our approach requires only minor modifications of the widely used simple update method and is computationally lightweight relative to other approaches. We validate it by computing spectral gaps of the 2D and 3D transverse-field Ising models and find strong agreement with previously reported perturbation theory results.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14368'&gt;arXiv:2401.14368&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 25 Jan 2024 18:16:40 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Christophe Chatelain&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The critical behavior of a dimer model with an interaction favoring parallel dimers in each plaquette of the square lattice is studied numerically by means of the Corner Transfer Matrix Renormalization Group algorithm. The critical exponents are known to depend on the chemical potential of vacancies, or monomers. At large average density of the latter, the phase transition becomes of first-order. We compute the scaling dimensions of both order parameter and temperature in the second order regime and compare them with the conjecture that the critical behavior is the same as the Ashkin-Teller model on its self-dual critical line.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14830'&gt;arXiv:2401.14830&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 26 Jan 2024 12:57:45 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

A redundancy in saved spaces of the reduced density matrix is exploited to reduce a condition number resulting from the non-unitarity of the left and right transformation matrices, in order to ensure the numerical stability of the RG procedure. The algorithm is successfully applied to an interacting fermionic Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model with nonreciprocal hoppings and staggered complex chemical potential, exhibiting novel many-body phenomena.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15000'&gt;arXiv:2401.15000&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 26 Jan 2024 17:00:04 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Tensor product algorithms for inference of contact network from epidemiological data</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15031</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Sergey Dolgov, Dmitry Savostyanov&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We consider a problem of inferring contact network from nodal states observed during an epidemiological process. In a black--box Bayesian optimisation framework this problem reduces to a discrete likelihood optimisation over the set of possible networks. The cardinality of this set grows combinatorially with the number of network nodes, which makes this optimisation computationally challenging. For each network, its likelihood is the probability for the observed data to appear during the evolution of the epidemiological process on this network. This probability can be very small, particularly if the network is significantly different from the ground truth network, from which the observed data actually appear. A commonly used stochastic simulation algorithm struggles to recover rare events and hence to estimate small probabilities and likelihoods. In this paper we replace the stochastic simulation with solving the chemical master equation for the probabilities of all network states. Since this equation also suffers from the curse of dimensionality, we apply tensor train approximations to overcome it and enable fast and accurate computations. Numerical simulations demonstrate efficient black--box Bayesian inference of the network.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15031'&gt;arXiv:2401.15031&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 26 Jan 2024 17:44:53 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

Lin&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We investigate quantum phase transitions in various spin chain systems using the multipartite entanglement measure $\tau_{SEF}$ based on the monogamy inequality of squared entanglement of formation. Our results demonstrate that $\tau_{SEF}$ is more effective and reliable than bipartite entanglement or bipartite correlation measures such as entanglement of formation, von Neumann entropy, and quantum discord in characterizing quantum phase transitions. $\tau_{SEF}$ not only detects critical points that may go unnoticed by other detectors but also avoids the issue of singularity at non-critical points encountered by other measures. Furthermore, by applying $\tau_{SEF}$, we have obtained the phase diagram for the XY spin chain with three and four interactions and discovered a new quantum phase.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15593'&gt;arXiv:2401.15593&lt;/a&gt;] Published Sun, 28 Jan 2024 07:26:14 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

In this paper, we apply the algorithm to the Rainbow-chain model, which has a product state of singlet pairs between spins separated by various distances as an approximate ground state. We then demonstrate that the algorithm can successfully visualize the spatial pattern of spin-singlet pairs in the ground state.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16000'&gt;arXiv:2401.16000&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 29 Jan 2024 09:39:24 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Solving intractable chemical problems by tensor decomposition</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Nina Glaser, Markus Reiher&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Many complex chemical problems encoded in terms of physics-based models become computationally intractable for traditional numerical approaches due to their unfavourable scaling with increasing molecular size. Tensor decomposition techniques can overcome such challenges by decomposing unattainably large numerical representations of chemical problems into smaller, tractable ones. In the first two decades of this century, algorithms based on such tensor factorizations have become state-of-the-art methods in various branches of computational chemistry, ranging from molecular quantum dynamics to electronic structure theory and machine learning. Here, we consider the role that tensor decomposition schemes have played in expanding the scope of computational chemistry. We relate some of the most prominent methods to their common underlying tensor network formalism, providing a unified perspective on leading tensor-based approaches in chemistry and materials science.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16246'&gt;arXiv:2401.16246&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 29 Jan 2024 15:49:28 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>TQCompressor: improving tensor decomposition methods in neural networks via permutations</title>

Perelshtein&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We introduce TQCompressor, a novel method for neural network model compression with improved tensor decompositions. We explore the challenges posed by the computational and storage demands of pre-trained language models in NLP tasks and propose a permutation-based enhancement to Kronecker decomposition. This enhancement makes it possible to reduce loss in model expressivity which is usually associated with factorization. We demonstrate this method applied to the GPT-2$_{small}$. The result of the compression is TQCompressedGPT-2 model, featuring 81 mln. parameters compared to 124 mln. in the GPT-2$_{small}$. We make TQCompressedGPT-2 publicly available. We further enhance the performance of the TQCompressedGPT-2 through a training strategy involving multi-step knowledge distillation, using only a 3.1% of the OpenWebText. TQCompressedGPT-2 surpasses DistilGPT-2 and KnGPT-2 in comparative evaluations, marking an advancement in the efficient and effective deployment of models in resource-constrained environments.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16367'&gt;arXiv:2401.16367&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 29 Jan 2024 18:07:56 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Learning the stabilizer group of a Matrix Product State</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Guglielmo Lami, Mario Collura&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We present a novel classical algorithm designed to learn the stabilizer group -- namely the group of Pauli strings for which a state is a $\pm 1$ eigenvector -- of a given Matrix Product State (MPS). The algorithm is based on a clever and theoretically grounded biased sampling in the Pauli (or Bell) basis. Its output is a set of independent stabilizer generators whose total number is directly associated with the stabilizer nullity, notably a well-established nonstabilizer monotone. We benchmark our method on $T$-doped states randomly scrambled via Clifford unitary dynamics, demonstrating very accurate estimates up to highly-entangled MPS with bond dimension $\chi\sim 10^3$. Our method, thanks to a very favourable scaling $\mathcal{O}(\chi^3)$, represents the first effective approach to obtain a genuine magic monotone for MPS, enabling systematic investigations of quantum many-body physics out-of-equilibrium.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16481'&gt;arXiv:2401.16481&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 29 Jan 2024 19:00:13 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Nonstabilizerness via matrix product states in the Pauli basis</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16498</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Poetri Sonya Tarabunga, Emanuele Tirrito, Mari Carmen Bañuls, Marcello Dalmonte&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Nonstabilizerness, also known as ``magic'', stands as a crucial resource for achieving a potential advantage in quantum computing. Its connection to many-body physical phenomena is poorly understood at present, mostly due to a lack of practical methods to compute it at large scales. We present a novel approach for the evaluation of nonstabilizerness within the framework of matrix product states (MPS), based on expressing the MPS directly in the Pauli basis. Our framework provides a powerful tool for efficiently calculating various measures of nonstabilizerness, including stabilizer Rényi entropies, stabilizer nullity, and Bell magic, and enables the learning of the stabilizer group of an MPS. We showcase the efficacy and versatility of our method in the ground states of Ising and XXZ spin chains, as well as in circuits dynamics that has recently been realized in Rydberg atom arrays, where we provide concrete benchmarks for future experiments on logical qubits up to twice the sizes already realized.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16498'&gt;arXiv:2401.16498&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 29 Jan 2024 19:12:10 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Coseparable Nonnegative Tensor Factorization With T-CUR Decomposition</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16836</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Juefei Chen, Longxiu Huang, Yimin Wei&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF) is an important unsupervised learning method to extract meaningful features from data. To address the NMF problem within a polynomial time framework, researchers have introduced a separability assumption, which has recently evolved into the concept of coseparability. This advancement offers a more efficient core representation for the original data. However, in the real world, the data is more natural to be represented as a multi-dimensional array, such as images or videos. The NMF's application to high-dimensional data involves vectorization, which risks losing essential multi-dimensional correlations. To retain these inherent correlations in the data, we turn to tensors (multidimensional arrays) and leverage the tensor t-product. This approach extends the coseparable NMF to the tensor setting, creating what we term coseparable Nonnegative Tensor Factorization (NTF). In this work, we provide an alternating index selection method to select the coseparable core. Furthermore, we validate the t-CUR sampling theory and integrate it with the tensor Discrete Empirical Interpolation Method (t-DEIM) to introduce an alternative, randomized index selection process. These methods have been tested on both synthetic and facial analysis datasets. The results demonstrate the efficiency of coseparable NTF when compared to coseparable NMF.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16836'&gt;arXiv:2401.16836&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 30 Jan 2024 09:22:37 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer interaction as an infinite-range Penson-Kolb pairing mechanism</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16877</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Francesco Romeo, Alfonso Maiellaro&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We demonstrate that the well-known $(k\uparrow, -k\downarrow)$ Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer interaction, when considered in real space, is equivalent to an infinite-range Penson-Kolb pairing mechanism coexisting with an attractive Hubbard term. Driven by this discovery and aiming at exploring the conduction properties, we investigate the dynamics of fermionic particles confined in a ring-shaped lattice. We assume that fermions are simultaneously influenced by the pairing interaction and by an Aharonov-Bohm electromagnetic phase, which is incorporated into the model in a highly non-trivial manner. Remarkably, the aforementioned model shows Richardson integrability for both integer and half-integer values of the applied magnetic flux $\Phi/\Phi_0$, thus permitting the exact solution of a genuine many-body problem. We discuss the ground state properties of both two-particle and many-particle systems, drawing comparisons with results from the attractive Hubbard model. Our approach combines exact diagonalization, density matrix renormalization group techniques, and numerical solution of the Richardson equations. This comprehensive analysis allows us to study various key metrics, including the system's conductivity as a function of the interaction strength. In this way, the BCS-BEC transition is investigated in a continuous manner, thus permitting to shed light on fundamental aspects of superconducting pairing. Our findings can be experimentally tested in a condensed matter context or, with greater level of control, using atomtronics platforms.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16877'&gt;arXiv:2401.16877&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 30 Jan 2024 10:29:46 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Detecting Measurement-Induced Entanglement Transitions With Unitary Mirror Circuits</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17367</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Yariv Yanay, Brian Swingle, Charles Tahan&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Monitored random circuits, consisting of alternating layers of entangling two-qubit gates and projective single-qubit measurements applied to some fraction $p$ of the qubits, have been a topic of recent interest. In particular, the resulting steady state exhibits a phase transition from highly correlated states with "volume-law" entanglement at $p&lt;p_{c}$ to localized states with "area-law" entanglement at $p&gt;p_{c}$. It is hard to access this transition experimentally, as it cannot be seen at the ensemble level. Naively, to observe it one must repeat the experiment until the set of measurement results repeats itself, with likelihood that is exponentially small in the number of measurements. To overcome this issue, we present a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm which creates a matrix product state (MPS) based "unitary mirror" of the projected circuit. Polynomial-sized tensor networks can represent quantum states with area-law entanglement, and so the unitary mirror can well-approximate the experimental state above $p_{c}$ but fails exponentially below it. The breaking of this mirror can thus pinpoint the critical point. We outline the algorithm and how such results would be obtained. We present a bound on the maximum entanglement entropy of any given state that is well-represented by an MPS, and from the bound suggest how the volume-law phase can be bounded. We consider whether the entanglement could similarly be bounded from below where the MPS fails. Finally, we present numerical results for small qubit numbers and for monitored circuits with random Clifford gates.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17367'&gt;arXiv:2401.17367&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 30 Jan 2024 19:00:11 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

This derivation of the on-shell equation is based on two physical assumptions. First, the Lorentzian bulk theory is in the ground state. Second, the law of Lorentzian holographic gravity is identified with the time-energy uncertainty principle. The arguments in this derivation could lead to a novel picture of Lorentzian gravity as a quantum mechanical time uncertainty based on the holographic principle and classicalization.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17458'&gt;arXiv:2401.17458&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 30 Jan 2024 21:41:09 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17466</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Koudai Sugimoto&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We theoretically investigate the single-particle excitation spectra of a one-dimensional Hubbard model at half filling using an infinite matrix-product state and elucidate the discretized energy spectra emerging under the influence of a dc electric field. In a weak electric-field regime, we observe two kinds of spectral structures in the density of states. With increasing the electric-field strength, the discretized spectra, the period of which is proportional to the strength, become dominant, and the density of states exhibits the Wannier-Stark ladder in their spectra. In addition, we also simulate time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy using an ultrashort terahertz pump pulse that approximates a dc electric field. Our results represent a significant step forward in understanding the states in strongly correlated electron systems driven by a static electric field.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17466'&gt;arXiv:2401.17466&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 30 Jan 2024 22:04:17 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Impurity effects in one dimensional spin nematic liquid</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Fumiya Nakamura, Yasuhiro Tada&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We study impurity effects in the spin nematic phase of the $S=1/2$ $J_1$-$J_2$ frustrated spin chain under an external magnetic field by using the infinite density matrix renormalization group and the bosonization. It is found that local magnetization almost saturates around the impurity and the entanglement entropy nearly vanishes at the corresponding bonds, not only when the magnetic interactions near the impurity are weakened but also when they are strengthened compared to those in the bulk. Then, we examine spin correlations and Friedel oscillations induced by the impurity. The bosonization provides a qualitative understanding of the characteristic behaviors of the magnetization. We also discuss impacts of the impurity on experiments by focusing on NMR spectra.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17552'&gt;arXiv:2401.17552&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 31 Jan 2024 02:38:53 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Renormalization group flow and fixed-point in tensor network representations</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.18068</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Atsushi Ueda&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; In this thesis, we present a novel method combining energy-based finite-size scaling with tensor network renormalization (TNR) to study phase transitions in lattice models. This approach effectively calculates running coupling constants and reduces the numerical errors typically associated with TNR, thus requiring fewer renormalization group (RG) steps and less computational resources. Our methodology, contrasting with traditional methods, doesn't depend on large system sizes, making it efficient and robust against simulation scale challenges. We also explore the origins of numerical errors in TNR from a field-theoretical perspective, focusing on how these errors scale with the approximation parameter $D$. This understanding is crucial for error management in simulations. Moreover, we investigate the tensor structure of fixed points in lattice models, addressing challenges from finite bond dimensions using an analytical approach involving conformal mappings. We discover that the tensor elements of fixed-point tensors align with four-point functions of primary operators in conformal field theory (CFT), demonstrating a significant link between CFT and lattice models. This finding underscores the universality of non-trivial infrared physics at the lattice level, bridging theoretical concepts with practical computations in lattice models, and offering deeper insights into the universal aspects of critical phenomena.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.18068'&gt;arXiv:2401.18068&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 31 Jan 2024 18:47:05 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Critical behavior of Fredenhagen-Marcu string order parameters at topological phase transitions with emergent higher-form symmetries</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00127</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Wen-Tao Xu, Frank Pollmann, Michael Knap&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; A nonlocal string order parameter detecting topological order and deconfinement has been proposed by Fredenhagen and Marcu (FM). However, due to the lack of exact internal symmetries for lattice models and the nonlinear dependence of the FM string order parameter on ground states, it is a priori not guaranteed that it is a genuine order parameter for topological phase transitions. In this work, we find that the FM string order parameter exhibits universal scaling behavior near critical points of charge condensation transitions, by directly evaluating the FM string order parameter in the infinite string-length limit using infinite Projected Entangled Pair States (iPEPS) for the toric code in a magnetic field. Our results thus demonstrate that the FM string order parameter represents a quantitatively well-behaved order parameter. We find that only in the presence of an emergent 1-form symmetry the corresponding FM string order parameter can faithfully detect topological transitions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00127'&gt;arXiv:2402.00127&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 31 Jan 2024 19:12:49 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Randomly Monitored Quantum Codes</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00145</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Dongjin Lee, Beni Yoshida&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Quantum measurement has conventionally been regarded as the final step in quantum information processing, which is essential for reading out the processed information but collapses the quantum state into a classical state. However, recent studies have shown that quantum measurement itself can induce novel quantum phenomena. One seminal example is a monitored random circuit, which can generate long-range entanglement faster than a random unitary circuit. Inspired by these results, in this paper, we address the following question: When quantum information is encoded in a quantum error-correcting code, how many physical qubits should be randomly measured to destroy the encoded information? We investigate this question for various quantum error-correcting codes and derive the necessary and sufficient conditions for destroying the information through measurements. In particular, we demonstrate that for a large class of quantum error-correcitng codes, it is impossible to destroy the encoded information through random single-qubit Pauli measurements when a tiny portion of physical qubits is still unmeasured. Our results not only reveal the extraordinary robustness of quantum codes under measurement decoherence, but also suggest potential applications in quantum information processing tasks.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00145'&gt;arXiv:2402.00145&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 31 Jan 2024 19:53:06 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Relation between timelike and spacelike entanglement entropy</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Wu-zhong Guo, Song He, Yu-Xuan Zhang&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; In this study, we establish a connection between timelike and spacelike entanglement entropy. Specifically, for a diverse range of states, the timelike entanglement entropy is uniquely determined by a linear combination of the spacelike entanglement entropy and its first-order temporal derivative. This framework reveals that the imaginary component of the timelike entanglement entropy primarily originates from the non-commutativity between the twist operator and its first-order temporal derivative. Furthermore, we analyze the constraints of this relation and highlight the possible extension to accommodate more complex state configurations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00268'&gt;arXiv:2402.00268&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 01 Feb 2024 01:40:03 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Quantum phase transitions and composite excitations of antiferromagnetic spin trimer chains in a magnetic field</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00272</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Jun-Qing Cheng, Zhi-Yao Ning, Han-Qing Wu, Dao-Xin Yao&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Motivated by recent advancements in theoretical and experimental studies of the high-energy excitations on an antiferromagnetic trimer chain, we numerically investigate the quantum phase transition and composite dynamics in this system by applying a magnetic field. The numerical methods we used include the exact diagonalization, density matrix renormalization group, time-dependent variational principle, and cluster perturbation theory. From calculating the entanglement entropy, we have revealed the phase diagram which includes the XY-I, $1/3$ magnetization plateau, XY-II, and ferromagnetic phases. Both the critical XY-I and XY-II phases are characterized by the conformal field theory with a central charge $c \simeq 1$. By analyzing the dynamic spin structure factor, we elucidate the distinct features of spin dynamics across different phases. In the regime with weak intertrimer interaction, we identify the intermediate-energy and high-energy modes in the XY-I and $1/3$ magnetization plateau phases as internal trimer excitations, corresponding to the propagating of doublons and quartons, respectively. Notably, applying a magnetic field splits the high-energy spectrum into two branches, labeled as the upper quarton and lower quarton. Furthermore, we explore the spin dynamics of a frustrated trimerized model closely related to the quantum magnet \ce{Na_2Cu_3Ge_4O_12}. In the end, we extend our discuss on the possibility of the quarton Bose-Einstein condensation in the trimer systems. Our results are expected to be further verified through the inelastic neutron scattering and resonant inelastic X-ray scattering, and also provide valuable insights for exploring high-energy exotic excitations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00272'&gt;arXiv:2402.00272&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 01 Feb 2024 01:46:01 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

With the numerical matrix product state based infinite density matrix renormalization group method, we discover a robust quantum critical line in the infinite cylinder geometry, where gauge confinement and dimerized translation symmetry breaking emerge simultaneously. We investigate how the transition can be split by a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topologically ordered dimerized phase that is stabilized by additional short-range repulsive interactions. We conjecture a $u(1)$ deconfined criticality scenario, propose a corresponding low-energy effective field theory of the exotic quantum critical point in the two-dimensional limit and identify its shortcomings&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00933'&gt;arXiv:2402.00933&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 01 Feb 2024 19:00:02 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Light-induced phase transitions in vanadium dioxide: a tensor network study</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01247</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Lin Zhang, Utso Bhattacharya, Maria Recasens, Tobias Grass, Ravindra W. Chhajlany, Maciej Lewenstein, Allan S. Johnson&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Nonequilibrium phase transitions driven by light pulses represent a rapidly developing field in condensed matter physics. As one of the archetypal strongly correlated materials, vanadium dioxide (VO2) undergoes a structural phase transition (SPT) from a monoclinic (M1) to rutile (R) structure and an insulator-to-metal transition (IMT) either when heated above 340 K or when excited by an ultrafast laser pulse. Here, we present a tensor network study of the light-induced phase transitions in VO2 based on a quasi-one-dimensional model with all the important ingredients -- multi-orbital character, electron-lattice coupling, and electron-electron correlations -- being included. We show that this model qualitatively captures the equilibrium properties of VO2 by calculating the ground state phase diagram and finite-temperature phase transitions. A hybrid quantum-classical tensor-network method is used to simulate the dynamics following photoexcitation. We find that the structure can transform faster than the harmonic phonon modes of M1 phase, suggesting lattice nonlinearity is key in the SPT. We also find separate timescales for the evolution of dimerization and tilt distortions in the lattice dynamics, as well as the loss and subsequent partial restoration behavior of the displacements, which can provide an explanation for the complex dynamics observed in recent experiments [C. Brahms et al., arXiv:XXXX.XXXXX]. Moreover, decoupled SPT and IMT dynamics are observed in the numerical simulations: while the initial M1 structure transforms to the R one in tens of femtoseconds, the IMT occurs quasi-instantaneously, consistent with recent experimental findings. Our theoretical studies provide insight into the light-induced phase transitions of VO2, revealing unexpected non-monotonic transformation pathways and paving the way for future studies of non-thermal phase transformations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01247'&gt;arXiv:2402.01247&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 02 Feb 2024 09:14:33 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Decoupled few-femtosecond phase transitions in vanadium dioxide</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01266</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Christian Brahms, Lin Zhang, Xiao Shen, Utso Bhattacharya, Maria Recasens, Johann Osmond, Tobias Grass, Ravindra W. Chhajlany, Kent A. Hallman, Richard F. Haglund, Sokrates T. Pantelides, Maciej Lewenstein, John C. Travers, Allan S. Johnson&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The nature of the insulator-to-metal phase transition in vanadium dioxide (VO2) is one of the longest-standing problems in condensed-matter physics. Ultrafast spectroscopy has long promised to determine whether the transition is primarily driven by the electronic or structural degree of freedom, but measurements to date have been stymied by their sensitivity to only one of these components and/or their limited temporal resolution. Here we use ultra-broadband few-femtosecond pump-probe spectroscopy to resolve the electronic and structural phase transitions in VO2 at their fundamental time scales. We find that the system transforms into a bad-metallic phase within 10 fs after photoexcitation, but requires another 100 fs to complete the transition, during which we observe electronic oscillations and a partial re-opening of the bandgap, signalling a transient semi-metallic state. Comparisons with tensor-network simulations and density-functional theory calculations show these features originate from oscillations around the equilibrium high-symmetry atomic positions during an unprecedentedly fast structural transition, in which the vanadium dimers separate and untwist with two different timescales. Our results resolve the complete structural and electronic nature of the light-induced phase transition in VO2 and establish ultra-broadband few-femtosecond spectroscopy as a powerful new tool for studying quantum materials out of equilibrium.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01266'&gt;arXiv:2402.01266&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 02 Feb 2024 09:39:32 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>LoTR: Low Tensor Rank Weight Adaptation</title>

Widely used LoRA-like methods of fine-tuning LLMs are based on matrix factorization of gradient update. We introduce LoTR, a novel approach for parameter-efficient fine-tuning of LLMs which represents a gradient update to parameters in a form of tensor decomposition. Low-rank adapter for each layer is constructed as a product of three matrices, and tensor structure arises from sharing left and right multipliers of this product among layers. Simultaneous compression of a sequence of layers with low-rank tensor representation allows LoTR to archive even better parameter efficiency then LoRA especially for deep models. Moreover, the core tensor does not depend on original weight dimension and can be made arbitrary small, which allows for extremely cheap and fast downstream fine-tuning.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01376'&gt;arXiv:2402.01376&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 02 Feb 2024 13:00:38 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Confinement in the Transverse Field Ising model on the Heavy Hex lattice</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Joseph Tindall, Dries Sels&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We study the emergence of confinement in the transverse field Ising model on a decorated hexagonal lattice. Using an infinite tensor network state optimised with belief propagation we show how a quench from a broken symmetry state leads to striking nonthermal behaviour underpinned by persistent oscillations and saturation of the entanglement entropy. We explain this phenomenon by constructing a minimal model based on the confinement of elementary excitations, which take the form of various flavors of hadronic quasiparticles due to the unique structure of the lattice. Our model is in excellent agreement with our numerical results. For quenches to larger values of the transverse field and/or from non-symmetry broken states, our numerical results displays the expected signatures of thermalisation: a linear growth of entanglement entropy in time, propagation of correlations and the saturation of observables to their thermal averages. These results provide a physical explanation for the unexpected simulability of a recent large scale quantum computation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01558'&gt;arXiv:2402.01558&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 02 Feb 2024 16:50:20 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Efficiency of neural quantum states in light of the quantum geometric tensor</title>

However, the reason behind the practical improvement in their performance with an increase in the number of parameters is not fully understood. In this work, we systematically study the efficiency of a shallow neural network to represent the ground states in different phases of the spin-1 bilinear-biquadratic chain, as the number of parameters increases. We train our ansatz by a supervised learning procedure, minimizing the infidelity w.r.t. the exact ground state. We observe that the accuracy of our ansatz improves with the network width in most cases, and eventually saturates. We demonstrate that this can be explained by looking at the spectrum of the quantum geometric tensor (QGT), particularly its rank. By introducing an appropriate indicator, we establish that the QGT rank provides a useful diagnostic for the practical representation power of an NQS ansatz.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01565'&gt;arXiv:2402.01565&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 02 Feb 2024 16:58:57 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>An introduction to graphical tensor notation for mechanistic interpretability</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01790</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Jordan K. Taylor&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Graphical tensor notation is a simple way of denoting linear operations on tensors, originating from physics. Modern deep learning consists almost entirely of operations on or between tensors, so easily understanding tensor operations is quite important for understanding these systems. This is especially true when attempting to reverse-engineer the algorithms learned by a neural network in order to understand its behavior: a field known as mechanistic interpretability. It's often easy to get confused about which operations are happening between tensors and lose sight of the overall structure, but graphical tensor notation makes it easier to parse things at a glance and see interesting equivalences. The first half of this document introduces the notation and applies it to some decompositions (SVD, CP, Tucker, and tensor network decompositions), while the second half applies it to some existing some foundational approaches for mechanistically understanding language models, loosely following ``A Mathematical Framework for Transformer Circuits'', then constructing an example ``induction head'' circuit in graphical tensor notation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01790'&gt;arXiv:2402.01790&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 02 Feb 2024 02:56:01 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>tnGPS: Discovering Unknown Tensor Network Structure Search Algorithms via Large Language Models (LLMs)</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02456</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Junhua Zeng, Chao Li, Zhun Sun, Qibin Zhao, Guoxu Zhou&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Tensor networks are efficient for extremely high-dimensional representation, but their model selection, known as tensor network structure search (TN-SS), is a challenging problem. Although several works have targeted TN-SS, most existing algorithms are manually crafted heuristics with poor performance, suffering from the curse of dimensionality and local convergence. In this work, we jump out of the box, studying how to harness large language models (LLMs) to automatically discover new TN-SS algorithms, replacing the involvement of human experts. By observing how human experts innovate in research, we model their common workflow and propose an automatic algorithm discovery framework called tnGPS. The proposed framework is an elaborate prompting pipeline that instruct LLMs to generate new TN-SS algorithms through iterative refinement and enhancement. The experimental results demonstrate that the algorithms discovered by tnGPS exhibit superior performance in benchmarks compared to the current state-of-the-art methods.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02456'&gt;arXiv:2402.02456&lt;/a&gt;] Published Sun, 04 Feb 2024 12:06:13 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

Numerical experiments for 14 complex model problems demonstrate the robustness of the proposed method for dimensions up to 1000, while it shows significantly more accurate results than classical gradient-free optimization methods, as well as approximation and optimization methods based on the popular tensor train decomposition, which represents a simpler case of a tensor network.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02890'&gt;arXiv:2402.02890&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 05 Feb 2024 10:59:12 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Entanglement asymmetry in CFT and its relation to non-topological defects</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03446</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Michele Fossati, Filiberto Ares, Jerome Dubail, Pasquale Calabrese&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The entanglement asymmetry is an information based observable that quantifies the degree of symmetry breaking in a region of an extended quantum system. We investigate this measure in the ground state of one dimensional critical systems described by a CFT. Employing the correspondence between global symmetries and defects, the analysis of the entanglement asymmetry can be formulated in terms of partition functions on Riemann surfaces with multiple non-topological defect lines inserted at their branch cuts. For large subsystems, these partition functions are determined by the scaling dimension of the defects. This leads to our first main observation: at criticality, the entanglement asymmetry acquires a subleading contribution scaling as $\log \ell / \ell$ for large subsystem length $\ell$. Then, as an illustrative example, we consider the XY spin chain, which has a critical line described by the massless Majorana fermion theory and explicitly breaks the $U(1)$ symmetry associated with rotations about the $z$-axis. In this situation the corresponding defect is marginal. Leveraging conformal invariance, we relate the scaling dimension of these defects to the ground state energy of the massless Majorana fermion on a circle with equally-spaced point defects. We exploit this mapping to derive our second main result: the exact expression for the scaling dimension associated with $n$ of defects of arbitrary strengths. Our result generalizes a known formula for the $n=1$ case derived in several previous works. We then use this exact scaling dimension to derive our third main result: the exact prefactor of the $\log \ell/\ell$ term in the asymmetry of the critical XY chain.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03446'&gt;arXiv:2402.03446&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 05 Feb 2024 19:01:09 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Exotic Superfluid with Emergent flux in a one-dimensional Bose-Fermi mixture</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03875</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Qi Song, Jie Lou, Yan Chen&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We find a novel chiral superfluid (CSF) phase in a one-dimensional Bose-Fermi Hubbard model with significant mass and density imbalance between the two species. In the CSF phase, bosons condensate at non-zero momentum $\pm 2\pi /L$ with chain length $L$. To capture the essential physics of this new phenomenon, we study an alternative simplified model that only features competition between single-fermion hopping and hopping of composite particles composed of a fermion and a boson. This model captures the low energy physics of the Hubbard model and hosts a robust CSF phase. Our unbiased numerical studies show that in the CSF phase, the local superfluid order parameter continuously rotates along the chain, indicating that time-reversal symmetry is spontaneously broken. This symmetry breaking generates an emergent flux in the background, effectively optimizing the system's ground-state energy. We provide a physical understanding at the mean-field level. Furthermore, we have explored the potential realization of this phase in cold-atom experiments.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03875'&gt;arXiv:2402.03875&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 06 Feb 2024 10:33:59 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Universal entanglement spectrum in gapless symmetry protected topological states</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Xue-Jia Yu, Sheng Yang, Hai-Qing Lin, Shao-Kai Jian&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Quantum entanglement marks a definitive feature of topological states. However, the entanglement spectrum remains insufficiently explored for topological states without a bulk energy gap. Using a combination of field theory and numerical techniques, we accurately calculate and analyze the entanglement spectrum of gapless symmetry protected topological states in one dimension. We highlight that the universal entanglement spectrum not only encodes the nontrivial edge degeneracy, generalizing the Li-Haldane conjecture to gapless topological states, but also contains the operator content of the underlying boundary conformal field theory. This implies that the bulk wave function can act as a fingerprint of both quantum criticality and topology in gapless symmetry protected topological states. We also identify a symmetry enriched conformal boundary condition that goes beyond the conventional conformal boundary condition.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04042'&gt;arXiv:2402.04042&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 06 Feb 2024 14:41:15 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>First-principles phase diagram of an interacting ionic chain</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Jamin Kidd, Ruiqi Zhang, Shao-Kai Jian, Jianwei Sun&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The widely-used Kohn-Sham implementation of density functional theory (DFT) maps a system of interacting electrons onto an auxiliary non-interacting one and is presumably inaccurate for strongly correlated materials. We present a concrete benchmark for DFT by examining the electronic ground state phase diagram of a strongly interacting chain with uneven, non-integer nuclear charges. The interplay between charge imbalance and Coulomb repulsion yields two competing phases, a band insulator and a Mott insulator. By including infinitesimal lattice distortions, DFT stabilizes the intermediate spontaneously dimerized insulator phase that results from this competition. We assess the phase diagram by mapping the bond length and nuclear charge ratio of the chain to the ionic Hubbard model and performing highly accurate density matrix renormalization group calculations. Our comparative study provides foundational insight into the utility of symmetry-broken DFT as a predictive tool for elucidating phase diagrams with competing orders.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04218'&gt;arXiv:2402.04218&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 06 Feb 2024 18:23:41 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Classical and Quantum Computing of Shear Viscosity for $2+1D$ SU(2) Gauge Theory</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04221</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Francesco Turro, Anthony Ciavarella, Xiaojun Yao&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We perform a nonperturbative calculation of the shear viscosity for $(2+1)$-dimensional SU(2) gauge theory by using the lattice Hamiltonian formulation. The retarded Green's function of the stress-energy tensor is calculated from real time evolution via exact diagonalization of the lattice Hamiltonian with a local Hilbert space truncation, and the shear viscosity is obtained via the Kubo formula. When taking the continuum limit, we account for the renormalization group flow of the coupling but no additional operator renormalization. We find the ratio of the shear viscosity and the entropy density $\frac{\eta}{s}$ is consistent with a well-known holographic result $\frac{1}{4\pi}$ at several temperatures on a $4\times4$ honeycomb lattice with the local electric representation truncated at $j_{\rm max}=\frac{1}{2}$. We also find the ratio of the spectral function and frequency $\frac{\rho^{xy}(\omega)}{\omega}$ exhibits a peak structure when the frequency is small. Both the exact diagonalization method and simple matrix product state classical simulation method beyond $j_{\rm max}=\frac{1}{2}$ on bigger lattices require exponentially growing resources. So we develop a quantum computing method to calculate the retarded Green's function and analyze various systematics of the calculation including $j_{\rm max}$ truncation and finite size effects, Trotter errors and the thermal state preparation efficiency. Our thermal state preparation method still requires resources that grow exponentially with the lattice size, but with a very small prefactor at high temperature. We test our quantum circuit on both the Quantinuum emulator and the IBM simulator for a small lattice and obtain results consistent with the classical computing ones.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04221'&gt;arXiv:2402.04221&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 06 Feb 2024 18:25:41 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>A blockBP decoder for the surface code</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Aviad Kaufmann, Itai Arad&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We present a new decoder for the surface code, which combines the accuracy of the tensor-network decoders with the efficiency and parallelism of the belief-propagation algorithm. Our main idea is to replace the expensive tensor-network contraction step in the tensor-network decoders with the blockBP algorithm - a recent approximate contraction algorithm, based on belief propagation. Our decoder is therefore a belief-propagation decoder that works in the degenerate maximal likelihood decoding framework. Unlike conventional tensor-network decoders, our algorithm can run efficiently in parallel, and may therefore be suitable for real-time decoding. We numerically test our decoder and show that for a large range of lattice sizes and noise levels it delivers a logical error probability that outperforms the Minimal-Weight-Perfect-Matching (MWPM) decoder, sometimes by more than an order of magnitude.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04834'&gt;arXiv:2402.04834&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 07 Feb 2024 13:32:32 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Challenges and opportunities in the supervised learning of quantum circuit outputs</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04992</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Simone Cantori, Sebastiano Pilati&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Recently, deep neural networks have proven capable of predicting some output properties of relevant random quantum circuits, indicating a strategy to emulate quantum computers alternative to direct simulation methods such as, e.g., tensor-network methods. However, the reach of this alternative strategy is not yet clear. Here we investigate if and to what extent neural networks can learn to predict the output expectation values of circuits often employed in variational quantum algorithms, namely, circuits formed by layers of CNOT gates alternated with random single-qubit rotations. On the one hand, we find that the computational cost of supervised learning scales exponentially with the inter-layer variance of the random angles. This allows entering a regime where quantum computers can easily outperform classical neural networks. On the other hand, circuits featuring only inter-qubit angle variations are easily emulated. In fact, thanks to a suitable scalable design, neural networks accurately predict the output of larger and deeper circuits than those used for training, even reaching circuit sizes which turn out to be intractable for the most common simulation libraries, considering both state-vector and tensor-network algorithms. We provide a repository of testing data in this regime, to be used for future benchmarking of quantum devices and novel classical algorithms.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04992'&gt;arXiv:2402.04992&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 07 Feb 2024 16:10:13 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Quantum Tensor Product Decomposition from Choi State Tomography</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Refik Mansuroglu, Arsalan Adil, Michael J. Hartmann, Zoë Holmes, Andrew T. Sornborger&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The Schmidt decomposition is the go-to tool for measuring bipartite entanglement of pure quantum states. Similarly, it is possible to study the entangling features of a quantum operation using its operator-Schmidt, or tensor product decomposition. While quantum technological implementations of the former are thoroughly studied, entangling properties on the operator level are harder to extract in the quantum computational framework because of the exponential nature of sample complexity. Here we present an algorithm for unbalanced partitions into a small subsystem and a large one (the environment) to compute the tensor product decomposition of a unitary whose effect on the small subsystem is captured in classical memory while the effect on the environment is accessible as a quantum resource. This quantum algorithm may be used to make predictions about operator non-locality, effective open quantum dynamics on a subsystem, as well as for finding low-rank approximations and low-depth compilations of quantum circuit unitaries. We demonstrate the method and its applications on a time-evolution unitary of an isotropic Heisenberg model in two dimensions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05018'&gt;arXiv:2402.05018&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 07 Feb 2024 16:36:47 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Realization of Wess-Zumino-Witten transitions with levels $k=6$ and $k=4$ in a frustrated spin-3 chain</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05031</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Natalia Chepiga&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We study dimerization transitions in a frustrated spin-3 chain with next-nearest neighbor and three-site interactions. We show that two independent coupling constants of the model are sufficient to fine-tune the system to the critical point in the Wess-Zumino-Witten SU(2)$_6$ universality class. This critical point appears as the end point of an extended SU(2)$_4$ critical line. This implies that the renormalization group flow lead to the critical theory with the largest level $k$ such that the number of relevant operators is reduced by one and the parity of the level is preserved. Furthermore, we argue that due to the presence of marginal operator there is only one point in the SU(2)$_6$ universality class. In addition, we report the appearance of non-magnetic Ising transition between the topologically trivial uniform and dimerized phases. This transition takes place within the singlet sector, while magnetic gap remains open.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05031'&gt;arXiv:2402.05031&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 07 Feb 2024 17:00:09 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Alberto Giuseppe Catalano&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Matrix product states (MPSs) and matrix product operators (MPOs) are fundamental tools in the study of quantum many-body systems, particularly in the context of tensor network methods such as Time-Evolving Block Decimation (TEBD). However, constructing compact MPO representations for Hamiltonians with interactions beyond nearest-neighbors, such as those arising in AMO systems or in systems with ring geometry, remains a challenge. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for the direct construction of compact MPOs tailored specifically for the exponential of spin Hamiltonians. This approach allows for a more efficient time evolution, using TEBD, of spin systems with interactions beyond nearest-neighbors, such as long-range spin-chains, periodic systems and more complex cluster model, with interactions involving more than two spins.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05198'&gt;arXiv:2402.05198&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 07 Feb 2024 19:08:01 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Block Mott insulating state induced by next-nearest neighbor hopping in the S = 3/2 zigzag chain BaCoTe2O7</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05389</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Ling-Fang Lin, Yang Zhang, Gonzalo Alvarez, Adriana Moreo, Elbio Dagotto&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Quasi-one-dimensional correlated electronic multi-orbital systems with either ladder or chain geometries continue attracting considerable interest due to their complex electronic phases arising from the interplay of the hopping matrix, the crystal-fields splitting, the electronic correlations, and strong quantum fluctuations. Recently, the intriguing cobalt zigzag chain system BaCoTe$_2$O$_7$, with electronic density $n = 7$, was prepared experimentally. Here, we systematically study the electronic and magnetic properties of this quasi-one-dimensional compound from the theory perspective. Based on first-principles density functional theory calculations, strongly anisotropic one-dimensional electronic Co $3d$ bands were found near the Fermi level. By evaluating the relevant hopping amplitudes, we provide the magnitude and origin of the nearest-neighbor (NN) and next nearest-neighbor (NNN) hopping matrices in BaCoTe$_2$O$_7$. With this information, we constructed a three-orbital electronic Hubbard model for this zigzag chain system, and studied two cases: with only a NN hopping matrix, and with NN plus NNN hopping matrices. Introducing the Hubbard and Hund couplings and studying the model via the density matrix renormalization group method, we constructed the ground-state phase diagram. A robust staggered antiferromagnetic (AFM) region was found when only the NN hopping matrix in the chain direction was employed. However, for the realistic case where the NNN hopping matrix is also included, the dominant state becomes instead a block AFM order, in agreement with experiments. The system displays Mott insulator characteristics with three half-filled orbitals, when the block AFM order is stable. Our results for BaCoTe$_2$O$_7$ provide guidance to experimentalists and theorists working on this zigzag one-dimensional chain and related materials.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05389'&gt;arXiv:2402.05389&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 08 Feb 2024 03:57:51 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Noncollinear phase of the antiferromagnetic sawtooth chain</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; R. Rausch, C. Karrasch&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The antiferromagnetic sawtooth chain is a prototypical example of a frustrated spin system with vertex-sharing triangles, giving rise to complex quantum states. Depending on the interaction parameters, this system has three phases, of which the gapless non-collinear phase (for strongly coupled basal spins and loosely attached apical spins) has received little theoretical attention so far. In this work, we comprehensively investigate the properties of the non-collinear phase using large-scale tensor network computations which exploit the full SU(2) symmetry of the underlying Heisenberg model. We study the ground state both for finite systems using the density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) as well as for infinite chains via the variational uniform matrix-product state (VUMPS) formalism. Finite temperatures and correlation functions are tackled via imaginary- or real time evolutions, which we implement using the time-dependent variational principle (TDVP). We find that the non-collinear phase is characterized by a low-momentum peak and a diffuse tail for the apex-apex correlations. Deep into the phase, the pattern sharpens into a peak indicating a 90-degree spiral. The apical spins are soft and highly susceptible to external perturbations; they give rise to a large number of gapless magnetic states that are polarized by weak fields and cause a long low-temperature tail in the specific heat. The dynamic spin-structure factor exhibits additive contributions from a two-spinon continuum (excitations of the basal chain) and a gapless peak at $k=\pi/2$ (excitations of the apical spins). Small temperatures excite the gapless states and smear the spectral weight of the $k=\pi/2$ peak out into a homogeneous flat-band structure. Our results are relevant, e.g., for the material atacamite Cu$_2$Cl(OH)$_3$ in high magnetic fields.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05759'&gt;arXiv:2402.05759&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 08 Feb 2024 15:42:38 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Background independent tensor networks</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05910</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Chris Akers, Annie Y. Wei&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Conventional holographic tensor networks can be described as toy holographic maps constructed from many small linear maps acting in a spatially local way, all connected together with ``background entanglement'', i.e. links of a fixed state, often the maximally entangled state. However, these constructions fall short of modeling real holographic maps. One reason is that their ``areas'' are trivial, taking the same value for all states, unlike in gravity where the geometry is dynamical. Recently, new constructions have ameliorated this issue by adding degrees of freedom that ``live on the links''. This makes areas non-trivial, equal to the background entanglement piece plus a new positive piece that depends on the state of the link degrees of freedom. Nevertheless, this still has the downside that there is background entanglement, and hence it only models relatively limited code subspaces in which every area has a definite minimum value given by the background entanglement. In this note, we simply point out that a version of these constructions goes one step further: they can be background independent, with no background entanglement in the holographic map. This is advantageous because it allows tensor networks to model holographic maps for larger code subspaces. In addition to pointing this out, we address some subtleties involved in making it work and point out a nice connection it offers to recent discussions of random CFT data.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05910'&gt;arXiv:2402.05910&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 08 Feb 2024 18:44:28 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Many-body computing on Field Programmable Gate Arrays</title>

In this study, we leverage the capabilities of Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) for conducting quantum many-body calculations. Through the design of appropriate schemes for Monte Carlo and tensor network methods, we effectively utilize the parallel processing capabilities provided by FPGAs. This has resulted in a tenfold speedup compared to CPU-based computation for a Monte Carlo algorithm. By using a supercell structure and simulating the FPGA architecture on a CPU with High-Level Synthesis, we achieve $O(1)$ scaling for the time of one sweep, regardless of the overall system size. We also demonstrate, for the first time, the utilization of FPGA to accelerate a typical tensor network algorithm for many-body ground state calculations. Additionally, we show that the current FPGA computing acceleration is on par with that of multi-threaded GPU parallel processing. Our findings unambiguously highlight the significant advantages of hardware implementation and pave the way for novel approaches to many-body calculations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06415'&gt;arXiv:2402.06415&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 09 Feb 2024 14:01:02 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Quantum Computing and Tensor Networks for Laminate Design: A Novel Approach to Stacking Sequence Retrieval</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06455</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Arne Wulff, Boyang Chen, Matthew Steinberg, Yinglu Tang, Matthias Möller, Sebastian Feld&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; As with many tasks in engineering, structural design frequently involves navigating complex and computationally expensive problems. A prime example is the weight optimization of laminated composite materials, which to this day remains a formidable task, due to an exponentially large configuration space and non-linear constraints. The rapidly developing field of quantum computation may offer novel approaches for addressing these intricate problems. However, before applying any quantum algorithm to a given problem, it must be translated into a form that is compatible with the underlying operations on a quantum computer. Our work specifically targets stacking sequence retrieval with lamination parameters. To adapt this problem for quantum computational methods, we map the possible stacking sequences onto a quantum state space. We further derive a linear operator, the Hamiltonian, within this state space that encapsulates the loss function inherent to the stacking sequence retrieval problem. Additionally, we demonstrate the incorporation of manufacturing constraints on stacking sequences as penalty terms in the Hamiltonian. This quantum representation is suitable for a variety of classical and quantum algorithms for finding the ground state of a quantum Hamiltonian. For a practical demonstration, we performed state-vector simulations of two variational quantum algorithms and additionally chose a classical tensor network algorithm, the DMRG algorithm, to numerically validate our approach. Although this work primarily concentrates on quantum computation, the application of tensor network algorithms presents a novel quantum-inspired approach for stacking sequence retrieval.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06455'&gt;arXiv:2402.06455&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 09 Feb 2024 15:01:56 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Linear combinations of cluster mean-field states applied to spin systems</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06760</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Athanasios Papastathopoulos-Katsaros, Thomas M. Henderson, Gustavo E. Scuseria&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We present an innovative cluster-based method employing linear combinations of diverse cluster mean-field (cMF) states, and apply it to describe the ground state of strongly-correlated spin systems. In cluster mean-field theory, the ground state wavefunction is expressed as a factorized tensor product of optimized cluster states. While our prior work concentrated on a single cMF tiling, this study removes that constraint by combining different tilings of cMF states. Selection criteria, including translational symmetry and spatial proximity, guide this process. We present benchmark calculations for the one- and two-dimensional $J_1-J_2$ and $XXZ$ Heisenberg models. Our findings highlight two key aspects. First, the method offers a semi-quantitative description of the $0.4 \lessapprox J_2/J_1 \lessapprox 0.6$ regime of the $J_1-J_2$ model - a particularly challenging regime for existing methods. Second, our results demonstrate the capability of our method to provide qualitative descriptions for all the models and regimes considered, establishing it as a valuable reference. However, the inclusion of additional (weak) correlations is necessary for quantitative agreement, and we explore methods to incorporate these extra correlations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06760'&gt;arXiv:2402.06760&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 09 Feb 2024 19:47:28 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Quantum reservoir probing of quantum phase transitions</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07097</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Kaito Kobayashi, Yukitoshi Motome&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Quantum phase transitions are highly remarkable phenomena manifesting in quantum many-body systems. However, their precise identifications in equilibrium systems pose significant theoretical and experimental challenges. Thus far, dynamical detection protocols employing global quantum quenches have been proposed, wherein transitions are discerned via global nonequilibrium excitations. In this work, we demonstrate that quantum phase transitions can be detected through localized out-of-equilibrium excitations induced by local quantum quenches. While the resulting dynamics after the quench is influenced by both the local quench operation and the intrinsic dynamics of the quantum system, the effects of the former are exclusively extracted using the cutting-edge framework called quantum reservoir probing (QRP). Through the QRP, we find that the impacts of the local quenches vary across different quantum phases and are significantly suppressed by quantum fluctuations amplified near quantum critical points; consequently, phase boundaries are precisely delineated. We demonstrate that the QRP can detect quantum phase transitions in the paradigmatic integrable and nonintegrable quantum spin systems, and even topological quantum phase transitions, all within the identical framework employing local quantum quenches and single-site observables.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07097'&gt;arXiv:2402.07097&lt;/a&gt;] Published Sun, 11 Feb 2024 03:53:01 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Mazen Ali, Matthias Kabel&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; This work introduces a novel method for embedding continuous variables into quantum circuits via piecewise polynomial features, utilizing low-rank tensor networks. Our approach, termed Piecewise Polynomial Tensor Network Quantum Feature Encoding (PPTNQFE), aims to broaden the applicability of quantum algorithms by incorporating spatially localized representations suited for numerical applications like partial differential equations and function regression. We demonstrate the potential of PPTNQFE through efficient point evaluations of solutions of discretized differential equations and in modeling functions with localized features such as jump discontinuities. While promising, challenges such as unexplored noise impact and design of trainable circuits remain. This study opens new avenues for enhancing quantum models with novel feature embeddings and leveraging TN representations for a wider array of function types in quantum machine learning.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07671'&gt;arXiv:2402.07671&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 12 Feb 2024 14:26:33 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Computational complexity of isometric tensor network states</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07975</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Daniel Malz, Rahul Trivedi&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We determine the computational power of isometric tensor network states (isoTNS), a variational ansatz originally developed to numerically find and compute properties of gapped ground states and topological states in two dimensions. By mapping 2D isoTNS to 1+1D unitary quantum circuits, we find that computing local expectation values in isoTNS is $\textsf{BQP}$-complete. We then introduce injective isoTNS, which are those isoTNS that are the unique ground states of frustration-free Hamiltonians, and which are characterized by an injectivity parameter $\delta\in(0,1/D]$, where $D$ is the bond dimension of the isoTNS. We show that injectivity necessarily adds depolarizing noise to the circuit at a rate $\eta=\delta^2D^2$. We show that weakly injective isoTNS (small $\delta$) are still $\textsf{BQP}$-complete, but that there exists an efficient classical algorithm to compute local expectation values in strongly injective isoTNS ($\eta\geq0.41$). Sampling from isoTNS corresponds to monitored quantum dynamics and we exhibit a family of isoTNS that undergo a phase transition from a hard regime to an easy phase where the monitored circuit can be sampled efficiently. Our results can be used to design provable algorithms to contract isoTNS. Our mapping between ground states of certain frustration-free Hamiltonians to open circuit dynamics in one dimension fewer may be of independent interest.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07975'&gt;arXiv:2402.07975&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 12 Feb 2024 19:00:00 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Path integral Lindblad master equation through transfer tensor method &amp; the generalized quantum master equation</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08518</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Amartya Bose&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Path integrals have, over the years, proven to be an extremely versatile tool for simulating the dynamics of open quantum systems. The initial limitations of applicability of these methods in terms of the size of the system has steadily been overcome through various developments, making numerical explorations of large systems a more-or-less regular feature. However, these simulations necessitate a detailed description of the system-environment interaction through accurate spectral densities, which are often difficult to obtain. Additionally, for several processes, such as spontaneous emission, one only has access to a rough estimation of an empirical timescale, and it is not possible to really define a proper spectral density at all. In this communication, an approach of incorporating such processes within an exact path integral description of other dissipative modes is developed through the Nakajima-Zwanzig master equations. This method will allow for a numerically exact non-perturbative inclusion of the degrees of freedom that are properly described by a bath using path integrals, while incorporating the empirical time scale through the Lindblad master equation. The cost of this approach is dominated by the cost of the path integral method used, and the impact of the Lindbladian terms is effectively obtained for free. This path integral Lindblad dynamics method is demonstrated with the example of electronic excitation transfer in a 4-site model of the Fenna-Matthews-Olson complex with the exciton has a propensity of being "lost" to the charge transfer state at the third chromophore. The impact of different time-scales of abstraction of the exciton is illustrated at no extra cost.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08518'&gt;arXiv:2402.08518&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 13 Feb 2024 15:15:48 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Tensor network noise characterization for near-term quantum computers</title>

Rossi, Guillermo García-Pérez&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Characterization of noise in current near-term quantum devices is of paramount importance to fully use their computational power. However, direct quantum process tomography becomes unfeasible for systems composed of tens of qubits. A promising alternative method based on tensor networks was recently proposed [Nat. Commun. 14, 2858 (2023)]. In this paper, we adapt it for the characterization of noise channels on near-term quantum computers and investigate its performance thoroughly. In particular, we show how experimentally feasible tomographic samples are sufficient to accurately characterize realistic correlated noise models affecting individual layers of quantum circuits, and study its performance on systems composed of up to 20 qubits. Furthermore, we combine this noise characterization method with a recently proposed noise-aware tensor network error mitigation protocol for correcting outcomes in noisy circuits, resulting accurate estimations even on deep circuit instances. This positions the tensor-network-based noise characterization protocol as a valuable tool for practical error characterization and mitigation in the near-term quantum computing era.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08556'&gt;arXiv:2402.08556&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 13 Feb 2024 15:57:47 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Study of local conserved quantities in the one-dimensional Hubbard model</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08924</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Kohei Fukai&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; In this thesis, I study the local charges $\{Q_k\}$ in the one-dimensional Hubbard model, which is an integrable system used for theoretical studies of non-perturbative effects in strongly correlated electron systems. I obtained their explicit expressions in a closed form. An expression of the $k$-local charge $Q_k$ for $k &gt; 5$, where $k$ denotes the support, had been unknown in previous studies. I find that $Q_k$ is a linear combination of a particular kind of products of the hopping terms. I introduce a diagrammatic notation to represent these products efficiently, which enables the prediction of the general formula of the local charges. These linear combinations have non-trivial coefficients for $k &gt; 5$, and some of the coefficients were proved to be identical to the generalized Catalan numbers, which also appear in the local charges of the Heisenberg chain. I derive the recursion equation for these coefficients. I also prove that the obtained local charges are exhaustive. Thus, any local charge is written as a linear combination of $\{Q_k\}$. Although the completeness of the local charges is a natural conjecture in the transfer-matrix formulation, its proof has not been presented for almost all cases. Lastly, I emphasize that this is the first study demonstrating general explicit expressions of the local charges for an electron system that lacks the boost operator.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08924'&gt;arXiv:2402.08924&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 14 Feb 2024 03:46:13 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

In the noninteracting case, quantized Thouless pumps can only occur when a topological singularity is encircled adiabatically. In contrast, here we show that, in the presence of interactions, such topological transport can even persist for exotic paths in which the system gets arbitrarily close to the noninteracting singularity. We illustrate the robustness of these exotic Thouless pumps through the behavior of the noninteracting singularity, which for sufficiently strong interactions splits into two singularities separated by a spontaneous antiferromagnetic insulator. We perform a numerical benchmark of these phenomena by means of tensor network simulations of ground-state physics and real-time adiabatic dynamics. Finally, we propose an experimental protocol with Floquet-driven Rydberg tweezer arrays.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09311'&gt;arXiv:2402.09311&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 14 Feb 2024 16:58:21 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

Here, we review a relatively new class of variational states for the simulation of such systems, namely neural quantum states (NQS), which overcome the exponential scaling by compressing the state in terms of the network parameters rather than storing all exponentially many coefficients needed for an exact parameterization of the state. We introduce the commonly used NQS architectures and their various applications for the simulation of ground and excited states, finite temperature and open system states as well as NQS approaches to simulate the dynamics of quantum states. Furthermore, we discuss NQS in the context of quantum state tomography.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09402'&gt;arXiv:2402.09402&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 14 Feb 2024 18:59:16 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Replica topological order in quantum mixed states and quantum error correction</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09516</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Zhuan Li, Roger S. K. Mong&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Topological phases of matter offer a promising platform for quantum computation and quantum error correction. Nevertheless, unlike its counterpart in pure states, descriptions of topological order in mixed states remain relatively under-explored. Our work give two definitions for replica topological order in mixed states, which involve $n$ copies of density matrices of the mixed state. Our framework categorizes topological orders in mixed states as either quantum, classical, or trivial, depending on the type of information that can be encoded. For the case of the toric code model in the presence of decoherence, we associate for each phase a quantum channel and describes the structure of the code space. We show that in the quantum-topological phase, there exists a postselection-based error correction protocol that recovers the quantum information, while in the classical-topological phase, the quantum information has decohere and cannot be fully recovered. We accomplish this by describing the mixed state as a projected entangled pairs state (PEPS) and identifying the symmetry-protected topological order of its boundary state to the bulk topology. We discuss the extent that our findings can be extrapolated to $n \to 1$ limit.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09516'&gt;arXiv:2402.09516&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 14 Feb 2024 19:00:03 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

Using the Kramers-Wannier duality operator, we also construct the Kennedy-Tasaki transformation that maps subsystem symmetry-protected topological phases to spontaneous subsystem symmetry breaking phases, where the symmetry group for the former is either $\mathbb{Z}_2\times\mathbb{Z}_2$ or $\mathbb{Z}_2$. This generalizes the recently proposed picture of one-dimensional Kennedy-Tasaki transformation as a composition of manipulations involving gauging and stacking symmetry-protected topological phases to higher dimensions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09520'&gt;arXiv:2402.09520&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 14 Feb 2024 19:00:19 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Introduction to quantum entanglement in many-body systems</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09523</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Anubhav Kumar Srivastava, Guillem Müller-Rigat, Maciej Lewenstein, Grzegorz Rajchel-Mieldzioć&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The quantum mechanics formalism introduced new revolutionary concepts challenging our everyday perceptions. Arguably, quantum entanglement, which explains correlations that cannot be reproduced classically, is the most notable of them. Besides its fundamental aspect, entanglement is also a resource, fueling emergent technologies such as quantum simulators and computers. The purpose of this chapter is to give a pedagogical introduction to the topic with a special emphasis on the multipartite scenario, i.e., entanglement distributed among many degrees of freedom. Due to the combinatorial complexity of this setting, particles can interact and become entangled in a plethora of ways, which we characterize here. We start by providing the necessary mathematical tools and elementary concepts from entanglement theory. A part of this chapter will be devoted to classifying and ordering entangled states. Then, we focus on various entanglement structures useful in condensed-matter theory such as tensor-network states or symmetric states useful for quantum-enhanced sensing. Finally, we discuss state-of-the-art methods to detect and certify such correlations in experiments, with some relevant illustrative examples.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09523'&gt;arXiv:2402.09523&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 14 Feb 2024 19:01:10 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Tradeoff relations in open quantum dynamics via Robertson, Maccone-Pati, and Robertson-Schrödinger uncertainty relations</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09680</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Tomohiro Nishiyama, Yoshihiko Hasegawa&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The Heisenberg uncertainty relation, together with Robertson's generalisation, serves as a fundamental concept in quantum mechanics, showing that noncommutative pairs of observables cannot be measured precisely. In this study, we explore the Robertson-type uncertainty relations to demonstrate their effectiveness in establishing a series of thermodynamic uncertainty relations and quantum speed limits in open quantum dynamics. The derivation utilises a scaled continuous matrix product state representation that maps the time evolution of the quantum continuous measurement to the time evolution of the system and field. Specifically, we consider the Maccone-Pati uncertainty relation, a refinement of the Robertson uncertainty relation, to derive thermodynamic uncertainty relations and quantum speed limits. These newly derived relations, which use a state orthogonal to the initial state, yield bounds that are tighter than previously known bounds. Moreover, we consider the Robertson-Schrödinger uncertainty, which extends the Robertson uncertainty relation. Our findings not only reinforce the significance of the Robertson-type uncertainty relations, but also expand its applicability in identifying uncertainty relations in open quantum dynamics.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09680'&gt;arXiv:2402.09680&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 15 Feb 2024 03:31:38 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

Leveraging great expressive power and efficient gradient-based optimization, researchers have shown that trial states inspired by deep learning problems can accurately model many-body correlated phenomena in spin, fermionic and qubit systems. In this review, we derive the central equations of different flavors variational Monte Carlo (VMC) approaches, including ground state search, time evolution and overlap optimization, and discuss data-driven tasks like quantum state tomography. An emphasis is put on the geometry of the variational manifold as well as bottlenecks in practical implementations. An overview of recent results of first-principles ground-state and real-time calculations is provided.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11014'&gt;arXiv:2402.11014&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 16 Feb 2024 19:00:01 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Exploring the Phase Diagram of the quantum one-dimensional ANNNI model</title>

Vallecorsa&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; In this manuscript, we explore the intersection of QML and TN in the context of the one-dimensional ANNNI model with a transverse field. The study aims to concretely connect QML and TN by combining them in various stages of algorithm construction, focusing on phase diagram reconstruction for the ANNNI model, with supervised and unsupervised techniques. The model's significance lies in its representation of quantum fluctuations and frustrated exchange interactions, making it a paradigm for studying magnetic ordering, frustration, and the presence of a floating phase. It concludes with discussions of the results, including insights from increased system sizes and considerations for future work, such as addressing limitations in QCNN and exploring more realistic implementations of QC.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11022'&gt;arXiv:2402.11022&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 16 Feb 2024 19:04:10 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Interpolating many-body wave functions for accelerated molecular dynamics on the near-exact electronic surface</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11097</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Yannic Rath, George H. Booth&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; While there have been many developments in computational probes of both strongly-correlated molecular systems and machine-learning accelerated molecular dynamics, there remains a significant gap in capabilities in simulating accurate non-local electronic structure over timescales on which atoms move. We develop an approach to bridge these fields with a practical interpolation scheme for the correlated many-electron state through the space of atomic configurations, whilst avoiding the exponential complexity of these underlying electronic states. With a small number of accurate correlated wave functions as a training set, we demonstrate provable convergence to near-exact potential energy surfaces for subsequent dynamics with propagation of a valid many-body wave function and inference of its variational energy whilst retaining a mean-field computational scaling. This represents a profoundly different paradigm to the direct interpolation of potential energy surfaces in established machine-learning approaches. We combine this with modern electronic structure approaches to systematically resolve molecular dynamics trajectories and converge thermodynamic quantities with a high-throughput of several million interpolated wave functions with explicit validation of their accuracy from only a few numerically exact quantum chemical calculations. We also highlight the comparison to traditional machine-learned potentials or dynamics on mean-field surfaces.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11097'&gt;arXiv:2402.11097&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 16 Feb 2024 22:03:37 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Spin dynamics and dark particle in a weak-coupled quantum Ising ladder with $\mathcal{D}_8^{(1)}$ spectrum</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11229</link>

The system is remarkable for including eight types of massive relativistic particles, with their scattering matrix and mass spectrum characterized by the $\mathcal{D}_8^{(1)}$ Lie algebra. In this article, by computing the spin dynamical structure factors following analytical form factor approach, we clearly identify dispersive single-particle excitations of (anti-) soliton and breathers as well as their multi-particle continua in the spectra, which is further confirmed by the numerical simulations. We show that the selection rule inherent in the parity and topological charge of the theory, causes a significant result that charge-parity-odd particles, termed as dark particles, cannot be directly excited from the ground state through any local or quasi-local operations. This in turn suggests the long lifetime of the lightest dark particle.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11229'&gt;arXiv:2402.11229&lt;/a&gt;] Published Sat, 17 Feb 2024 09:12:59 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Superconductivity enhancement and particle-hole asymmetry: interplay with electron attraction in doped Hubbard model</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11255</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Zhi Xu, Hong-Chen Jiang, Yi-Fan Jiang&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The role of near-neighbor electron attraction $V$ in strongly correlated systems has been at the forefront of recent research of unconventional superconductivity. However, its implications in the doped Hubbard model on expansive systems remain predominantly unexplored. In this study, we employ the density-matrix renormalization group to examine its effect in the lightly doped $t$-$t'$-Hubbard model on six-leg square cylinders, where $t$ and $t'$ are the first and second neighbor electron hopping amplitudes. For positive $t'$ in the electron-doped case, our results show that the attractive $V$ can significantly enhance the superconducting correlations and drive the system into a pronounced superconducting phase when the attraction exceeds a modest value $V_c \approx 0.7t$. In contrast, in the hole-doped regime with negative $t' $, while heightened superconducting correlations have also been observed in the charge stripe phase, the systems remain insulating with pronounced charge density wave order. Our results demonstrate the importance of the electron attraction in boosting superconductivity in broader doped Hubbard systems and highlight the asymmetry between the electron and hole-doped regimes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11255'&gt;arXiv:2402.11255&lt;/a&gt;] Published Sat, 17 Feb 2024 11:31:39 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>LoRETTA: Low-Rank Economic Tensor-Train Adaptation for Ultra-Low-Parameter Fine-Tuning of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11417</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Yifan Yang, Jiajun Zhou, Ngai Wong, Zheng Zhang&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Various parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques have been proposed to enable computationally efficient fine-tuning while maintaining model performance. However, existing PEFT methods are still limited by the growing number of trainable parameters with the rapid deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs). To address this challenge, we present LoRETTA, an ultra-parameter-efficient framework that significantly reduces trainable parameters through tensor-train decomposition. Specifically, we propose two methods, named {LoRETTA}$_{adp}$ and {LoRETTA}$_{rep}$. The former employs tensorized adapters, offering a high-performance yet lightweight approach for the fine-tuning of LLMs. The latter emphasizes fine-tuning via weight parameterization with a set of small tensor factors. LoRETTA achieves comparable or better performance than most widely used PEFT methods with up to $100\times$ fewer parameters on the LLaMA-2-7B models. Furthermore, empirical results demonstrate that the proposed method effectively improves training efficiency, enjoys better multi-task learning performance, and enhances the anti-overfitting capability. Plug-and-play codes built upon the Huggingface framework and PEFT library will be released.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11417'&gt;arXiv:2402.11417&lt;/a&gt;] Published Sun, 18 Feb 2024 01:20:00 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Extraction of nonlinearity in neural networks with Koopman operator</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11740</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Naoki Sugishita, Kayo Kinjo, Jun Ohkubo&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Nonlinearity plays a crucial role in deep neural networks. In this paper, we investigate the degree to which the nonlinearity of the neural network is essential. For this purpose, we employ the Koopman operator, extended dynamic mode decomposition, and the tensor-train format. The Koopman operator approach has been recently developed in physics and nonlinear sciences; the Koopman operator deals with the time evolution in the observable space instead of the state space. Since we can replace the nonlinearity in the state space with the linearity in the observable space, it is a hopeful candidate for understanding complex behavior in nonlinear systems. Here, we analyze learned neural networks for the classification problems. As a result, the replacement of the nonlinear middle layers with the Koopman matrix yields enough accuracy in numerical experiments. In addition, we confirm that the pruning of the Koopman matrix gives sufficient accuracy even at high compression ratios. These results indicate the possibility of extracting some features in the neural networks with the Koopman operator approach.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11740'&gt;arXiv:2402.11740&lt;/a&gt;] Published Sun, 18 Feb 2024 23:54:35 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Orbital-rotated Fermi-Hubbard model as a benchmarking problem for quantum chemistry with the exact solution</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11869</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Ryota Kojima, Masahiko Kamoshita, Keita Kanno&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Quantum chemistry is a key target for quantum computing, but benchmarking quantum algorithms for large molecular systems remains challenging due to the lack of exactly solvable yet structurally realistic models. In particular, molecular Hamiltonians typically contain $O(N^4)$ Pauli terms, significantly increasing the cost of quantum simulations, while many exactly solvable models, such as the one-dimensional Fermi-Hubbard (1D FH) model, contain only $O(N)$ terms. In this work, we introduce the orbital-rotated Fermi-Hubbard (ORFH) model as a scalable and exactly solvable benchmarking problem for quantum chemistry algorithms. Starting from the 1D FH model, we apply a spin-involved orbital rotation to construct a Hamiltonian that retains the exact ground-state energy but exhibits a Pauli term count scaling as $O(N^4)$, similar to real molecular systems. We analyze the ORFH Hamiltonian from multiple perspectives, including operator norm and electronic correlation. We benchmark variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) optimizers and Pauli term grouping methods, and compare their performance with those for hydrogen chains. Furthermore, we show that the ORFH Hamiltonian increases the computational difficulty for classical methods such as the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG), offering a nontrivial benchmark beyond quantum algorithms. Our results demonstrate that the ORFH model provides a versatile and scalable testbed for benchmarking quantum chemistry algorithms under realistic structural conditions, while maintaining exact solvability even at large system sizes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11869'&gt;arXiv:2402.11869&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 19 Feb 2024 06:24:54 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>A joint optimization approach of parameterized quantum circuits with a tensor network</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12105</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Clara Ferreira Cores, Kaur Kristjuhan, Mark Nicholas Jones&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Despite the advantage quantum computers are expected to deliver when performing simulations compared to their classical counterparts, the current noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices remain limited in their capabilities. The training of parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) remains a significant practical challenge, exacerbated by the requirement of shallow circuit depth necessary for their hardware implementation. Hybrid methods employing classical computers alongside quantum devices, such as the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE), have proven useful for analyzing the capabilities of NISQ devices to solve relevant optimization problems. Still, in the simulation of complex structures involving the many-body problem in quantum mechanics, major issues remain about the representation of the system and obtaining results which clearly outperform classical computational devices. In this research contribution we propose the use of parameterized Tensor Networks (TNs) to attempt an improved performance of the VQE algorithm. A joint approach is presented where the Hamiltonian of a system is encapsulated into a Matrix Product Operator (MPO) within a parameterized unitary TN hereby splitting up the optimization task between the TN and the VQE. We show that the hybrid TN-VQE implementation improves the convergence of the algorithm in comparison to optimizing randomly-initialized quantum circuits via VQE.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12105'&gt;arXiv:2402.12105&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 19 Feb 2024 12:53:52 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>A Riemannian rank-adaptive method for higher-order tensor completion in the tensor-train format</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12182</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Charlotte Vermeylen, Marc Van Barel&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; In this paper a new Riemannian rank adaptive method (RRAM) is proposed for the low-rank tensor completion problem (LRTCP) formulated as a least-squares optimization problem on the algebraic variety of tensors of bounded tensor-train (TT) rank. The method iteratively optimizes over fixed-rank smooth manifolds using a Riemannian conjugate gradient algorithm from Steinlechner (2016) and gradually increases the rank by computing a descent direction in the tangent cone to the variety. Additionally, a numerical method to estimate the amount of rank increase is proposed based on a theoretical result for the stationary points of the low-rank tensor approximation problem and a definition of an estimated TT-rank. Furthermore, when the iterate comes close to a lower-rank set, the RRAM decreases the rank based on the TT-rounding algorithm from Oseledets (2011) and a definition of a numerical rank. We prove that the TT-rounding algorithm can be considered as an approximate projection onto the lower-rank set which satisfies a certain angle condition to ensure that the image is sufficiently close to that of an exact projection. Several numerical experiments are given to illustrate the use of the RRAM and its subroutines in {\Matlab}. Furthermore, in all experiments the proposed RRAM outperforms the state-of-the-art RRAM for tensor completion in the TT format from Steinlechner (2016) in terms of computation time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12182'&gt;arXiv:2402.12182&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 19 Feb 2024 14:42:29 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Quantum phase transitions in one-dimensional nanostructures: a comparison between DFT and DMRG methodologies</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12463</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; T. Pauletti, M. Sanino, L. Gimenes, I. M. Carvalho, V. V. França&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; In the realm of quantum chemistry, the accurate prediction of electronic structure and properties of nanostructures remains a formidable challenge. Density Functional Theory (DFT) and Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) have emerged as two powerful computational methods for addressing electronic correlation effects in diverse molecular systems. We compare ground-state energies ($e_0$), density profiles ($n$) and average entanglement entropies ($\bar S$) in metals, insulators and at the transition from metal to insulator, in homogeneous, superlattices and harmonically confined chains described by the fermionic one-dimensional Hubbard model. While for the homogeneous systems there is a clear hierarchy between the deviations, $D\%(\bar S)&lt;D\%(e_0)&lt; \bar D\%(n)$, and all the deviations decrease with the chain size; for superlattices and harmonical confinement the relation among the deviations is less trivial and strongly dependent on the superlattice structure and the confinement strength considered. For the superlattices, in general increasing the number of impurities in the unit cell represents less precision on the DFT calculations. For the confined chains, DFT performs better for metallic phases, while the highest deviations appear for the Mott and band-insulator phases. This work provides a comprehensive comparative analysis of these methodologies, shedding light on their respective strengths, limitations, and applications.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12463'&gt;arXiv:2402.12463&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 19 Feb 2024 19:10:00 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Density matrix renormalization group study of the interacting Kitaev chain with quasi-periodic disorder</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; K. S. C. Decker, C. Karrasch&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We document the ground state phase diagram of the one-dimensional Kitaev chain with quasi-periodic disorder in the presence of two-body interactions. Our data was obtained for systems of $L=1000$ sites using large-scale density matrix renormalization group numerics and is benchmarked against known results for the clean system. We demonstrate that moderate quasi-periodic disorder stabilizes the topological phase both for repulsive and attractive interactions. For larger disorder strengths, the system features re-entrance behavior and multiple phase transitions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12897'&gt;arXiv:2402.12897&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 20 Feb 2024 10:45:33 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Tensor Completion with BMD Factor Nuclear Norm Minimization</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13068</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Fan Tian, Mirjeta Pasha, Misha E. Kilmer, Eric Miller, Abani Patra&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; This paper is concerned with the problem of recovering third-order tensor data from limited samples. A recently proposed tensor decomposition (BMD) method has been shown to efficiently compress third-order spatiotemporal data. Using the BMD, we formulate a slicewise nuclear norm penalized algorithm to recover a third-order tensor from limited observed samples. We develop an efficient alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) scheme to solve the resulting minimization problem. Experimental results on real data show our method to give reconstruction comparable to those of HaLRTC (Liu et al., IEEE Trans Ptrn Anal Mchn Int, 2012), a well-known tensor completion method, in about the same number of iterations. However, our method has the advantage of smaller subproblems and higher parallelizability per iteration.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13068'&gt;arXiv:2402.13068&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 20 Feb 2024 15:08:27 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Measurement-induced phase transitions by matrix product states scaling</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13160</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Guillaume Cecile, Hugo Lóio, Jacopo De Nardis&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We study the time evolution of long quantum spin chains subjected to continuous monitoring via matrix product states (MPS) at fixed bond dimension, with the Time-Dependent Variational Principle (TDVP) algorithm. The latter gives an effective classical non-linear evolution with a conserved charge, which approximates the real quantum evolution up to an error. We show that the error rate displays a phase transition in the monitoring strength, which can be well detected by scaling analysis with relatively low values of bond dimensions. The method allows for an efficient numerical determination of the critical measurement-induced phase transition parameters in many-body quantum systems. Moreover, in the presence of U(1) global spin charge, we show the existence of a charge-sharpening transition well separated from the entanglement transition which we detect by studying the charge fluctuations of a local sub-part of the system at very large times. Our work substantiates the TDVP time evolution as a method to identify measured-induced phase transitions in systems of arbitrary dimensions and sizes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13160'&gt;arXiv:2402.13160&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 20 Feb 2024 17:22:36 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Generalizing measurement-induced phase transitions to information exchange symmetry breaking</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13271</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Shane P. Kelly, Jamir Marino&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; In this work we investigate the conditions for quantum back action to result in a phase transition in the information dynamics of a monitored system. We introduce a framework that captures a wide range of experiments encompassing probes comprised of projective measurements and probes which more generally transfer quantum information from the system to a quantum computer. Our framework explicitly uses a model of unitary evolution which couples system, apparatus and environment. Information dynamics is investigated using the Rényi and von-Neumann entropies of the evolving state, and we construct a replica theory for them. We identify the possible replica symmetries an experiment can possess and discuss their spontaneous symmetry breaking. In particular, we identify a minimum subgroup whose spontaneous symmetry breaking results in an entanglement transition. This symmetry is only possible when the information in the apparatus is as informative about the dynamics of the system as the information transferred to the environment. We call this requirement the information exchange symmetry and quantify it by a relationship between the entropies. We then show how the entanglement transition can be understood as the spontaneously breaking of the information exchange symmetry and without referring to the replica theory. Information exchange symmetry breaking is then shown to generalize the phenomenology of the measurement-induced phase transition (MIPT). We apply this theory to the brickwork quantum-enhanced experiment introduced in an accompanying Letter [Phys. Rev. A 111, L010402 (2025) ] in the case where the unitaries are chosen from the Haar measure, and identify a distinct universality from the MIPT. This notion of information exchange symmetry breaking generalizes the MIPT, and provides a framework for understanding the dynamics of quantum information in quantum-enhanced experiments.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13271'&gt;arXiv:2402.13271&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 16 Feb 2024 19:32:15 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

We simulate the time evolution of entanglement entropy and mutual information following quench from the Néel state in this system using tensor networks. We find that the entanglement entropy for non-integrable systems saturates to a constant value at late times, however it continues to oscillate for integrable systems. We also find that mutual information peaks as a function of distance between intervals decay faster for non-integrable systems compared to integrable systems, in agreement with the conclusion of \cite{Alba:2019ybw} for XXZ chains. We compare the oscillations in entanglement entropy evolution obtained from simulations in the integrable case with analytic results from quasi-particle picture and find agreement.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13558'&gt;arXiv:2402.13558&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 21 Feb 2024 06:26:48 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Itinerant magnetism and magnetic polarons in the triangular lattice Hubbard model</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14074</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Ivan Morera, Eugene Demler&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We use density matrix renormalization group to investigate the phase diagram of the Fermi Hubbard model on a triangular lattice with densities above half-filling, $1 \leq n &lt; 2$. We discuss the important role of kinetic magnetism and magnetic polarons. For strong interactions and low doublon dopings, attractive interaction between polarons results in phase separation between the fully polarized state at finite doping and the commensurate spin-density wave state at half-filling. For intermediate interaction strength and small doping, competition between antiferromagnetic superexchange and kinetic magnetism gives rise to the incommensurate spin density wave (I-SDW) phase. Fully polarized ferromagnetic (FPF) phase for weak interactions is limited to dopings close to the van Hove singularity in the density of states. With increasing interactions the FPF phase expands to lower dopings. For strong interactions it reaches the low doping regime and is better understood as arising from proliferation of Nagaoka-type ferromagnetic polarons. Other phases that we find include a partially polarized phase, another type of I-SDW at high densities, and Müller-Hartmann ferromagnetism close to the band insulating regime.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14074'&gt;arXiv:2402.14074&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 21 Feb 2024 19:01:12 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Quantum state preparation of topological chiral spin liquids via Floquet engineering</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14141</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Matthieu Mambrini, Didier Poilblanc&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; In condensed matter, Chiral Spin Liquids (CSL) are quantum spin analogs of electronic Fractional Quantum Hall states (in the continuum) or Fractional Chern Insulators (on the lattice). As the latter, CSL are remarquable states of matter, exhibiting topological order and chiral edge modes. Preparing CSL on quantum simulators like cold atom platforms is still an open challenge. Here we propose a simple setup on a finite cluster of spin-1/2 located at the sites of a square lattice. Using a Resonating Valence Bond (RVB) non-chiral spin liquid as initial state on which fast time-modulations of strong nearest-neighbor Heisenberg couplings are applied, following different protocols (out-of-equilibrium quench or semi-adiabatic ramping of the drive), we show the slow emergence of such a CSL phase. An effective Floquet dynamics, obtained from a high-frequency Magnus expansion of the drive Hamiltonian, provides a very accurate and simple framework fully capturing the out-of-equilibrium dynamics. An analysis of the resulting prepared states in term of Projected Entangled Pair states gives further insights on the topological nature of the chiral phase. Finally, we discuss possible applications to quantum computing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14141'&gt;arXiv:2402.14141&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 21 Feb 2024 21:49:16 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Efficient construction of the Feynman-Vernon influence functional as matrix product states</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14350</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Chu Guo, Ruofan Chen&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The time-evolving matrix product operator (TEMPO) method has become a very competitive numerical method for studying the real-time dynamics of quantum impurity problems. For small impurities, the most challenging calculation in TEMPO is to construct the matrix product state representation of the Feynman-Vernon influence functional. In this work we propose an efficient method for this task, which exploits the time-translationally invariant property of the influence functional. The required number of matrix product state multiplication in our method is almost independent of the total evolution time, as compared to the method originally used in TEMPO which requires a linearly scaling number of multiplications. The accuracy and efficiency of this method are demonstrated for the Toulouse model and the single impurity Anderson model.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14350'&gt;arXiv:2402.14350&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 22 Feb 2024 07:48:33 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Generative Modelling with Tensor Train approximations of Hamilton--Jacobi--Bellman equations</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15285</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; David Sommer, Robert Gruhlke, Max Kirstein, Martin Eigel, Claudia Schillings&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Sampling from probability densities is a common challenge in fields such as Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) and Generative Modelling (GM). In GM in particular, the use of reverse-time diffusion processes depending on the log-densities of Ornstein-Uhlenbeck forward processes are a popular sampling tool. In Berner et al. [2022] the authors point out that these log-densities can be obtained by solution of a \textit{Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman} (HJB) equation known from stochastic optimal control. While this HJB equation is usually treated with indirect methods such as policy iteration and unsupervised training of black-box architectures like Neural Networks, we propose instead to solve the HJB equation by direct time integration, using compressed polynomials represented in the Tensor Train (TT) format for spatial discretization. Crucially, this method is sample-free, agnostic to normalization constants and can avoid the curse of dimensionality due to the TT compression. We provide a complete derivation of the HJB equation's action on Tensor Train polynomials and demonstrate the performance of the proposed time-step-, rank- and degree-adaptive integration method on a nonlinear sampling task in 20 dimensions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15285'&gt;arXiv:2402.15285&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 23 Feb 2024 12:30:20 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>A Quantum-Classical Collaborative Training Architecture Based on Quantum State Fidelity</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15333</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Ryan L'Abbate, Anthony D'Onofrio Jr., Samuel Stein, Samuel Yen-Chi Chen, Ang Li, Pin-Yu Chen, Juntao Chen, Ying Mao&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Recent advancements have highlighted the limitations of current quantum systems, particularly the restricted number of qubits available on near-term quantum devices. This constraint greatly inhibits the range of applications that can leverage quantum computers. Moreover, as the available qubits increase, the computational complexity grows exponentially, posing additional challenges. Consequently, there is an urgent need to use qubits efficiently and mitigate both present limitations and future complexities. To address this, existing quantum applications attempt to integrate classical and quantum systems in a hybrid framework. In this study, we concentrate on quantum deep learning and introduce a collaborative classical-quantum architecture called co-TenQu. The classical component employs a tensor network for compression and feature extraction, enabling higher-dimensional data to be encoded onto logical quantum circuits with limited qubits. On the quantum side, we propose a quantum-state-fidelity-based evaluation function to iteratively train the network through a feedback loop between the two sides. co-TenQu has been implemented and evaluated with both simulators and the IBM-Q platform. Compared to state-of-the-art approaches, co-TenQu enhances a classical deep neural network by up to 41.72% in a fair setting. Additionally, it outperforms other quantum-based methods by up to 1.9 times and achieves similar accuracy while utilizing 70.59% fewer qubits.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15333'&gt;arXiv:2402.15333&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 23 Feb 2024 14:09:41 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Haruki Shimizu, Atsushi Ueda&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; In this study, we explore the geometric construction of the Klein bottle and the real projective plane ($\mathrm{RP}^2$) within the framework of tensor networks, focusing on the implementation of crosscap and rainbow boundaries. Previous investigations have applied boundary matrix product state (BMPS) techniques to study these boundaries. We introduce a novel approach that incorporates such boundaries into the tensor renormalization group (TRG) methodology, facilitated by an efficient representation of a spatial reflection operator. This advancement enables us to compute the crosscap and rainbow free energy terms and the one-point function on $\mathrm{RP}^2$ with enhanced efficiency and for larger system sizes. Additionally, our method is capable of calculating the partition function under isotropic conditions of space and imaginary time. The versatility of this approach is further underscored by its applicability to constructing other (non-)orientable surfaces of higher genus.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15507'&gt;arXiv:2402.15507&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 23 Feb 2024 18:56:31 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>The topology of data hides in quantum thermal states</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15633</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Stefano Scali, Chukwudubem Umeano, Oleksandr Kyriienko&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We provide a quantum protocol to perform topological data analysis (TDA) via the distillation of quantum thermal states. Recent developments of quantum thermal state preparation algorithms reveal their characteristic scaling defined by properties of dissipative Lindbladians. This contrasts with protocols based on unitary evolution which have a scaling depending on the properties of the combinatorial Laplacian. To leverage quantum thermal state preparation algorithms, we translate quantum TDA from a real-time to an imaginary-time picture, shifting the paradigm from a unitary approach to a dissipative one. Starting from an initial state overlapping with the ground state of the system, one can dissipate its energy via channels unique to the dataset, naturally distilling its information. Therefore calculating Betti numbers translates into a purity estimation. Alternatively, this can be interpreted as the evaluation of the R\'{e}nyi 2-entropy, Uhlmann fidelity or Hilbert-Schmidt distance relative to thermal states with the embedded topology of simplicial complexes. Our work opens the field of TDA toward a more physical interpretation of the topology of data.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15633'&gt;arXiv:2402.15633&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 23 Feb 2024 22:34:26 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Phase diagram of the one dimensional $t_1-t_2-J$ model: Ferromagnetism, triplet pairing, charge and pair density waves</title>

Feiguin&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We present a density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) study of an extended $t-J$ model with hopping to the first and second neighbors -- the one dimensional $t_1-t_2-J$ model. The full phase diagram as a function of the density $n$ and exchange strength $J$, for both positive and negative values of $t_2$, is obtained. For $t_2=-0.5$ we observe that, in the strongly interacting region, Nagaoka Ferromagnetism (FM) is accompanied by a triplet pair density wave (PDW) upon doping. As the spin exchange $J$ increases, a charge density wave (CDW) phase emerges and then gives way to singlet superconductivity (SC). This phase behaves as a singlet PDW with vanishing spacial average of the order parameter and a spin gap. When $t_2=0.5$, the physics is basically reminiscent of the conventional $t-J$ model, undergoing a transition from a metallic to a SC phase as a function of $J$.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15927'&gt;arXiv:2402.15927&lt;/a&gt;] Published Sat, 24 Feb 2024 23:10:55 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

While quantum algorithms for option pricing have been proposed, it is desired to devise more efficient implementations of costly operations in the algorithms, one of which is preparing a quantum state that encodes a probability distribution of the underlying asset price. In particular, in pricing a path-dependent option, we need to generate a state encoding a joint distribution of the underlying asset price at multiple time points, which is more demanding. To address these issues, we propose a novel approach using Matrix Product State (MPS) as a generative model for time series generation. To validate our approach, taking the Heston model as a target, we conduct numerical experiments to generate time series in the model. Our findings demonstrate the capability of the MPS model to generate paths in the Heston model, highlighting its potential for path-dependent option pricing on quantum computers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17148'&gt;arXiv:2402.17148&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 27 Feb 2024 02:29:24 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Bound-state confinement after trap-expansion dynamics in integrable systems</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17623</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Leonardo Biagetti, Vincenzo Alba&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Integrable systems possess stable families of quasiparticles, which are composite objects (bound states) of elementary excitations. Motivated by recent quantum computer experiments, we investigate bound-state transport in the spin-$1/2$ anisotropic Heisenberg chain ($XXZ$ chain). Specifically, we consider the sudden vacuum expansion of a finite region $A$ prepared in a non-equilibrium state. In the hydrodynamic regime, if interactions are strong enough, bound states remain confined in the initial region. Bound-state confinement persists until the density of unbound excitations remains finite in the bulk of $A$. Since region $A$ is finite, at asymptotically long times bound states are "liberated" after the "evaporation" of all the unbound excitations. Fingerprints of confinement are visible in the space-time profiles of local spin-projection operators. To be specific, here we focus on the expansion of the $p$-Néel states, which are obtained by repetition of a unit cell with $p$ up spins followed by $p$ down spins. Upon increasing $p$, the bound-state content is enhanced. In the limit $p\to\infty$ one obtains the domain-wall initial state. We show that for $p&lt;4$, only bound states with $n&gt;p$ are confined at large chain anisotropy. For $p\gtrsim 4$, also bound states with $n=p$ are confined, consistent with the absence of transport in the limit $p\to\infty$. The scenario of bound-state confinement leads to a hierarchy of timescales at which bound states of different sizes are liberated, which is also reflected in the dynamics of the von Neumann entropy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17623'&gt;arXiv:2402.17623&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 27 Feb 2024 15:50:19 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Demonstration of Robust and Efficient Quantum Property Learning with Shallow Shadows</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17911</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Hong-Ye Hu, Andi Gu, Swarnadeep Majumder, Hang Ren, Yipei Zhang, Derek S. Wang, Yi-Zhuang You, Zlatko Minev, Susanne F. Yelin, Alireza Seif&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Extracting information efficiently from quantum systems is a major component of quantum information processing tasks. Randomized measurements, or classical shadows, enable predicting many properties of arbitrary quantum states using few measurements. While random single-qubit measurements are experimentally friendly and suitable for learning low-weight Pauli observables, they perform poorly for nonlocal observables. Prepending a shallow random quantum circuit before measurements maintains this experimental friendliness, but also has favorable sample complexities for observables beyond low-weight Paulis, including high-weight Paulis and global low-rank properties such as fidelity. However, in realistic scenarios, quantum noise accumulated with each additional layer of the shallow circuit biases the results. To address these challenges, we propose the \emph{robust shallow shadows protocol}. Our protocol uses Bayesian inference to learn the experimentally relevant noise model and mitigate it in postprocessing. This mitigation introduces a bias-variance trade-off: correcting for noise-induced bias comes at the cost of a larger estimator variance. Despite this increased variance, as we demonstrate on a superconducting quantum processor, our protocol correctly recovers state properties such as expectation values, fidelity, and entanglement entropy, while maintaining a lower sample complexity compared to the random single qubit measurement scheme. We also theoretically analyze the effects of noise on sample complexity and show how the optimal choice of the shallow shadow depth varies with noise strength. This combined theoretical and experimental analysis positions the robust shallow shadow protocol as a scalable, robust, and sample-efficient protocol for characterizing quantum states on current quantum computing platforms.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17911'&gt;arXiv:2402.17911&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 27 Feb 2024 21:53:32 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Tensor Network Space-Time Spectral Collocation Method for Time Dependent Convection-Diffusion-Reaction Equations</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18073</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Dibyendu Adak, Duc P. Truong, Gianmarco Manzini, Kim Ø. Rasmussen, Boian S. Alexandrov&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Emerging tensor network techniques for solutions of Partial Differential Equations (PDEs), known for their ability to break the curse of dimensionality, deliver new mathematical methods for ultrafast numerical solutions of high-dimensional problems. Here, we introduce a Tensor Train (TT) Chebyshev spectral collocation method, in both space and time, for solution of the time dependent convection-diffusion-reaction (CDR) equation with inhomogeneous boundary conditions, in Cartesian geometry. Previous methods for numerical solution of time dependent PDEs often use finite difference for time, and a spectral scheme for the spatial dimensions, which leads to slow linear convergence. Spectral collocation space-time methods show exponential convergence, however, for realistic problems they need to solve large four-dimensional systems. We overcome this difficulty by using a TT approach as its complexity only grows linearly with the number of dimensions. We show that our TT space-time Chebyshev spectral collocation method converges exponentially, when the solution of the CDR is smooth, and demonstrate that it leads to very high compression of linear operators from terabytes to kilobytes in TT-format, and tens of thousands times speedup when compared to full grid space-time spectral method. These advantages allow us to obtain the solutions at much higher resolutions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18073'&gt;arXiv:2402.18073&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 28 Feb 2024 06:03:48 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Lindblad dynamics from spatio-temporal correlation functions in nonintegrable spin-1/2 chains with different boundary conditions</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18177</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Markus Kraft, Jonas Richter, Fengping Jin, Sourav Nandy, Jacek Herbrych, Kristel Michielsen, Hans De Raedt, Jochen Gemmer, Robin Steinigeweg&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We investigate the Lindblad equation in the context of boundary-driven magnetization transport in spin-$1/2$ chains. Our central question is whether the nonequilibrium steady state of the open system, including its buildup in time, can be described on the basis of the dynamics in the closed system. To this end, we rely on a previous work [Phys. Rev. B 108, L201119 (2023)], where a description in terms of spatio-temporal correlation functions has been suggested in the case of weak driving and small system-bath coupling. Because this work has focused on integrable systems and periodic boundary conditions, we here extend the analysis in three directions: We (i) consider nonintegrable systems, (ii) take into account open boundary conditions and other bath-coupling geometries, and (iii) provide a comparison to time-evolving block decimation. While we find that nonintegrability plays a minor role, the choice of the specific boundary conditions can be crucial, due to potentially nondecaying edge modes. Our large-scale numerical simulations suggest that a description based on closed-system correlation functions is an useful alternative to already existing state-of-the-art approaches.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18177'&gt;arXiv:2402.18177&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 28 Feb 2024 09:07:59 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Extracting the Luttinger parameter from a single wave function</title>

We demonstrate that this parameter can be extracted from a single wave function for one-component TLLs with periodic boundary condition. This method relies on the fact that TLLs are described by conformal field theory in which crosscap states can be constructed. The overlaps between the crosscap states and the ground state as well as some excited states are proved to be universal numbers that directly reveal the Luttinger parameter. In microscopic lattice models, crosscap states are formed by putting each pair of antipodal sites into a maximally entangled state. Analytical and numerical calculations are performed in a few representative models to substantiate the conformal field theory prediction. The extracted Luttinger parameters are generally quite accurate in finite-size systems with moderate lengths, so there is no need to perform data fitting and/or finite-size scaling.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18364'&gt;arXiv:2402.18364&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 28 Feb 2024 14:35:24 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

We use them in an out-of-equilibrium scenario, much less explored so far, by simulating the real-time collisions of composite mesons in the lattice Schwinger model. Constructing wave-packets of vector mesons at different incoming momenta, we observe the opening of the inelastic channel in which two heavier mesons are produced and identify the momentum threshold. To detect the products of the collision in the strong coupling regime we propose local quantitites that could be measured in current quantum simulation platforms.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18429'&gt;arXiv:2402.18429&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 28 Feb 2024 15:55:37 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Conditional Independence of 1D Gibbs States with Applications to Efficient Learning</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18500</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Álvaro M. Alhambra, Ángela Capel, Paul Gondolf, Alberto Ruiz-de-Alarcón, Samuel O. Scalet&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We show that spin chains in thermal equilibrium have a correlation structure in which individual regions are strongly correlated at most with their near vicinity. We quantify this with alternative notions of the conditional mutual information, defined through the so-called Belavkin-Staszewski relative entropy. We prove that these measures decay superexponentially at every positive temperature, under the assumption that the spin chain Hamiltonian is translation-invariant. Using a recovery map associated with these measures, we sequentially construct tensor network approximations in terms of marginals of small (sublogarithmic) size. As a main application, we show that classical representations of the states can be learned efficiently from local measurements with a polynomial sample complexity. We also prove an approximate factorization condition for the purity of the entire Gibbs state, which implies that it can be efficiently estimated to a small multiplicative error from a small number of local measurements. The results extend from strictly local to exponentially-decaying interactions above a threshold temperature, albeit only with exponential decay rates. As a technical step of independent interest, we show an upper bound to the decay of the Belavkin-Staszewski relative entropy upon the application of a conditional expectation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18500'&gt;arXiv:2402.18500&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 28 Feb 2024 17:28:01 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Collocation methods for nonlinear differential equations on low-rank manifolds</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18721</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Alec Dektor&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We introduce new methods for integrating nonlinear differential equations on low-rank manifolds. These methods rely on interpolatory projections onto the tangent space, enabling low-rank time integration of vector fields that can be evaluated entry-wise. A key advantage of our approach is that it does not require the vector field to exhibit low-rank structure, thereby overcoming significant limitations of traditional dynamical low-rank methods based on orthogonal projection. To construct the interpolatory projectors, we develop a sparse tensor sampling algorithm based on the discrete empirical interpolation method (DEIM) that parameterizes tensor train manifolds and their tangent spaces with cross interpolation. Using these projectors, we propose two time integration schemes on low-rank tensor train manifolds. The first scheme integrates the solution at selected interpolation indices and constructs the solution with cross interpolation. The second scheme generalizes the well-known orthogonal projector-splitting integrator to interpolatory projectors. We demonstrate the proposed methods with applications to several tensor differential equations arising from the discretization of partial differential equations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18721'&gt;arXiv:2402.18721&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 28 Feb 2024 21:44:58 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

We also study electromagnetic transitions and show the advantage of the VS-DMRG to capture the underlying physics more efficiently, with significantly improved convergence compared to state-of-the-art shell-model truncations. Combined with an analysis of quantum information measures, this further establishes the VS-DMRG as a valuable method for ab initio calculations of nuclei.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18723'&gt;arXiv:2402.18723&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 28 Feb 2024 21:46:42 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Samuel O. Scalet&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We consider the problem of approximating the free energy density of a translation-invariant, one-dimensional quantum spin system with finite range. While the complexity of this problem is nontrivial due to its close connection to problems with known hardness results, a classical subpolynomial-time algorithm has recently been proposed [Fawzi et al., 2022]. Combining several algorithmic techniques previously used for related problems, we propose an algorithm outperforming this result asymptotically and give rigorous bounds on its runtime. Our main techniques are the use of Araki expansionals, known from results on the nonexistence of phase transitions, and a matrix product operator construction. We also review a related approach using the Quantum Belief Propagation [Kuwahara et al., 2018], which in combination with our findings yields an equivalent result.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19030'&gt;arXiv:2402.19030&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 29 Feb 2024 10:42:18 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Structural Stability Hypothesis of Dual Unitary Quantum Chaos</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Jonathon Riddell, Curt von Keyserlingk, Tomaž Prosen, Bruno Bertini&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Having spectral correlations that, over small enough energy scales, are described by random matrix theory is regarded as the most general defining feature of quantum chaotic systems as it applies in the many-body setting and away from any semiclassical limit. Although this property is extremely difficult to prove analytically for generic many-body systems, a rigorous proof has been achieved for dual-unitary circuits -- a special class of local quantum circuits that remain unitary upon swapping space and time. Here we consider the fate of this property when moving from dual-unitary to generic quantum circuits focussing on the \emph{spectral form factor}, i.e., the Fourier transform of the two-point correlation. We begin with a numerical survey that, in agreement with previous studies, suggests that there exists a finite region in parameter space where dual-unitary physics is stable and spectral correlations are still described by random matrix theory, although up to a maximal quasienergy scale. To explain these findings, we develop a perturbative expansion: it recovers the random matrix theory predictions, provided the terms occurring in perturbation theory obey a relatively simple set of assumptions. We then provide numerical evidence and a heuristic analytical argument supporting these assumptions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19096'&gt;arXiv:2402.19096&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 29 Feb 2024 12:25:29 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Magnon spectrum of altermagnets beyond linear spin wave theory: Magnon-magnon interactions via time-dependent matrix product states vs. atomistic spin dynamics</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19433</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Federico Garcia-Gaitan, Ali Kefayati, John Q. Xiao, Branislav K. Nikolic&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The energy-momentum dispersion of magnons, as collective low-energy excitations of magnetic material, is computed from an effective quantum spin Hamiltonian but simplified via linearized Holstein-Primakoff transformations to describe noninteracting magnons. The dispersion produced by such linear spin wave theory (LSWT) is then plotted as ``sharp bands'' of infinitely long-lived quasiparticles. However, magnons are prone to many-body interactions with other quasiparticles -- such as electrons, phonons or other magnons -- which can lead to shifting (i.e., band renormalization) and broadening of ``sharp bands'' as the signature of finite quasiparticle lifetime. The magnon-magnon interactions can be particularly important in antiferromagnets (AFs), and, therefore, possibly in newly classified altermagnets sharing many features of collinear AFs. Here, we employ nonperturbative quantum many-body calculations, via time-dependent matrix product states (TDMPS), to obtain magnon spectral function for RuO$_2$ altermagnet whose effective quantum spin Hamiltonian is put onto 4-leg cylinder. Its upper band is shifted away from upper ``sharp band'' of LSWT, as well as broadened, which is explained as the consequence of {\em hybridization} of the latter with three-magnon continuum. This implies that two-magnon Raman scattering spectra {\em cannot} be computed from LSWT bands, which offers a litmus test for the relevance of magnon-magnon interactions. Finally, we employ atomistic spin dynamics (ASD) simulations, based on classical Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation, to obtain magnon spectrum at finite temperature and/or at a fraction of the cost of TDMPS calculations. Despite including magnon-magnon interactions via nonlinearity of LLG equation, ASD simulations {\em cannot} match the TDMPS-computed magnon spectrum, thereby signaling {\em nonclassical} effects harbored by AFs and altermagnets.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19433'&gt;arXiv:2402.19433&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 29 Feb 2024 18:32:44 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

In particular, the triangular antiferromagnet and Villain model in a transverse field can be understood through distinct XY pseudospins, but have qualitatively similar phase diagrams including a quantum phase transition in the (2+1)-dimensional XY universality class. While the quantum dynamics of modestly-sized systems can be simulated classically using tensor-based methods, these methods become infeasible for larger lattices. Here we perform both classical and quantum simulations of these dynamics, where our quantum simulator is a superconducting quantum annealer. Our observations on the triangular lattice suggest that the dominant quench dynamics are not described by the quantum Kibble-Zurek scaling of the quantum phase transition, but rather a faster coarsening dynamics in an effective two-dimensional XY model in the ordered phase. Similarly, on the Villain model, the scaling exponent does not match the Kibble-Zurek expectation. These results demonstrate the ability of quantum annealers to simulate coherent quantum dynamics and scale beyond the reach of classical approaches.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00091'&gt;arXiv:2403.00091&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 29 Feb 2024 19:39:14 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Enabling large-depth simulation of noisy quantum circuits with positive tensor networks</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00152</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Ambroise Müller, Thomas Ayral, Corentin Bertrand&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Matrix product density operators (MPDOs) are tensor network representations of locally purified density matrices where each physical degree of freedom is associated to an environment degree of freedom. MPDOs have interesting properties for mixed state representations: guaranteed positivity by construction, efficient conservation of the trace and computation of local observables. However, they have been challenging to use for noisy quantum circuit simulation, as the application of noise increases the dimension of the environment Hilbert space, leading to an exponential growth of bond dimensions. MPDOs also lack a unique canonical form, due to the freedom in the choice of basis for the environment Hilbert space, which leads to a vast variation of bond dimensions. In this work, we present a systematic way to reduce the bond dimensions of MPDOs by disentangling the purified state. We optimize the basis for the environment Hilbert space by performing density matrix renormalization group (DMRG)-like sweeps of local 2-qubit basis optimization. Interestingly, we find that targeting only the disentanglement of the purified state leads to a reduction of the environment dimension. In other words, a compact MPDO representation requires a low-entanglement purified state. We apply our compression method to the emulation of noisy random quantum circuits. Our technique allows us to keep bounded bond dimensions, and thus bounded memory, contrary to previous works on MPDOs, while keeping reasonable truncation fidelities.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00152'&gt;arXiv:2403.00152&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 29 Feb 2024 22:09:17 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Comment on "Controlled Bond Expansion for Density Matrix Renormalization Group Ground State Search at Single-Site Costs" (Extended Version)</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00562</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Ian P McCulloch, Jesse J Osborne&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; In a recent Letter [Phys. Rev. Lett. 130, 246402 (2023)], Gleis, Li, and von Delft present an algorithm for expanding the bond dimension of a Matrix Product State wave function, giving accuracy similar to 2-site DMRG, but computationally more efficient, closer to the performance of 1-site DMRG. The Controlled Bond Expansion (CBE) algorithm uses the Hamiltonian projected onto two sites, and then further projected onto the two-site tangent space, to extract a set of $k$ vectors that are used to expand the basis between the two sites. CBE achieves this with a complicated sequence of five singular value decompositions (SVDs), in order to project onto the 2-site tangent space and reduce the bond dimension of the tensor network such that the contraction can be done in time $O(dwD^3)$. In this Comment, we show that (1) the projection onto the 2-site tangent space is unnecessary, and is generally not helpful; (2) the sequence of 5 SVDs can be replaced by a single $QR$ decomposition (optionally with one SVD as well), making use of the randomized SVD (RSVD) with high accuracy and significantly improved efficiency, scaling as $O(dwkD^2)$ i.e., the most expensive operations are only quadratic in the bond dimension $D$ and linear in the number of expansion vectors $k$; (3) several statements about the variational properties of the CBE algorithm are incorrect, and the variational properties are essentially identical to existing algorithms including 2-site DMRG and single-site subspace expansion (3S); (4) a similar RSVD approach can be applied to the 3S algorithm, which leads to many advantages over CBE, especially in systems with long range interactions. We also make some comments on the benchmarking MPS algorithms, and the overall computational efficiency with respect to the accuracy of the calculation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00562'&gt;arXiv:2403.00562&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 01 Mar 2024 14:41:40 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Chiral Spin Liquid on a Shastry-Sutherland Heisenberg Antiferromagnet</title>

Wang, Bo Yang, Pinaki Sengupta&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We demonstrate the existence of a topological chiral spin liquid in the frustrated Shastry-Sutherland Heisenberg model with an additional spin chirality interaction, using numerically unbiased exact diagonalization and density matrix renormalization group methods. We establish a quantum phase diagram where conventional phases, including dimer singlet, plaquette singlet, N{\' e}el and collinear phase, can be clearly identified by suitable local order parameters. Among them a $SU(2)_1$ chiral spin liquid emerges in the highly frustrated region, which is unambiguously identified by two topologically degenerate ground states, modular matrix, and characteristic level counting in entanglement spectrum, featuring the same topological order of $\nu=1/2$ bosonic Laughlin state. The phase boundaries among the different orders are determined by the energy level crossing analysis and wave function fidelity susceptibility.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00597'&gt;arXiv:2403.00597&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 01 Mar 2024 15:19:46 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

However, establishing this capability, especially for impactful and meaningful problems, remains a central challenge. Here, we show that superconducting quantum annealing processors can rapidly generate samples in close agreement with solutions of the Schrödinger equation. We demonstrate area-law scaling of entanglement in the model quench dynamics of two-, three-, and infinite-dimensional spin glasses, supporting the observed stretched-exponential scaling of effort for matrix-product-state approaches. We show that several leading approximate methods based on tensor networks and neural networks cannot achieve the same accuracy as the quantum annealer within a reasonable time frame. Thus, quantum annealers can answer questions of practical importance that may remain out of reach for classical computation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00910'&gt;arXiv:2403.00910&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 01 Mar 2024 19:00:04 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Simulating chiral spin liquids with fermionic Projected Entangled Paired States</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01243</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Sasank Budaraju, Didier Poilblanc, Sen Niu&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Chiral Spin Liquids (CSL) based on spin-1/2 fermionic Projected Entangled Pair States (fPEPS) are considered on the square lattice. First, fPEPS approximants of Gutzwiller-projected Chern insulators (GPCI) are investigated by Variational Monte Carlo (VMC) techniques on finite size tori. We show that such fPEPS of finite bond dimension can correctly capture the topological properties of the chiral spin liquid, as the exact GPCI, with the correct topological ground state degeneracy on the torus. Further, more general fPEPS are considered and optimized (on the infinite plane) to describe the CSL phase of a chiral frustrated Heisenberg antiferromagnet. The chiral modes are computed on the edge of a semi-infinite cylinder (of finite circumference) and shown to follow the predictions from Conformal Field Theory. In contrast to their bosonic analogs the (optimized) fPEPS do not suffer from the replication of the chiral edge mode in the odd topological sector.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01243'&gt;arXiv:2403.01243&lt;/a&gt;] Published Sat, 02 Mar 2024 16:10:12 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Torus algebra and logical operators at low energy</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01577</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Ying Chan, Tian Lan, Linqian Wu&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Given a modular tensor category $\mathscr{C}$, we construct an associative algebra $\mathrm{Tor({\mathscr{C}}})$, which we call the torus algebra. We prove that the torus algebra is semisimple by explicitly constructing all the simple modules. Suppose that a topological ordered phase described by $\mathscr{C}$ is put on a torus. Physically, each simple module over $\mathrm{Tor({\mathscr{C}}})$ consists of the low energy states on the torus with one anyon excitation, or equivalently, the ground states on a punctured torus where the anyon is enclosed by the puncture. Elements in $\mathrm{Tor({\mathscr{C}}})$ can be physically interpreted as anyon hopping processes on the torus. We give the precise formula how an arbitrary logical operator on the low energy states on a torus can be realized by moving anyons on the torus. Our work thus provides a theoretical proposal that the low energy states on a torus can serve as topological qudits and one can arbitrarily manipulate them by moving anyons around.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01577'&gt;arXiv:2403.01577&lt;/a&gt;] Published Sun, 03 Mar 2024 17:54:23 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Computing exact moments of local random quantum circuits via tensor networks</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01706</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Paolo Braccia, Pablo Bermejo, Lukasz Cincio, M. Cerezo&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; A basic primitive in quantum information is the computation of the moments $\mathbb{E}_U[{\rm Tr}[U\rho U^\dagger O]^t]$. These describe the distribution of expectation values obtained by sending a state $\rho$ through a random unitary $U$, sampled from some distribution, and measuring the observable $O$. While the exact calculation of these moments is generally hard, if $U$ is composed of local random gates, one can estimate $\mathbb{E}_U[{\rm Tr}[U\rho U^\dagger O]^t]$ by performing Monte Carlo simulations of a Markov chain-like process. However, this approach can require a prohibitively large number of samples, or suffer from the sign problem. In this work, we instead propose to estimate the moments via tensor networks, where the local gates moment operators are mapped to small dimensional tensors acting on their local commutant bases. By leveraging representation theoretical tools, we study the local tensor dimension and we provide bounds for the bond dimension of the matrix product states arising from deep circuits. We compare our techniques against Monte Carlo simulations, showing that we can significantly out-perform them. Then, we showcase how tensor networks can exactly compute the second moment when $U$ is a quantum neural network acting on thousands of qubits and having thousands of gates. To finish, we numerically study the anticoncentration phenomena of circuits with orthogonal random gates, a task which cannot be studied via Monte Carlo due to sign problems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01706'&gt;arXiv:2403.01706&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 04 Mar 2024 03:50:31 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Recursive Quantum Relaxation for Combinatorial Optimization Problems</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02045</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Ruho Kondo, Yuki Sato, Rudy Raymond, Naoki Yamamoto&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Quantum optimization methods use a continuous degree-of-freedom of quantum states to heuristically solve combinatorial problems, such as the MAX-CUT problem, which can be attributed to various NP-hard combinatorial problems. This paper shows that some existing quantum optimization methods can be unified into a solver to find the binary solution which is most likely measured from the optimal quantum state. Combining this finding with the concept of quantum random access codes (QRACs) for encoding bits into quantum states on fewer qubits, we propose an efficient recursive quantum relaxation method called recursive quantum random access optimization (RQRAO) for MAX-CUT. Experiments on standard benchmark graphs with several hundred nodes in the MAX-CUT problem, conducted in a fully classical manner using a tensor network technique, show that RQRAO not only outperforms the Goemans-Williamson and recursive QAOA methods, but also is comparable to state-of-the-art classical solvers. The code is available at \url{https://github.com/ToyotaCRDL/rqrao}.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02045'&gt;arXiv:2403.02045&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 04 Mar 2024 13:48:21 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Federated Learning Using Coupled Tensor Train Decomposition</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02898</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Xiangtao Zhang, Eleftherios Kofidis, Ce Zhu, Le Zhang, Yipeng Liu&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Coupled tensor decomposition (CTD) can extract joint features from multimodal data in various applications. It can be employed for federated learning networks with data confidentiality. Federated CTD achieves data privacy protection by sharing common features and keeping individual features. However, traditional CTD schemes based on canonical polyadic decomposition (CPD) may suffer from low computational efficiency and heavy communication costs. Inspired by the efficient tensor train decomposition, we propose a coupled tensor train (CTT) decomposition for federated learning. The distributed coupled multi-way data are decomposed into a series of tensor trains with shared factors. In this way, we can extract common features of coupled modes while maintaining the different features of uncoupled modes. Thus the privacy preservation of information across different network nodes can be ensured. The proposed CTT approach is instantiated for two fundamental network structures, namely master-slave and decentralized networks. Experimental results on synthetic and real datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed schemes over existing methods in terms of both computational efficiency and communication rounds. In a classification task, experimental results show that the CTT-based federated learning achieves almost the same accuracy performance as that of the centralized counterpart.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02898'&gt;arXiv:2403.02898&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 05 Mar 2024 12:06:32 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Charge-order melting in the one-dimensional Edwards model</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03108</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Florian Lange, Gerhard Wellein, Holger Fehske&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We use infinite matrix-product-state techniques to study the time evolution of the charge-density-wave (CDW) order after a quench or a light pulse in a fundamental fermion-boson model. The motion of fermions in the model is linked to the creation of bosonic excitations, which counteracts the melting of the CDW order. For low-energy quenches corresponding to a change of the boson relaxation rate, we find behavior similar to that in an effective $t$-$V$ model. When the boson energy is quenched instead or a light pulse is applied to the system, the transient dynamics are more complex, with the CDW order first quickly decreasing to an intermediate value while the density-wave-like order of the bosons rises. In the case of pulse irradiation, the subsequent time-evolution of the CDW order depends strongly on the photon frequency. For frequencies slightly below the boson energy, we observe a temporary increase of the CDW order parameter. Our results reveal the complex physics of driven Mott insulators in low-dimensional systems with strong correlations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03108'&gt;arXiv:2403.03108&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 05 Mar 2024 16:51:59 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Deriving the non-perturbative gravitational dual of quantum Liouville theory from BCFT operator algebra</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03179</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Lin Chen, Ling-Yan Hung, Yikun Jiang, Bing-Xin Lao&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We demonstrate that, by utilizing the boundary conformal field theory (BCFT) operator algebra of the Liouville CFT, one can express its path-integral on any Riemann surface as a three dimensional path-integral with appropriate boundary conditions, generalising the recipe for rational CFTs \cite{Hung:2019bnq, Brehm:2021wev, Chen:2022wvy, Cheng:2023kxh}. This serves as a constructive method for deriving the \textit{quantum} holographic dual of the CFT, which reduces to Einstein gravity in the large central charge limit. As a byproduct, the framework provides an explicit discrete state-sum of a 3D non-chiral topological theory constructed from quantum $6j$ symbols of $\mathcal{U}_q(sl(2,\mathbb{R}))$ with non-trivial boundary conditions, representing a long-sought non-perturbative discrete formulation of 3D pure gravity with negative cosmological constant, at least within a class of three manifolds. This constitutes the first example of an exact holographic tensor network that reproduces a known irrational CFT with a precise quantum gravitational interpretation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03179'&gt;arXiv:2403.03179&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 05 Mar 2024 18:16:49 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Operator Learning Renormalization Group</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Xiu-Zhe Luo, Di Luo, Roger G. Melko&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; In this paper, we present a general framework for quantum many-body simulations called the operator learning renormalization group (OLRG). Inspired by machine learning perspectives, OLRG is a generalization of Wilson's numerical renormalization group and White's density matrix renormalization group, which recursively builds a simulatable system to approximate a target system of the same number of sites via operator maps. OLRG uses a loss function to minimize the error of a target property directly by learning the operator map in lieu of a state ansatz. This loss function is designed by a scaling consistency condition that also provides a provable bound for real-time evolution. We implement two versions of the operator maps for classical and quantum simulations. The former, which we call the Operator Matrix Map, can be implemented via neural networks on classical computers. The latter, which we call the Hamiltonian Expression Map, generates device pulse sequences to leverage the capabilities of quantum computing hardware. We illustrate the performance of both maps for calculating time-dependent quantities in the quantum Ising model Hamiltonian.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03199'&gt;arXiv:2403.03199&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 05 Mar 2024 18:37:37 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

As a second application, we determine a single expression for the rate function in the large deviation principle for the height function in the fan and in the shock region.

Zuehlsdorff&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Nonadiabatic couplings between several electronic excited states are ubiquitous in many organic chromophores and can significantly influence optical properties. A recent experimental study demonstrated that the proflavine molecule exhibits surprising dual fluorescence in the gas phase, that is suppressed in polar solvent environments. Here, we uncover the origin of this phenomenon by parameterizing a linear-vibronic coupling (LVC) Hamiltonian from spectral densities of system-bath coupling constructed along molecular dynamics trajectories, fully accounting for interactions with the condensed-phase environment. The finite-temperature absorption, steady-stat emission, and time-resolved emission spectra are then computed using powerful, numerically exact tensor network approaches. We find that the dual fluorescence in vacuum is driven by a single well-defined coupling mode, but is quenched in solution due to dynamic solvent-driven symmetry-breaking that mixes the two low-lying electronic states. We expect the computational framework developed here to be widely applicable to the study of non-Condon effects in complex condensed-phase environments.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03316'&gt;arXiv:2403.03316&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 05 Mar 2024 20:43:07 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Non-thermal eigenstates and slow relaxation in quantum Fredkin spin chains</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03986</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Luke Causer, Mari Carmen Bañuls, Juan P. Garrahan&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We study the dynamics and thermalization of the Fredkin spin chain, a system with local three-body interactions, particle conservation and explicit kinetic constraints. We consider deformations away from its stochastic point in order to tune between regimes where kinetic energy dominates and those where potential energy does. By means of exact diagonalisation, perturbation theory and variational matrix product states, we show there is a sudden change of behaviour in the dynamics that occurs, from one of fast thermalization to one of slow metastable (prethermal) dynamics near the stochastic point. This change in relaxation is connected to the emergence of additional kinetic constraints which lead to the fragmentation of Hilbert space in the limit of a large potential energy. We also show that this change can lead to thermalization being evaded for special initial conditions due to non-thermal eigenstates (akin to quantum many-body scars). We provide clear evidence for the existence of these non-thermal states for large system sizes even when far from the large-potential-energy limit, and explain their connection to the emergent kinetic constraints.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03986'&gt;arXiv:2403.03986&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 06 Mar 2024 19:00:16 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Phonon state tomography of electron correlation dynamics in optically excited solids</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04209</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Mattia Moroder, Matteo Mitrano, Ulrich Schollwöck, Sebastian Paeckel, John Sous&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We introduce phonon state tomography (PST) as a diagnostic probe of electron dynamics in solids whose phonons are optically excited by a laser pulse at initial time. Using a projected-purified matrix-product states algorithm, PST decomposes the exact correlated electron-phonon wavefunction into contributions from purely electronic states corresponding to statistically typical configurations of the optically accessible phononic response, enabling a 'tomographic' reconstruction of the electronic dynamics generated by the phonons. Thus, PST may be used to diagnose electronic behavior in experiments that access only the phonon response, such as thermal diffuse x-ray and electron scattering. We study the dynamics of a metal whose infrared phonons are excited by an optical pulse at initial time and use it to simulate the sample-averaged momentum-resolved phonon occupancy and accurately reconstruct the electronic correlations. We also use PST to analyze the influence of different pulse shapes on the light-induced enhancement and suppression of electronic correlations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04209'&gt;arXiv:2403.04209&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 07 Mar 2024 04:26:45 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Weak Hopf symmetry and tube algebra of the generalized multifusion string-net model</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04446</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Zhian Jia, Sheng Tan, Dagomir Kaszlikowski&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We investigate the multifusion generalization of string-net ground states and lattice Hamiltonians, delving into its associated weak Hopf symmetry. For the multifusion string-net, the gauge symmetry manifests as a general weak Hopf algebra, leading to a reducible vacuum string label; the charge symmetry, serving as a quantum double of gauge symmetry, constitutes a connected weak Hopf algebra. This implies that the associated topological phase retains its characterization by a unitary modular tensor category (UMTC). The bulk charge symmetry can also be captured by a weak Hopf tube algebra. We offer an explicit construction of the weak Hopf tube algebra structure and thoroughly discuss its properties. The gapped boundary and domain wall models are extensively discussed, with these $1d$ phases characterized by unitary multifusion categories (UMFCs). We delve into the gauge and charge symmetries of these $1d$ phases, as well as the construction of the boundary and domain wall tube algebras. Additionally, we illustrate that the domain wall tube algebra can be regarded as a cross product of two boundary tube algebras. As an application of our model, we elucidate how to interpret the defective string-net as a restricted multifusion string-net.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04446'&gt;arXiv:2403.04446&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 07 Mar 2024 12:27:43 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Robust teleportation of a surface code and cascade of topological quantum phase transitions</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04767</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Finn Eckstein, Bo Han, Simon Trebst, Guo-Yi Zhu&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Teleportation is a facet where quantum measurements can act as a powerful resource in quantum physics, as local measurements allow to steer quantum information in a non-local way. While this has long been established for a single Bell pair, the teleportation of a many-qubit entangled state using non-maximally entangled resources presents a fundamentally different challenge. Here we investigate a tangible protocol for teleporting a long-range entangled surface code state using elementary Bell measurements and its stability in the presence of coherent errors that weaken the Bell entanglement. We relate the underlying threshold problem to the physics of anyon condensation under weak measurements and map it to a variant of the Ashkin-Teller model of statistical mechanics with Nishimori type disorder, which gives rise to a cascade of phase transitions. Tuning the angle of the local Bell measurements, we find a continuously varying threshold. Notably, the threshold moves to infinity for the $X+Z$ angle along the self-dual line -- indicating that infinitesimally weak entanglement is sufficient in teleporting a self-dual topological surface code. Our teleportation protocol, which can be readily implemented in dynamically configurable Rydberg atom arrays, thereby gives guidance for a practical demonstration of the power of quantum measurements.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04767'&gt;arXiv:2403.04767&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 07 Mar 2024 18:59:56 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Quantum criticality under imperfect teleportation</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04843</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Pablo Sala, Sara Murciano, Yue Liu, Jason Alicea&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Entanglement, measurement, and classical communication together enable teleportation of quantum states between distant parties, in principle with perfect fidelity. To what extent do correlations and entanglement of a many-body wavefunction transfer under imperfect teleportation protocols? We address this question for the case of an imperfectly teleported quantum critical wavefunction, focusing on the ground state of a critical Ising chain. We demonstrate that imperfections, e.g., in the entangling gate adopted for a given protocol, effectively manifest as weak measurements acting on the otherwise pristinely teleported critical state. Armed with this perspective, we leverage and further develop the theory of measurement-altered quantum criticality to quantify the resilience of critical-state teleportation. We identify classes of teleportation protocols for which imperfection $(i)$ preserves both the universal long-range entanglement and correlations of the original quantum critical state, $(ii)$ weakly modifies these quantities away from their universal values, and $(iii)$ obliterates long-range entanglement altogether while preserving power-law correlations, albeit with a new set of exponents. We also show that mixed states describing the average over a series of sequential imperfect teleportation events retain pristine power-law correlations due to a `built-in' decoding algorithm, though their entanglement structure measured by the negativity depends on errors similarly to individual protocol runs. These results may allow one to design teleportation protocols that optimize against errors -- highlighting a potential practical application of measurement-altered criticality.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04843'&gt;arXiv:2403.04843&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 07 Mar 2024 19:00:08 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

The method is applied to study the performance of the optimal adaptive metrological protocols in presence of various noise types, including correlated noise.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04854'&gt;arXiv:2403.04854&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 07 Mar 2024 19:08:05 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Tensor approximation of functional differential equations</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Abram Rodgers, Daniele Venturi&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Functional Differential Equations (FDEs) play a fundamental role in many areas of mathematical physics, including fluid dynamics (Hopf characteristic functional equation), quantum field theory (Schwinger-Dyson equation), and statistical physics. Despite their significance, computing solutions to FDEs remains a longstanding challenge in mathematical physics. In this paper we address this challenge by introducing new approximation theory and high-performance computational algorithms designed for solving FDEs on tensor manifolds. Our approach involves approximating FDEs using high-dimensional partial differential equations (PDEs), and then solving such high-dimensional PDEs on a low-rank tensor manifold leveraging high-performance parallel tensor algorithms. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated through its application to the Burgers-Hopf FDE, which governs the characteristic functional of the stochastic solution to the Burgers equation evolving from a random initial state.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04946'&gt;arXiv:2403.04946&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 07 Mar 2024 23:22:07 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

We present here a variational approach to substantially alleviate this problem in many situations of interest. Our approach is based on the time-dependent Variational Monte Carlo method, in conjunction with a correlated and time-dependent Jastrow ansatz. We demonstrate that accurate results can be obtained in a variety of problems, ranging from the description of defect generation through a dynamical phase transition in 1D to the complex dynamics of frustrated spin-glass problems both on fully-connected and Chimera graphs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05147'&gt;arXiv:2403.05147&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 08 Mar 2024 08:31:48 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Spin-1/2 string correlations and singlet-triplet gaps of frustrated ladders with ferromagnetic (F) legs and alternate F and AF rungs</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05238</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Monalisa Chatterjee, Manoranjan Kumar, Zoltán G. Soos&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The frustrated ladder with alternate ferromagnetic(F) exchange $-J_F$ and AF exchange $J_A$ to first neighbors and F exchange $-J_L$ to second neighbors is studied by exact diagonalization (ED) and density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) calculations in systems of $2N$ spins-1/2 with periodic boundary conditions. The ground state is a singlet $(S = 0)$ and the singlet-triplet gap $\varepsilon_T$ is finite for the exchanges considered. Spin-1/2 string correlation functions $g_1(N)$ and $g_2(N)$ are defined for an even number $N$ of consecutive spins in systems with two spins per unit cell; the ladder has string order $g_2(\infty)&gt; 0$ and $g_1(\infty) = 0$. The minimum $N^*$ of $g_2(N)$ is related to the range of ground-state spin correlations. Convergence to $g_2(\infty)$ is from below, and $g_1(N)$ decreases exponentially for $N \geq N^*$. Singlet valence bond (VB) diagrams account for the size dependencies. The frustrated ladder at special values of $J_F$, $J_L$ and $J_A$ reduces to well-known models such as the spin-1 Heisenberg antiferromagnet and the $J_1-J_2$ model, among others. Numerical analysis of ladders matches previous results for spin-1 gaps or string correlation functions and extends them to spin-1/2 systems. The nondegenerate singlet ground state of ladder is a bond-order wave, a Kekulé VB diagrams at $J_L = J_F/2 \leq J_A$, that is reversed on interchanging $-J_F$ and $J_A$. Inversion symmetry is spontaneously broken in the dimer phase of the $J_1-J_2$ model where the Kekulé diagrams are the doubly degenerate ground states at $J_2/J_1 = 1/2$.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05238'&gt;arXiv:2403.05238&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 08 Mar 2024 11:59:01 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Multi-GPU-Enabled Hybrid Quantum-Classical Workflow in Quantum-HPC Middleware: Applications in Quantum Simulations</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05828</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Kuan-Cheng Chen, Xiaoren Li, Xiaotian Xu, Yun-Yuan Wang, Chen-Yu Liu&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Achieving high-performance computation on quantum systems presents a formidable challenge that necessitates bridging the capabilities between quantum hardware and classical computing resources. This study introduces an innovative distribution-aware Quantum-Classical-Quantum (QCQ) architecture, which integrates cutting-edge quantum software framework works with high-performance classical computing resources to address challenges in quantum simulation for materials and condensed matter physics. At the heart of this architecture is the seamless integration of VQE algorithms running on QPUs for efficient quantum state preparation, Tensor Network states, and QCNNs for classifying quantum states on classical hardware. For benchmarking quantum simulators, the QCQ architecture utilizes the cuQuantum SDK to leverage multi-GPU acceleration, integrated with PennyLane's Lightning plugin, demonstrating up to tenfold increases in computational speed for complex phase transition classification tasks compared to traditional CPU-based methods. This significant acceleration enables models such as the transverse field Ising and XXZ systems to accurately predict phase transitions with a 99.5% accuracy. The architecture's ability to distribute computation between QPUs and classical resources addresses critical bottlenecks in Quantum-HPC, paving the way for scalable quantum simulation. The QCQ framework embodies a synergistic combination of quantum algorithms, machine learning, and Quantum-HPC capabilities, enhancing its potential to provide transformative insights into the behavior of quantum systems across different scales. As quantum hardware continues to improve, this hybrid distribution-aware framework will play a crucial role in realizing the full potential of quantum computing by seamlessly integrating distributed quantum resources with the state-of-the-art classical computing infrastructure.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05828'&gt;arXiv:2403.05828&lt;/a&gt;] Published Sat, 09 Mar 2024 07:38:45 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Entanglement and logarithmic spirals in a quantum spin-1 many-body system with competing dimer and trimer interactions</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06825</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Huan-Qiang Zhou, Qian-Qian Shi, Ian P. McCulloch, Murray T. Batchelor&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) with type-B Goldstone modes is investigated in the macroscopically degenerate phase for a quantum spin-1 many-body system with competing dimer and trimer interactions. The SSB involves three distinct patterns. The first occurs at the dimer point, with the pattern from staggered ${\rm SU}(3)$ to ${\rm U}(1)\times{\rm U}(1)$. The second occurs at the trimer point, with the pattern from uniform ${\rm SU}(3)$ to ${\rm U}(1)\times{\rm U}(1)$. The third occurs in the dimer-trimer regime, with the pattern from uniform ${\rm SU}(2)$ to ${\rm U}(1)$. The number of type-B Goldstone modes is thus two, two and one for the three patterns, respectively. The ground state degeneracies arising from the three patterns are exponential with the system size, which may be recognized as sequences of integers relevant to self-similar logarithmic spirals. This in turn is attributed to the presence of an emergent symmetry operation tailored to a specific degenerate ground state. As a consequence, the residual entropy is non-zero, which measures the disorder present in a unit cell of highly degenerate ground state generated from a generalized highest weight state. An exact Schmidt decomposition exists for the highly degenerate ground states, thus exposing the self-similarities underlying an abstract fractal, described by the fractal dimension. The latter is extracted from performing a universal finite system-size scaling analysis of the entanglement entropy, which is identical to the number of type-B Goldstone modes. The model under investigation thus accommodates an exotic scale invariant quantum state of matter.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06825'&gt;arXiv:2403.06825&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 11 Mar 2024 15:42:19 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Application of Quantum Tensor Networks for Protein Classification</title>

We classify proteins based on their subcellular locations, a pivotal task in bioinformatics that is key to understanding biological processes and disease mechanisms. Leveraging the quantum-enhanced processing capabilities, we demonstrate that Quantum Tensor Networks (QTN) can effectively handle the complexity and diversity of protein sequences. We present a detailed methodology that adapts QTN architectures to the nuanced requirements of protein data, supported by comprehensive experimental results. We demonstrate two distinct QTNs, inspired by classical recurrent neural networks (RNN) and convolutional neural networks (CNN), to solve the binary classification task mentioned above. Our top-performing quantum model has achieved a 94% accuracy rate, which is comparable to the performance of a classical model that uses the ESM2 protein language model embeddings. It's noteworthy that the ESM2 model is extremely large, containing 8 million parameters in its smallest configuration, whereas our best quantum model requires only around 800 parameters. We demonstrate that these hybrid models exhibit promising performance, showcasing their potential to compete with classical models of similar complexity.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06890'&gt;arXiv:2403.06890&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 11 Mar 2024 16:47:09 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Gravitational back-reaction is magical</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; ChunJun Cao, Gong Cheng, Alioscia Hamma, Lorenzo Leone, William Munizzi, Savatore F. E. Oliviero&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We study the interplay between magic and entanglement in quantum many-body systems. We show that non-local magic, which is supported by the quantum correlations is lower bounded by the non-flatness of entanglement spectrum and upper bounded by the amount of entanglement in the system. We then argue that a smoothed version of non-local magic bounds the hardness of classical simulations for incompressible states. In conformal field theories, we conjecture that the non-local magic should scale linearly with entanglement entropy but sublinearly when an approximation of the state is allowed. We support the conjectures using both analytical arguments based on unitary distillation and numerical data from an Ising CFT. If the CFT has a holographic dual, then we prove that the non-local magic vanishes if and only if there is no gravitational back-reaction. Furthermore, we show that non-local magic is approximately equal to the rate of change of the minimal surface area in response to the change of cosmic brane tension in the bulk.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07056'&gt;arXiv:2403.07056&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 11 Mar 2024 18:00:03 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Piotr Sierant, Maciej Lewenstein, Antonello Scardicchio, Lev Vidmar, Jakub Zakrzewski&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Statistical mechanics provides a framework for describing the physics of large, complex many-body systems using only a few macroscopic parameters to determine the state of the system. For isolated quantum many-body systems, such a description is achieved via the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH), which links thermalization, ergodicity and quantum chaotic behavior. However, tendency towards thermalization is not observed at finite system sizes and evolution times in a robust many-body localization (MBL) regime found numerically and experimentally in the dynamics of interacting many-body systems at strong disorder. Although the phenomenology of the MBL regime is well-established, the central question remains unanswered: under what conditions does the MBL regime give rise to an MBL phase in which the thermalization does not occur even in the asymptotic limit of infinite system size and evolution time? This review focuses on recent numerical investigations aiming to clarify the status of the MBL phase, and it establishes the critical open questions about the dynamics of disordered many-body systems. Persistent finite size drifts towards ergodicity consistently emerge in spectral properties of disordered many-body systems, excluding naive single-parameter scaling hypothesis and preventing comprehension of the status of the MBL phase. The drifts are related to tendencies towards thermalization and non-vanishing transport observed in the dynamics of many-body systems, even at strong disorder. These phenomena impede understanding of microscopic processes at the ETH-MBL crossover. Nevertheless, the abrupt slowdown of dynamics with increasing disorder strength suggests the proximity of the MBL phase. This review concludes that the questions about thermalization and its failure in disordered many-body systems remain a captivating area open for further explorations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07111'&gt;arXiv:2403.07111&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 11 Mar 2024 19:00:06 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Emergent (2+1)D topological orders from iterative (1+1)D gauging</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07575</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Jose Garre Rubio&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Gauging introduces gauge fields in order to localize an existing global symmetry, resulting in a dual global symmetry on the gauge fields that can be gauged again. By iterating the gauging process on spin chains with Abelian group symmetries and arranging the gauge fields in a 2D lattice, the local symmetries become the stabilizer of the $XZZX$-code for any Abelian group. By twisting the gauging map we obtain new codes that explicitly confine anyons, which violate an odd number of plaquette terms and whose fusion results in mobile dipole excitations. Our construction naturally realizes any gapped boundary by taking different quantum phases of the initial (1+1)D globally symmetric system. Our method establishes a new route to obtain higher dimensional topological codes from lower ones, to identify their gapped boundaries and their tensor network representations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07575'&gt;arXiv:2403.07575&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 12 Mar 2024 12:04:58 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Fine-tuning Neural Network Quantum States</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07795</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Riccardo Rende, Sebastian Goldt, Federico Becca, Luciano Loris Viteritti&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Recent progress in the design and optimization of neural-network quantum states (NQSs) has made them an effective method to investigate ground-state properties of quantum many-body systems. In contrast to the standard approach of training a separate NQS from scratch at every point of the phase diagram, we demonstrate that the optimization of a NQS at a highly expressive point of the phase diagram (i.e., close to a phase transition) yields features that can be reused to accurately describe a wide region across the transition. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach on different systems in one and two dimensions by initially pretraining a NQS at a given point of the phase diagram, followed by fine-tuning only the output layer for all other points. Notably, the computational cost of the fine-tuning step is very low compared to the pretraining stage. We argue that the reduced cost of this paradigm has significant potential to advance the exploration of strongly-correlated systems using NQS, mirroring the success of fine-tuning in machine learning and natural language processing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07795'&gt;arXiv:2403.07795&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 12 Mar 2024 16:33:32 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Chiral spin state and nematic ferromagnet in the spin-1 Kitaev-$Γ$ model</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08382</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Qiang Luo, Jize Zhao, Jinbin Li, Xiaoqun Wang&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The higher-spin Kitaev magnets, in which the Kitaev interaction and off-diagonal exchange couplings are overwhelmingly large, have emerged as a fertile avenue to explore exotic phases and unusual excitations. In this work, we study the quantum phase diagram of the spin-1 Kitaev-$\Gamma$ model on the honeycomb lattice using density-matrix renormalization group. It harbours six distinct phases and the intriguing findings are three magnetically ordered phases in which both time-reversal symmetry and lattice symmetry albeit of different sort are broken spontaneously. The chiral spin state originates from the order-by-disorder effect and exhibits an almost saturated scalar spin chirality at the quantum level. Depending on the relative strength of the two interactions, it also features columnar-like or plaquette-like dimer pattern as a consequence of the translational symmetry breaking. In parallel, the nematic ferromagnets are situated at ferromagnetic Kitaev side and possess small but finite ferromagnetic ordering. The lattice-rotational symmetry breaking enforces nonequivalent bond energy along one of the three bonds. Although the intrinsic difference between the two nematic ferromagnets remains elusive, the discontinuities in the von Neumann entropy, hexagonal plaquette operator, and Wilson loop operator convincingly suggest that they are separated via a first-order phase transition.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08382'&gt;arXiv:2403.08382&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 13 Mar 2024 09:47:14 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Optimal adaptation of surface-code decoders to local noise</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08706</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Andrew S. Darmawan&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Information obtained from noise characterization of a quantum device can be used in classical decoding algorithms to improve the performance of quantum error-correcting codes. Focusing on the surface code under local (i.e. single-qubit) noise, we present a simple method to determine the maximum extent to which adapting a surface-code decoder to a noise feature can lead to a performance improvement. Our method is based on a tensor-network decoding algorithm, which uses the syndrome information as well as a process matrix description of the noise to compute a near-optimal correction. By selectively mischaracterizing the noise model input to the decoder and measuring the resulting loss in fidelity of the logical qubit, we can determine the relative importance of individual noise parameters for decoding. We apply this method to several physically relevant uncorrelated noise models with features such as coherence, spatial inhomogeneity and bias. While noise generally requires many parameters to describe completely, we find that to achieve near optimal decoding it appears only necessary adapt the decoder to a small number of critical parameters.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08706'&gt;arXiv:2403.08706&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 13 Mar 2024 17:12:33 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Stabilizer Tensor Networks: universal quantum simulator on a basis of stabilizer states</title>

This is the case for methods such as tensor networks, based on entanglement, and the tableau formalism, which represents stabilizer states. In this work, we integrate these two approaches to present a generalization of the tableau formalism used for Clifford circuit simulation. We explicitly prove how to update our formalism with Clifford gates, non-Clifford gates, and measurements, enabling universal circuit simulation. We also discuss how the framework allows for efficient simulation of more states, raising some interesting questions on the representation power of tensor networks and the quantum properties of resources such as entanglement and magic, and support our claims with simulations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08724'&gt;arXiv:2403.08724&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 13 Mar 2024 17:23:09 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Quantum Many-Body Scarring in $2+1$D Gauge Theories with Dynamical Matter</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08858</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Jesse Osborne, Ian P. McCulloch, Jad C. Halimeh&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Quantum many-body scarring (QMBS) has emerged as an intriguing paradigm of weak ergodicity breaking in nonintegrable quantum many-body models, particularly lattice gauge theories (LGTs) in $1+1$ spacetime dimensions. However, an open question is whether QMBS exists in higher-dimensional LGTs with dynamical matter. Given that nonergodic dynamics in $d{=}1$ spatial dimension tend to vanish in $d{&gt;}1$, it is important to probe this question. Using matrix product state techniques for both finite and infinite systems, we show that QMBS occurs in the $2{+}1$D $\mathrm{U}(1)$ quantum link model (QLM), as evidenced in persistent coherent oscillations in local observables, a marked slowdown in the growth of the bipartite entanglement entropy, and revivals in the fidelity. Interestingly, we see that QMBS is more robust when the matter degrees of freedom are bosonic rather than fermionic. Our results further shed light on the intimate connection between gauge invariance and QMBS, and highlight the persistence of scarring in higher spatial dimensions. Our findings can be tested in near-term analog and digital quantum simulators, and we demonstrate their accessibility on a recently proposed cold-atom analog quantum simulator.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08858'&gt;arXiv:2403.08858&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 13 Mar 2024 18:00:01 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Compactness of quantics tensor train representations of local imaginary-time propagators</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09161</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Haruto Takahashi, Rihito Sakurai, Hiroshi Shinaoka&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Space-time dependence of imaginary-time propagators, vital for \textit{ab initio} and many-body calculations based on quantum field theories, has been revealed to be compressible using Quantum Tensor Trains (QTTs) [Phys. Rev. X {\bf 13}, 021015 (2023)]. However, the impact of system parameters, like temperature, on data size remains underexplored. This paper provides a comprehensive numerical analysis of the compactness of local imaginary-time propagators in QTT for one-time/-frequency objects and two-time/-frequency objects, considering truncation in terms of the Frobenius and maximum norms. To study worst-case scenarios, we employ random pole models, where the number of poles grows logarithmically with the inverse temperature and coefficients are random. The Green's functions generated by these models are expected to be more difficult to compress than those from physical systems. The numerical analysis reveals that these propagators are highly compressible in QTT, outperforming the state-of-the-art approaches such as intermediate representation and discrete Lehmann representation. For one-time/-frequency objects and two-time/-frequency objects, the bond dimensions saturate at low temperatures, especially for truncation in terms of the Frobenius norm. We provide counting-number arguments for the saturation of bond dimensions for the one-time/-frequency objects, while the origin of this saturation for two-time/-frequency objects remains to be clarified. This paper's findings highlight the critical need for further research on the selection of truncation methods, tolerance levels, and the choice between imaginary-time and imaginary-frequency representations in practical applications.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09161'&gt;arXiv:2403.09161&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 14 Mar 2024 08:17:53 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Tyler Franke, Thomas Quella&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We revisit the question of string order and hidden symmetry breaking in the q-deformed AKLT model, an example of a spin chain that possesses generalized symmetry. We first argue that the non-local Kennedy-Tasaki duality transformation that was previously proposed to relate the string order to a local order parameter leads to a non-local Hamiltonian and thus does not provide a physically adequate description of the symmetry breaking. We then present a modified non-local transformation which is based on a recently developed generalization of Witten's Conjugation to frustration-free lattice models and capable of resolving this issue.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09287'&gt;arXiv:2403.09287&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 14 Mar 2024 11:18:32 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Exact matrix product state representations for a type of scale-invariant states</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09458</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Huan-Qiang Zhou, Qian-Qian Shi, Ian P. McCulloch&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Exact matrix product state representations for a type of scale-invariant states are presented, which describe highly degenerate ground states arising from spontaneous symmetry breaking with type-B Goldstone modes in one-dimensional quantum many-body systems. As a possible application, such a representation offers a convenient but powerful means for evaluating the norms of highly degenerate ground states. This in turn allows us to perform a universal finite system-size scaling analysis of the entanglement entropy. Moreover, this approach vividly explains why the entanglement entropy does not depend on what types of the boundary conditions are adopted, either periodic boundary conditions or open boundary conditions. Illustrative examples include the ${\rm SU}(2)$ spin-$s$ Heisenberg ferromagnetic model, the ${\rm SU}(2s+1)$ ferromagnetic model, and the staggered ${\rm SU}(3)$ spin-1 ferromagnetic biquadratic model.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09458'&gt;arXiv:2403.09458&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 14 Mar 2024 15:00:46 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Efficient tensor networks for control-enhanced quantum metrology</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Qiushi Liu, Yuxiang Yang&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Optimized quantum control can enhance the performance and noise resilience of quantum metrology. However, the optimization quickly becomes intractable when multiple control operations are applied sequentially. In this work, we propose efficient tensor network algorithms for optimizing strategies of quantum metrology enhanced by a long sequence of control operations. Our approach covers a general and practical scenario where the experimenter applies $N-1$ interleaved control operations between $N$ queries of the channel to estimate and uses no or bounded ancilla. Tailored to different experimental capabilities, these control operations can be generic quantum channels or variational unitary gates. Numerical experiments show that our algorithm has a good performance in optimizing the metrological strategy for as many as $N=100$ queries. In particular, our algorithm identifies a strategy that can outperform the state-of-the-art strategy when $N$ is finite but large.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09519'&gt;arXiv:2403.09519&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 14 Mar 2024 16:02:27 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>SO(n) AKLT Chains as Symmetry Protected Topological Quantum Ground States</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09951</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Michael Ragone&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; This thesis studies a pair of symmetry protected topological (SPT) phases which arise when considering one-dimensional quantum spin systems possessing a natural orthogonal group symmetry. Particular attention is given to a family of exactly solvable models whose ground states admit a matrix product state description and generalize the AKLT chain. We call these models ``$SO(n)$ AKLT chains'' and the phase they occupy the ``$SO(n)$ Haldane phase''. We present new results describing their ground state structure and, when $n$ is even, their peculiar $O(n)$-to-$SO(n)$ symmetry breaking. We also prove that these states have arbitrarily large correlation and injectivity length by increasing $n$, but all have a 2-local parent Hamiltonian, in contrast to the natural expectation that the interaction range of a parent Hamiltonian should diverge as these quantities diverge. We extend Ogata's definition of an SPT index for a split state for a finite symmetry group $G$ to an SPT index for a compact Lie group $G$. We then compute this index, which takes values in the second Borel group cohomology $H^2(SO(n),U(1))$, at a single point in each of the SPT phases. The two points have different indices, confirming the two SPT phases are indeed distinct. Chapter 1 contains an introduction with a detailed overview of the contents of this thesis, which includes several chapters of background information before presenting new results in Chapter 7 and Chapter 8.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09951'&gt;arXiv:2403.09951&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 15 Mar 2024 01:22:49 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Atsushi Iwaki, Chisa Hotta&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; For quantum many-body systems in one dimension, computational complexity theory reveals that the evaluation of ground-state energy remains elusive on quantum computers, contrasting the existence of a classical algorithm for temperatures higher than the inverse logarithm of the system size. This highlights a qualitative difference between low- and high-temperature states in terms of computational complexity. Here, we describe finite-temperature states using the matrix product state formalism. Within the framework of random samplings, we derive an analytical formula for the required number of samples, which provides both quantitative and qualitative measures of computational complexity. At high and low temperatures, its scaling behavior with system size is linear and quadratic, respectively, demonstrating a distinct crossover between these numerically difficult regimes of quantitative difference.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10018'&gt;arXiv:2403.10018&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 15 Mar 2024 04:52:52 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Inter-chain Interactions, Multi-magnon condensation and Strain effect in chain compound NaVOPO$_4$</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10025</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Manoj Gupta, Manodip Routh, Manoranjan Kumar, Tanusri Saha Dasgupta&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Employing first-principles modelling and many-body methods, the magnetic properties of spin-1/2 chain compound NaVOPO$_4$ are explored. The extensive first-principles calculations establish an intricate three-dimensionally coupled model that consists of weakly alternating $J$-$J^{\prime}$ antiferromagnetic chains running along cris-cross directions between two consecutive $ab$ planes, connected via two subleading couplings, a ferromagnetic exchange along the $c$ direction ($J_c$) and a weaker antiferromagnetic exchange ($J_a$) along the body diagonal direction. The exact diagonalization and density matrix renormalized group study has been carried out on a two-dimensional spin model with $J$-$J^{\prime}$-$J_c$ and effective $J_d$ couplings, constructed based on the full model, for numerical ease. The $J_c$-$J_d$ phase diagram is found to host a {\it disorder} phase with a finite spin gap for comparable values of $J_c$ and $J_d$, arising out of the competing nature of these two interactions, other than two ordered phases. The calculated thermodynamic properties of this model provide a fair description of experimentally measured data. The predominant manifestation of $J_c$ and $J_d$ in the disorder phase happens in the stabilisation of a multi-magnon condensed phase, upon gap closing by application of an external magnetic field. We further explore the effect of tensile uniaxial strain, which is found to drive the system from gapful to gapless ground state.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10025'&gt;arXiv:2403.10025&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 15 Mar 2024 05:16:34 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Quantum Magnetic Skyrmion Operator</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Andreas Haller, Sebastián A. Díaz, Wolfgang Belzig, Thomas L. Schmidt&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We propose a variational wave function to represent quantum skyrmions as bosonic operators. The operator faithfully reproduces two fundamental features of quantum skyrmions: their classical magnetic order and a "quantum cloud" of local spin-flip excitations. Using exact numerical simulations of the ground states of a 2D chiral magnetic model, we find two regions in the single-skyrmion state diagram distinguished by their leading quantum corrections. We use matrix product state simulations of the adiabatic braiding of two skyrmions to verify that the operator representation of skyrmions is valid at large inter-skyrmion distances. Our work demonstrates that skyrmions can be approximately coarse-grained and represented by bosonic quasiparticles, which paves the way toward a field theory of many-skyrmion quantum phases and, unlike other approaches, incorporates the microscopic quantum fluctuations of individual skyrmions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10347'&gt;arXiv:2403.10347&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 15 Mar 2024 14:32:01 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Non-reciprocal dynamics and the non-Hermitian skin effect of repulsively bound pairs</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10449</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Pietro Brighi, Andreas Nunnenkamp&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We study the dynamics of a Bose-Hubbard model coupled to an engineered environment which in the non-interacting limit is described by the celebrated Hatano-Nelson model. At strong interactions, two bosons occupying the same site form a so-called repulsively bound pair, or doublon. Using tensor-network simulations, we clearly identify a distinct doublon lightcone and show that the doublon inherits non-reciprocity from that of single particles. Applying the idea of reservoir engineering at the level of doublons, we introduce a new set of dissipators and we analytically show that then the doublon dynamics are governed by the Hatano-Nelson model. This brings about an interaction-induced non-Hermitian skin effect and non-reciprocal doublon motion. Combining features of the two models we study, we show that single particles and doublons can be made to spread with opposite directionality, opening intriguing possibilities for the study of dynamics in interacting non-reciprocal models.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10449'&gt;arXiv:2403.10449&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 15 Mar 2024 16:32:15 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Tensor Star Tensor Decomposition and Its Applications to Higher-order Compression and Completion</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10481</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Wuyang Zhou, Yu-Bang Zheng, Qibin Zhao, Danilo Mandic&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; A novel tensor decomposition framework, termed Tensor Star (TS) decomposition, is proposed which represents a new type of tensor network decomposition based on tensor contractions. This is achieved by connecting the core tensors in a ring shape, whereby the core tensors act as skip connections between the factor tensors and allow for direct correlation characterisation between any two arbitrary dimensions. Uniquely, this makes it possible to decompose an order-$N$ tensor into $N$ order-$3$ factor tensors $\{\mathcal{G}_{k}\}_{k=1}^{N}$ and $N$ order-$4$ core tensors $\{\mathcal{C}_{k}\}_{k=1}^{N}$, which are arranged in a star shape. Unlike the class of Tensor Train (TT) decompositions, these factor tensors are not directly connected to one another. The so obtained core tensors also enable consecutive factor tensors to have different latent ranks. In this way, the TS decomposition alleviates the "curse of dimensionality" and controls the "curse of ranks", exhibiting a storage complexity which scales linearly with the number of dimensions and as the fourth power of the ranks.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10481'&gt;arXiv:2403.10481&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 15 Mar 2024 17:12:50 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Quantum phase transition between spin liquid and spin nematics in spin-1 Kitaev honeycomb model</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Tohru Mashiko, Tsuyoshi Okubo&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Besides the exactly solvable spin-1/2 Kitaev model, higher spin-$S$ ones, not exactly solvable, are promising playgrounds for researches on the quantum spin liquid as well. One of the main interests in higher spin-S cases is the interplay between the Kitaev spin liquid (KSL) and spin nematics. We probe this interplay in a spin-1 model on the honeycomb lattice with competing bilinear-biquadratic and Kitaev interactions. Utilizing the 2D infinite projected entangled-pair state (iPEPS), we map out the phase diagram for the ferro-biquadratic interaction. In the phase diagram, we discover the direct KSL--spin-nematics transitions in the vicinity of pure Kitaev limits. It has been revealed that the ferro KSL exhibits robustness against perturbations from ferro-quadrupolar interactions. Also, the spin-nematic phase is extended to the parameter region near the antiferro-Kitaev limit.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11490'&gt;arXiv:2403.11490&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 18 Mar 2024 05:48:15 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Entrywise tensor-train approximation of large tensors via random embeddings</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Stanislav Budzinskiy&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The theory of low-rank tensor-train approximation is well understood when the approximation error is measured in the Frobenius norm. The entrywise maximum norm is equally important but is significantly weaker for large tensors, making the estimates obtained via the Frobenius norm and norm equivalence pessimistic or even meaningless. In this article, we derive a direct estimate of the entrywise approximation error that is applicable in some of these cases. The estimate is given in terms of the higher-order generalization of the matrix factorization norm, and its proof is based on the tensor-structured Hanson--Wright inequality. The theoretical results are accompanied by numerical experiments carried out with the method of alternating projections.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11768'&gt;arXiv:2403.11768&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 18 Mar 2024 13:26:16 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Thermal Tensor Network Approach for Spin-Lattice Relaxation in Quantum Magnets</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11895</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Ning Xi, Yuan Gao, Chengchen Li, Shuang Liang, Rong Yu, Xiaoqun Wang, Wei Li&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Low-dimensional quantum magnets, particularly those with strong spin frustration, are characterized by their notable spin fluctuations. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) serves as a sensitive probe of low-energy fluctuations that offers valuable insight into rich magnetic phases and emergent phenomena in quantum magnets. Although experimentally accessible, the numerical simulation of NMR relaxation rates, specifically the spin-lattice relaxation rate $1/T_1$, remains a significant challenge. Analytical continuation based on Monte Carlo calculations are hampered by the notorious negative sign for frustrated systems, and the real-time simulations incur significant costs to capture low-energy fluctuations. Here we propose computing the relaxation rate using thermal tensor networks (TTNs), which provides a streamlined approach by calculating its imaginary-time proxy. We showcase the accuracy and versatility of our methodology by applying it to one-dimensional spin chains and two-dimensional lattices, where we find that the critical exponents $\eta$ and $z\nu$ can be extracted from the low-temperature scalings of the simulated $1/T_1$ near quantum critical points. Our results also provide insights into the low-dimensional and frustrated magnetic materials, elucidating universal scaling behaviors in the Ising chain compound CoNb$_2$O$_6$ and revealing the renormalized classical behaviors in the triangular-lattice antiferromagnet Ba$_8$CoNb$_6$O$_{24}$. We apply the approach to effective model of the family of frustrated magnets AYbCh$_2$ (A = Na, K, Cs, and Ch = O, S, Se), and find dramatic changes from spin ordered to the proposed quantum spin liquid phase. Overall, with high reliability and accuracy, the TTN methodology offers a systematic strategy for studying the intricate dynamics observed across a broad spectrum of quantum magnets and related fields.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11895'&gt;arXiv:2403.11895&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 18 Mar 2024 15:54:02 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Surface growth approach for bulk reconstruction in AdS/BCFT correspondence</title>

We show that the entanglement wedge with a boundary can be constructed from the direct growth of bulk extremal surfaces layer by layer. In addition, we find that the surface growth configuration in BCFT can be connected with the defect multi scale entanglement renormalization ansatz (MERA) tensor network. Furthermore, we also investigate the entanglement of purification within the surface growth process, which reveals more refined structure of entanglement entropy and indicates a selection rule for surface growth in the bulk reconstruction.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12086'&gt;arXiv:2403.12086&lt;/a&gt;] Published Sun, 10 Mar 2024 13:59:23 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Characterizing the Entanglement of Anyonic Systems using the Anyonic Partial Transpose</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12121</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Nico Kirchner, Wonjune Choi, Frank Pollmann&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Entanglement of mixed quantum states can be quantified using the partial transpose and its corresponding entanglement measure, the logarithmic negativity. Recently, the notion of partial transpose has been extended to systems of anyons, which are exotic quasiparticles whose exchange statistics go beyond the bosonic and fermionic case. Studying the fundamental properties of this anyonic partial transpose, we first reveal that when applied to the special case of fermionic systems, it can be reduced to the fermionic partial transpose or its twisted variant depending on whether or not a boundary Majorana fermion is present. Focusing on ground state properties, we find that the anyonic partial transpose captures both the correct entanglement scaling for gapless systems, as predicted by conformal field theory, and the phase transition between a topologically trivial and a nontrivial phase. For non-abelian anyons and the bipartition geometry, we find a rich multiplet structure in the eigenvalues of the partial transpose, the so-called negativity spectrum, and reveal the possibility of defining both a charge- and an imbalance-resolved negativity.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12121'&gt;arXiv:2403.12121&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 18 Mar 2024 18:00:00 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Fractionalization Signatures in the Dynamics of Quantum Spin Liquids</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Kang Wang, Shi Feng, Penghao Zhu, Runze Chi, Hai-Jun Liao, Nandini Trivedi, Tao Xiang&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We investigate the signatures of fractionalization in quantum spin liquids by studying different phases of the Kitaev honeycomb model in the presence of an out-of-plane magnetic field through which the model becomes non-integrable. Using the infinite projected entangled pair states (iPEPS) ansatz, along with analytical calculations and exact diagonalization, we calculate dynamical signatures of fractionalized particles through spin-spin and dimer-dimer correlations. Our analysis demonstrates the ability of these correlations to discern distinct fractionalized quantum sectors, namely Majorana fermions and the emergent $Z_2$ fluxes, in both the chiral spin liquid (CSL) phase under weak field and the emergent intermediate gapless phase (IGP) under moderate field. Importantly, our calculation reveals the nature of IGP observed at moderate fields, a region of ongoing debate, indicating that this phase is a Majorana metal induced by strong flux fluctuations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12141'&gt;arXiv:2403.12141&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 18 Mar 2024 18:00:20 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Fast and accurate nonadiabatic molecular dynamics enabled through variational interpolation of correlated electron wavefunctions</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12275</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Kemal Atalar, Yannic Rath, Rachel Crespo-Otero, George H. Booth&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We build on the concept of eigenvector continuation to develop an efficient multi-state method for the rigorous and smooth interpolation of a small training set of many-body wavefunctions through chemical space at mean-field cost. The inferred states are represented as variationally optimal linear combinations of the training states transferred between the many-body basis of different nuclear geometries. We show that analytic multi-state forces and nonadiabatic couplings from the model enable application to nonadiabatic molecular dynamics, developing an active learning scheme to ensure a compact and systematically improvable training set. This culminates in application to the nonadiabatic molecular dynamics of a photoexcited 28-atom hydrogen chain, with surprising complexity in the resulting nuclear motion. With just 22 DMRG calculations of training states from the low-energy correlated electronic structure at different geometries, we infer the multi-state energies, forces and nonadiabatic coupling vectors at 12,000 geometries with provable convergence to high accuracy along an ensemble of molecular trajectories, which would not be feasible with a brute force approach. This opens up a route to bridge the timescales between accurate single-point correlated electronic structure methods and timescales of relevance for photo-induced molecular dynamics.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12275'&gt;arXiv:2403.12275&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 18 Mar 2024 21:44:46 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Tangent space generators of matrix product states and exact Floquet quantum scars</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12325</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Marko Ljubotina, Elena Petrova, Norbert Schuch, Maksym Serbyn&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The advancement of quantum simulators motivates the development of a theoretical framework to assist with efficient state preparation in quantum many-body systems. Generally, preparing a target entangled state via unitary evolution with time-dependent couplings is a challenging task and very little is known about the existence of solutions and their properties. In this work we develop a constructive approach for preparing matrix product states (MPS) via continuous unitary evolution. We provide an explicit construction of the operator which exactly implements the evolution of a given MPS along a specified direction in its tangent space. This operator can be written as a sum of local terms of finite range, yet it is in general non-Hermitian. Relying on the explicit construction of the non-Hermitian generator of the dynamics, we demonstrate the existence of a Hermitian sequence of operators that implements the desired MPS evolution with the error which decreases exponentially with the operator range. The construction is benchmarked on an explicit periodic trajectory in a translationally invariant MPS manifold. We demonstrate that the Floquet unitary generating the dynamics over one period of the trajectory features an approximate MPS-like eigenstate embedded among a sea of thermalizing eigenstates. These results show that our construction is useful not only for state preparation and control of many-body systems, but also provides a generic route towards Floquet scars -- periodically driven models with quasi-local generators of dynamics that have exact MPS eigenstates in their spectrum.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12325'&gt;arXiv:2403.12325&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 18 Mar 2024 23:34:19 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Cross Interpolation for Solving High-Dimensional Dynamical Systems on Low-Rank Tucker and Tensor Train Manifolds</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12826</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Behzad Ghahremani, Hessam Babaee&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We present a novel tensor interpolation algorithm for the time integration of nonlinear tensor differential equations (TDEs) on the tensor train and Tucker tensor low-rank manifolds, which are the building blocks of many tensor network decompositions. This paper builds upon our previous work (Donello et al., Proceedings of the Royal Society A, Vol. 479, 2023) on solving nonlinear matrix differential equations on low-rank matrix manifolds using CUR decompositions. The methodology we present offers multiple advantages: (i) It delivers near-optimal computational savings both in terms of memory and floating-point operations by leveraging cross algorithms based on the discrete empirical interpolation method to strategically sample sparse entries of the time-discrete TDEs to advance the solution in low-rank form. (ii) Numerical demonstrations show that the time integration is robust in the presence of small singular values. (iii) High-order explicit Runge-Kutta time integration schemes are developed. (iv) The algorithm is easy to implement, as it requires the evaluation of the full-order model at strategically selected entries and does not use tangent space projections, whose efficient implementation is intrusive. We demonstrate the efficiency of the presented algorithm for several test cases, including a nonlinear 100-dimensional TDE for the evolution of a tensor of size $70^{100} \approx 3.2 \times 10^{184}$ and a stochastic advection-diffusion-reaction equation with a tensor of size $4.7 \times 10^9$.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12826'&gt;arXiv:2403.12826&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 19 Mar 2024 15:31:24 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

It is a distillation and continuation of the work done in (van der Poel, 2023). To do so, we will abstract the problem down to modeling Motzkin spin chains, which exhibit long-range correlations reminiscent of those found in language. The Matrix Product State (MPS), also known as the tensor train, has a bond dimension which scales as the length of the sequence it models. To combat this, we use the factored core MPS, whose bond dimension scales sub-linearly. We find that the tensor models reach near perfect classifying ability, and maintain a stable level of performance as the number of valid training examples is decreased.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12969'&gt;arXiv:2403.12969&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 09 Jan 2024 00:07:36 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Symmetry Protected Topological Phases of Mixed States in the Doubled Space</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13280</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Ruochen Ma, Alex Turzillo&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The interplay of symmetry and topology in quantum many-body mixed states has recently garnered significant interest. In a phenomenon not seen in pure states, mixed states can exhibit average symmetries -- symmetries that act on component states while leaving the ensemble invariant. In this work, we systematically characterize symmetry protected topological (SPT) phases of short-range entangled (SRE) mixed states of spin systems -- protected by both average and exact symmetries -- by studying their pure Choi states in a doubled Hilbert space, where the familiar notions and tools for SRE and SPT pure states apply. This advantage of the doubled space comes with a price: extra symmetries as well as subtleties around how hermiticity and positivity of the original density matrix constrain the possible SPT invariants. Nevertheless, the doubled space perspective allows us to obtain a systematic classification of mixed-state SPT (MSPT) phases. We also investigate the robustness of MSPT invariants under symmetric finite-depth quantum channels, the bulk-boundary correspondence for MSPT phases, and the consequences of the MSPT invariants for the separability of mixed states and the symmetry-protected sign problem. In addition to MSPT phases, we study the patterns of spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) of mixed states, including the phenomenon of exact-to-average SSB, and the order parameters that detect them. Mixed state SSB is related to an ingappability constraint on symmetric Lindbladian dynamics.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13280'&gt;arXiv:2403.13280&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 20 Mar 2024 03:40:28 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Tensor Quantum Programming</title>

Perelshtein&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Running quantum algorithms often involves implementing complex quantum circuits with such a large number of multi-qubit gates that the challenge of tackling practical applications appears daunting. To date, no experiments have successfully demonstrated a quantum advantage due to the ease with which the results can be adequately replicated on classical computers through the use of tensor network algorithms. Additionally, it remains unclear even in theory where exactly these advantages are rooted within quantum systems because the logarithmic complexity commonly associated with quantum algorithms is also present in algorithms based on tensor networks. In this article, we propose a novel approach called Tensor Quantum Programming, which leverages tensor networks for hybrid quantum computing. Our key insight is that the primary challenge of algorithms based on tensor networks lies in their high ranks (bond dimensions). Quantum computing offers a potential solution to this challenge, as an ideal quantum computer can represent tensors with arbitrarily high ranks in contrast to classical counterparts, which indicates the way towards quantum advantage. While tensor-based vector-encoding and state-readout are known procedures, the matrix-encoding required for performing matrix-vector multiplications directly on quantum devices remained unsolved. Here, we developed an algorithm that encodes Matrix Product Operators into quantum circuits with a depth that depends linearly on the number of qubits. It demonstrates effectiveness on up to 50 qubits for several matrices frequently encountered in differential equations, optimization problems, and quantum chemistry. We view this work as an initial stride towards the creation of genuinely practical quantum algorithms.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13486'&gt;arXiv:2403.13486&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 20 Mar 2024 10:44:00 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Scalability of quantum error mitigation techniques: from utility to advantage</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13542</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Sergey N. Filippov, Sabrina Maniscalco, Guillermo García-Pérez&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Error mitigation has elevated quantum computing to the scale of hundreds of qubits and tens of layers; however, yet larger scales (deeper circuits) are needed to fully exploit the potential of quantum computing to solve practical problems otherwise intractable. Here we demonstrate three key results that pave the way for the leap from quantum utility to quantum advantage: (1) we present a thorough derivation of random and systematic errors associated to the most advanced error mitigation strategies, including probabilistic error cancellation (PEC), zero noise extrapolation (ZNE) with probabilistic error amplification, and tensor-network error mitigation (TEM); (2) we prove that TEM (i) has the lowest sampling overhead among all three techniques under realistic noise, (ii) is optimal, in the sense that it saturates the universal lower cost bound for error mitigation, and (iii) is therefore the most promising approach to quantum advantage; (3) we propose a concrete notion of practical quantum advantage in terms of the universality of algorithms, stemming from the commercial need for a problem-independent quantum simulation device. We also establish a connection between error mitigation, relying on additional measurements, and error correction, relying on additional qubits, by demonstrating that TEM with a sufficient bond dimension works similarly to an error correcting code of distance 3. We foresee that the interplay and trade-off between the two resources will be the key to a smooth transition between error mitigation and error correction, and hence between near-term and fault-tolerant quantum computers. Meanwhile, we argue that quantum computing with optimal error mitigation, relying on modest classical computer power for tensor network contraction, has the potential to reach larger scales in accurate simulation than classical methods alone.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13542'&gt;arXiv:2403.13542&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 20 Mar 2024 12:26:51 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Phase diagram of generalized TASEP on an open chain: Liggett-like boundary conditions</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Nadezhda Zh Bunzarova, Nina C Pesheva, Alexander M Povolotsky&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The totally asymmetric simple exclusion process with generalized update is a version of the discrete time totally asymmetric exclusion process with an additional inter-particle interaction that controls the degree of particle clustering. Though the model was shown to be integrable on the ring and on the infinite lattice, on the open chain it was studied mainly numerically, while no analytic results existed even for its phase diagram. In this paper we introduce new boundary conditions associated with the infinite translation invariant stationary states of the model, which allow us to obtain the exact phase diagram analytically. We discuss the phase diagram in detail and confirm the analytic predictions by extensive numerical simulations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13670'&gt;arXiv:2403.13670&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 20 Mar 2024 15:29:04 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Tensor network compressibility of convolutional models</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14379</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Sukhbinder Singh, Saeed S. Jahromi, Roman Orus&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are one of the most widely used neural network architectures, showcasing state-of-the-art performance in computer vision tasks. Although larger CNNs generally exhibit higher accuracy, their size can be effectively reduced by ``tensorization'' while maintaining accuracy, namely, replacing the convolution kernels with compact decompositions such as Tucker, Canonical Polyadic decompositions, or quantum-inspired decompositions such as matrix product states, and directly training the factors in the decompositions to bias the learning towards low-rank decompositions. But why doesn't tensorization seem to impact the accuracy adversely? We explore this by assessing how \textit{truncating} the convolution kernels of \textit{dense} (untensorized) CNNs impact their accuracy. Specifically, we truncated the kernels of (i) a vanilla four-layer CNN and (ii) ResNet-50 pre-trained for image classification on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets. We found that kernels (especially those inside deeper layers) could often be truncated along several cuts resulting in significant loss in kernel norm but not in classification accuracy. This suggests that such ``correlation compression'' (underlying tensorization) is an intrinsic feature of how information is encoded in dense CNNs. We also found that aggressively truncated models could often recover the pre-truncation accuracy after only a few epochs of re-training, suggesting that compressing the internal correlations of convolution layers does not often transport the model to a worse minimum. Our results can be applied to tensorize and compress CNN models more effectively.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14379'&gt;arXiv:2403.14379&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 21 Mar 2024 13:12:33 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Entanglement Hamiltonian for inhomogeneous free fermions</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Riccarda Bonsignori, Viktor Eisler&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We study the entanglement Hamiltonian for the ground state of one-dimensional free fermions in the presence of an inhomogeneous chemical potential. In particular, we consider a lattice with a linear, as well as a continuum system with a quadratic potential. It is shown that, for both models, conformal field theory predicts a Bisognano-Wichmann form for the entangement Hamiltonian of a half-infinite system. Furthermore, despite being nonrelativistic, this result is inherited by our models in the form of operators that commute exactly with the entanglement Hamiltonian. After appropriate rescaling, they also yield an excellent approximation of the entanglement spectra, which becomes asymptotically exact in the bulk of the trapped Fermi gas. For the gradient chain, however, the conformal result is recovered only after taking a proper continuum limit.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14766'&gt;arXiv:2403.14766&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 21 Mar 2024 18:13:10 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Exact Hidden Markovian Dynamics in Quantum Circuits</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; He-Ran Wang, Xiao-Yang Yang, Zhong Wang&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Characterizing nonequilibrium dynamics in quantum many-body systems is a challenging frontier of physics. In this Letter, we systematically construct solvable nonintegrable quantum circuits that exhibit exact hidden Markovian subsystem dynamics. This feature thus enables accurately calculating local observables for arbitrary evolution time. Utilizing the influence matrix method, we show that the influence of the time-evolved global system on a finite subsystem can be analytically described by sequential, time-local quantum channels acting on the subsystem with an ancilla of finite Hilbert space dimension. The realization of exact hidden Markovian property is facilitated by a solvable condition on the underlying two-site gates in the quantum circuit. We further present several concrete examples with varying local Hilbert space dimensions to demonstrate our approach.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14807'&gt;arXiv:2403.14807&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 21 Mar 2024 19:42:21 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Quantum Fluctuations Suppress the Critical Fields in BaCo$_2$(AsO$_4$)$_2$</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15315</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Shiva Safari, William Bateman-Hemphill, Asimpunya Mitra, Félix Desrochers, Emily Z. Zhang, Lubuna Shafeek, Austin Ferrenti, Tyrel M. McQueen, Arkady Shekhter, Zoltán Köllö, Yong Baek Kim, B. J. Ramshaw, K. A. Modic&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Early efforts to realize exotic quantum ground states in frustrated magnets focused on frustration arising from the lattice geometry alone. Attention has shifted to bond-dependent anisotropic interactions, as well as further-neighbor interactions, on non-geometrically-frustrated lattices due to their greater versatility. The honeycomb magnet BaCo$_2$(AsO$_4$)$_2$ recently emerged as a candidate host for both bond-dependent (e.g. Kitaev) and third-neighbor ($J_3$) interactions, and has become a model experimental system due to its relatively low levels of disorder. Understanding the relative importance of different exchange interactions holds the key to achieving novel ground states, such as quantum spin liquids. Here, we use the magnetotropic susceptibility to map out the intermediate and high-field phase diagram of BaCo$_2$(AsO$_4$)$_2$ as a function of the out-of-plane magnetic field direction at $T = 1.6$ K. We show that the experimental data are qualitatively consistent with classical Monte Carlo results of the XXZ-$J_1$-$J_3$ model with small Kitaev and off-diagonal exchange couplings included. However, the calculated critical fields are systematically larger than the experimental values. Infinite-DMRG computations on the quantum model reveal that quantum corrections from a nearby ferromagnetic state are likely responsible for the suppressed critical fields. Together, our experiment and theory analyses demonstrate that, while quantum fluctuations play an important role in determining the phase diagram, most of the physics of BaCo$_2$(AsO$_4$)$_2$ can be understood in terms of the classical dynamics of long-range ordered states, leaving little room for the possibility of a quantum spin liquid.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15315'&gt;arXiv:2403.15315&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 22 Mar 2024 16:08:39 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Ferromagnetic Ising model on the hierarchical pentagon lattice</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Takumi Oshima, Tomotoshi Nishino&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Thermodynamic properties of the ferromagnetic Ising model on the hierarchical pentagon lattice is studied by means of the tensor network methods. The lattice consists of pentagons, where 3 or 4 of them meet at each vertex. Correlation functions on the surface of the system up to n = 10 layers are evaluated by means of the time evolving block decimation (TEBD) method, and the power low decay is observed in the high temperature region. The recursive structure of the lattice enables complemental numerical study for larger systems, by means of a variant of the corner transfer matrix renormalization group (CTMRG) method. Calculated spin expectation value shows that there is a mean-field type order-disorder transition at T1 = 1.58 on the surface of the system. On the other hand, the bulk part exhibits the transition at T2 = 2.269. Consistency of these calculated results is examined.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15829'&gt;arXiv:2403.15829&lt;/a&gt;] Published Sat, 23 Mar 2024 13:01:58 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Infinite Grassmann Time-Evolving Matrix Product Operator Method in the Steady State</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16700</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Chu Guo, Ruofan Chen&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We present an infinite Grassmann time-evolving matrix product operator method for quantum impurity problems, which directly works in the steady state. The method embraces the well-established infinite matrix product state algorithms with the recently developed GTEMPO method, and benefits from both sides: it obtains real-time Green's functions without sampling noises and bath discretization error, it is applicable for any temperature without the sign problem, its computational cost is independent of the transient dynamics and does not scale with the number of baths. We benchmark the method on the finite-temperature equilibrium Green's function in the noninteracting limit against exact solutions and in the single-orbital Anderson impurity model against GTEMPO calculations. We also study the zero-temperature non-equilibrium steady state of an impurity coupled to two baths with a voltage bias, obtaining consistent particle currents with existing calculations. The method is ideal for studying steady-state quantum transport, and can be readily used as an efficient real-time impurity solver in the dynamical mean field theory and its non-equilibrium extension.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16700'&gt;arXiv:2403.16700&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 25 Mar 2024 12:33:32 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Unveiling clean two-dimensional discrete time quasicrystals on a digital quantum computer</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16718</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Kazuya Shinjo, Kazuhiro Seki, Tomonori Shirakawa, Rong-Yang Sun, Seiji Yunoki&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; In periodically driven (Floquet) systems, evolution typically results in an infinite-temperature thermal state due to continuous energy absorption over time. However, before reaching thermal equilibrium, such systems may transiently pass through a meta-stable state known as a prethermal state. This prethermal state can exhibit phenomena not commonly observed in equilibrium, such as discrete time crystals (DTCs), making it an intriguing platform for exploring out-of-equilibrium dynamics. Here, we investigate the relaxation dynamics of initially prepared product states under periodic driving in a kicked Ising model using the IBM Quantum Heron processor, comprising 133 superconducting qubits arranged on a heavy-hexagonal lattice, over up to $100$ time steps. We identify the presence of a prethermal regime characterised by magnetisation measurements oscillating at twice the period of the Floquet cycle and demonstrate its robustness against perturbations to the transverse field. Our results provide evidence supporting the realisation of a period-doubling DTC in a two-dimensional system. Moreover, we discover that the longitudinal field induces additional amplitude modulations in the magnetisation with a period incommensurate with the driving period, leading to the emergence of discrete time quasicrystals (DTQCs). These observations are further validated through comparison with tensor-network and state-vector simulations. Our findings not only enhance our understanding of clean DTCs in two dimensions but also highlight the utility of digital quantum computers for simulating the dynamics of quantum many-body systems, addressing challenges faced by state-of-the-art classical simulations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16718'&gt;arXiv:2403.16718&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 25 Mar 2024 12:56:13 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Quantum State Preparation for Probability Distributions with Reflection Symmetry Using Matrix Product States</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Yuichi Sano, Ikko Hamamura&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Quantum circuits for loading probability distributions into quantum states are essential subroutines in quantum algorithms used in physics, finance engineering, and machine learning. The ability to implement these with high accuracy in low-depth quantum circuits is a critical issue. We propose a novel quantum state preparation method for probability distribution with reflection symmetry using matrix product states. By considering reflection symmetry, our method reduces the entanglement of probability distributions and improves the accuracy of approximations by matrix product states. As a result, we improved the accuracy by two orders of magnitude over existing methods using matrix product states. Our approach, characterized by linear scalability with qubit count, is highly advantageous for noisy quantum devices. Also, our demonstration results reveal that the approximation accuracy in tensor networks depends heavily on the bond dimension, with minimal reliance on the number of qubits. Our method is demonstrated for a normal distribution encoded into 10 and 20 qubits on a real quantum processor.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16729'&gt;arXiv:2403.16729&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 25 Mar 2024 13:03:35 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

The circuits are demonstrated as applied to simulations of molecular docking based on holographic Gaussian boson sampling, as illustrated for binding of a thiol-containing aryl sulfonamide ligand to the tumor necrosis factor-$\alpha$ converting enzyme receptor. We show that cQED devices with a modest number of modes could be employed to simulate multimode systems by re-purposing working modes through measurement and re-initialization. We anticipate a wide range of GBS applications could be implemented on compact 3D cQED processors analogously, using the holographic approach. Simulations on qubit-based quantum computers could be implemented analogously, using circuits that represent continuous variables in terms of truncated expansions of Fock states.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16810'&gt;arXiv:2403.16810&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 25 Mar 2024 14:32:40 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Locally Purified Density Operators for Symmetry-Protected Topological Phases in Mixed States</title>

We extend the concept of injectivity, originally associated with matrix product states and projected entangled pair states, to LPDOs in $(1+1)D$ and $(2+1)D$ systems, unveiling two distinct types of injectivity conditions inherent in short-range entangled density matrices. Within the LPDO framework, we outline a classification scheme for decohered average symmetry-protected topological (ASPT) phases, consistent with earlier results obtained through spectrum sequence techniques. We first illustrate our framework with ASPT phases protected by fermion parity symmetry, then extend the classification of ASPT phases to a general group extension. We demonstrate examples of explicit construction of fixed-point LPDOs for ASPT phases including intrinsic ASPTs in both $(1+1)D$ and $(2+1)D$ systems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16978'&gt;arXiv:2403.16978&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 25 Mar 2024 17:41:27 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Tensor network formulation of symmetry protected topological phases in mixed states</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17069</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Hanyu Xue, Jong Yeon Lee, Yimu Bao&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We define and classify symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases in mixed states based on the tensor network formulation of the density matrix. In one dimension, we introduce strong injective matrix product density operators (MPDO), which describe a broad class of short-range correlated mixed states, including the locally decohered SPT states. We map strong injective MPDO to a pure state in the doubled Hilbert space and define the SPT phases according to the cohomology class of the symmetry group in the doubled state. Although the doubled state exhibits an enlarged symmetry, the possible SPT phases are also constrained by the Hermiticity and the semi-positivity of the density matrix. We here obtain a complete classification of SPT phases with a direct product of strong $G$ and weak $K$ unitary symmetry given by the cohomology group $H^2(G, \text{U}(1))\oplus H^1(K, H^1(G, \text{U}(1)))$. The SPT phases in our definition are preserved under symmetric local circuits consisting of non-degenerate channels. This motivates an alternative definition of SPT phases according to the equivalence class of mixed states under a ``one-way" connection using symmetric non-degenerate channels. In locally purifiable MPDO with strong symmetry, we prove that this alternative definition reproduces the cohomology classification. We further extend our results to two-dimensional mixed states described by strong semi-injective tensor network density operators and classify the possible SPT phases.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17069'&gt;arXiv:2403.17069&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 25 Mar 2024 18:04:29 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

Furthermore, we provide convincing numerical evidence that its quasi-long range order is well explained by the compactified boson conformal field theory (CFT) and the chiral transition is in perfect agreement with the Ising CFT, including central charge, scaling dimension spectrum, and operator product expansion coefficients.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17309'&gt;arXiv:2403.17309&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 26 Mar 2024 01:33:49 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17912</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Ang Yang, Jinlou Ma, Lei Ying&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The conventional wisdom suggests that transports of conserved quantities in non-integrable quantum many-body systems at high temperatures are diffusive. However, we discover a counterexample of this paradigm by uncovering anomalous hydrodynamics in a spin-1/2 XXZ chain with power-law couplings. This model, classified as non-integrable due to its Wigner-Dyson level-spacing statistics in the random matrix theory, exhibits a surprising superdiffusive-ballistic-superdiffusive transport transition by varying the power-law exponent of couplings for a fixed anisotropy. Our findings are verified by multiple observables, including the spin-spin autocorrelator, mean-square displacement, and spin conductivity. Interestingly, we further quantify the degree of quantum chaos using the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the entanglement entropy distributions of the model's eigenstates and a random state. Remarkably, an observed local maximum in the divergence near the transition boundary suggests a link between anomalous hydrodynamics and a suppression of quantum chaos. This work offers another deep understanding of emergent anomalous transport phenomena in a wider range of non-integrable quantum many-body systems&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17912'&gt;arXiv:2403.17912&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 26 Mar 2024 17:50:04 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>EinExprs: Contraction Paths of Tensor Networks as Symbolic Expressions</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Sergio Sanchez-Ramirez, Jofre Vallès-Muns, Artur Garcia-Saez&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Tensor Networks are graph representations of summation expressions in which vertices represent tensors and edges represent tensor indices or vector spaces. In this work, we present EinExprs.jl, a Julia package for contraction path optimization that offers state-of-art optimizers. We propose a representation of the contraction path of a Tensor Network based on symbolic expressions. Using this package the user may choose among a collection of different methods such as Greedy algorithms, or an approach based on the hypergraph partitioning problem. We benchmark this library with examples obtained from the simulation of Random Quantum Circuits (RQC), a well known example where Tensor Networks provide state-of-the-art methods.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18030'&gt;arXiv:2403.18030&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 26 Mar 2024 18:38:00 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Exact Solution of Bipartite Fluctuations in One-Dimensional Fermions</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18523</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Kazuya Fujimoto, Tomohiro Sasamoto&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Emergence of hydrodynamics in quantum many-body systems has recently garnered growing interest. The recent experiment of ultracold atoms [J. F. Wienand {\it et al.}, Nat. Phys. (2024), doi:10.1038/s41567-024-02611-z] studied emergent hydrodynamics in hard-core bosons using a bipartite fluctuation, which quantifies how the particle number fluctuates in a subsystem. In this Letter, we theoretically study the variance of a bipartite fluctuation in one-dimensional noninteracting fermionic dynamics starting from an alternating state, deriving the exact solution of the variance and its asymptotic linear growth law for the long-time dynamics. To compare the theoretical prediction with the experiment, we generalize our exact solution by incorporating the incompleteness of the initial alternating state, deriving the general linear growth law analytically. We find that it shows good agreement with the experimentally observed variance growth without any fitting parameters. Furthermore, we estimate a time scale for the local equilibration using our exact solution, finding that the time scale is independent of the initial incompleteness. To investigate the interaction effect, we implement numerical studies for the variance growth in interacting fermions, which has yet to be explored experimentally. As a result, we find that the presence of interactions breaks the linear variance growth derived in the noninteracting fermions. Our exact solutions and numerical findings here lay a foundation for growing bipartite fluctuations in quantum many-body dynamics.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18523'&gt;arXiv:2403.18523&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 27 Mar 2024 12:54:56 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Classifying symmetric and symmetry-broken spin chain phases with anomalous group actions</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Jose Garre Rubio, Andras Molnar, Yoshiko Ogata&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We consider the classification problem of quantum spin chains invariant under local decomposable group actions, covering matrix product unitaries (MPUs), using an operator algebraic approach. We focus on finite group symmetries hosting both symmetric and symmetry broken phases. The local-decomposable group actions we consider have a 3-cocycle class of the symmetry group associated to them. We derive invariants for our classification that naturally cover one-dimensional symmetry protected topological (SPT) phases. We prove that these invariants coincide with the ones of [J. Garre Rubio et al, Quantum 7, 927 (2023)] using matrix product states (MPSs) techniques, by explicitly working out the GNS representation of MPSs and MPUs, resulting in a useful dictionary between both approaches that could be of independent interest.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18573'&gt;arXiv:2403.18573&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 27 Mar 2024 13:54:45 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>An AI-powered Technology Stack for Solving Many-Electron Field Theory</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18840</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Pengcheng Hou, Tao Wang, Daniel Cerkoney, Xiansheng Cai, Zhiyi Li, Youjin Deng, Lei Wang, Kun Chen&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Quantum field theory (QFT) for interacting many-electron systems is fundamental to condensed matter physics, yet achieving accurate solutions confronts computational challenges in managing the combinatorial complexity of Feynman diagrams, implementing systematic renormalization, and evaluating high-dimensional integrals. We present a unifying framework that integrates QFT computational workflows with an AI-powered technology stack. A cornerstone of this framework is representing Feynman diagrams as computational graphs, which structures the inherent mathematical complexity and facilitates the application of optimized algorithms developed for machine learning and high-performance computing. Consequently, automatic differentiation, native to these graph representations, delivers efficient, fully automated, high-order field-theoretic renormalization procedures. This graph-centric approach also enables sophisticated numerical integration; our neural-network-enhanced Monte Carlo method, accelerated via massively parallel GPU implementation, efficiently evaluates challenging high-dimensional diagrammatic integrals. Applying this framework to the uniform electron gas, we determine the quasiparticle effective mass to a precision significantly surpassing current state-of-the-art simulations. Our work demonstrates the transformative potential of integrating AI-driven computational advances with QFT, opening systematic pathways for solving complex quantum many-body problems across disciplines.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18840'&gt;arXiv:2403.18840&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 28 Feb 2024 03:45:55 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Regularized dynamical parametric approximation</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19234</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Michael Feischl, Caroline Lasser, Christian Lubich, Jörg Nick&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; This paper studies the numerical approximation of evolution equations by nonlinear parametrizations $u(t)=\Phi(q(t))$ with time-dependent parameters $q(t)$, which are to be determined in the computation. The motivation comes from approximations in quantum dynamics by multiple Gaussians and approximations of various dynamical problems by tensor networks and neural networks. In all these cases, the parametrization is typically irregular: the derivative $\Phi'(q)$ can have arbitrarily small singular values and may have varying rank. We derive approximation results for a regularized approach in the time-continuous case as well as in time-discretized cases. With a suitable choice of the regularization parameter and the time stepsize, the approach can be successfully applied in irregular situations, even though it runs counter to the basic principle in numerical analysis to avoid solving ill-posed subproblems when aiming for a stable algorithm. Numerical experiments with sums of Gaussians for approximating quantum dynamics and with neural networks for approximating the flow map of a system of ordinary differential equations illustrate and complement the theoretical results.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19234'&gt;arXiv:2403.19234&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 28 Mar 2024 08:45:56 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Tensor Network-Constrained Kernel Machines as Gaussian Processes</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Frederiek Wesel, Kim Batselier&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Tensor Networks (TNs) have recently been used to speed up kernel machines by constraining the model weights, yielding exponential computational and storage savings. In this paper we prove that the outputs of Canonical Polyadic Decomposition (CPD) and Tensor Train (TT)-constrained kernel machines recover a Gaussian Process (GP), which we fully characterize, when placing i.i.d. priors over their parameters. We analyze the convergence of both CPD and TT-constrained models, and show how TT yields models exhibiting more GP behavior compared to CPD, for the same number of model parameters. We empirically observe this behavior in two numerical experiments where we respectively analyze the convergence to the GP and the performance at prediction. We thereby establish a connection between TN-constrained kernel machines and GPs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19500'&gt;arXiv:2403.19500&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 28 Mar 2024 15:29:30 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Quantum simulation of entanglement and hadronization in jet production: lessons from the massive Schwinger model</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00087</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Adrien Florio, David Frenklakh, Kazuki Ikeda, Dmitri E. Kharzeev, Vladimir Korepin, Shuzhe Shi, Kwangmin Yu&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The possible link between entanglement and thermalization, and the dynamics of hadronization are addressed by studying the real-time response of the massive Schwinger model coupled to external sources. This setup mimics the production and fragmentation of quark jets, as the Schwinger model and QCD share the properties of confinement and chiral symmetry breaking. By using quantum simulations on classical hardware, we study the entanglement between the produced jets, and observe the growth of the corresponding entanglement entropy in time. This growth arises from the increased number of contributing eigenstates of the reduced density matrix with sufficiently large and close eigenvalues. We also investigate the physical nature of these eigenstates, and find that at early times they correspond to fermionic Fock states. We then observe the transition from these fermionic Fock states to meson-like bound states as a function of time. In other words, we observe how hadronization develops in real time. At late times, the local observables at mid-rapidity (such as the fermion density and the electric field) approach approximately constant values, suggesting the onset of equilibrium and approach to thermalization.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00087'&gt;arXiv:2404.00087&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 29 Mar 2024 18:00:00 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Numerical evidence for spin chirality emerging from itinerant ferromagnets in bands with Berry curvature</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Shuai Yang, Zhiyu Dong, Yan Chen&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The behavior of strongly interacting electrons in bands with Berry curvature is a problem of wide interest. In this paper, we study this problem by numerically studying a fluxed Hubbard-type model on square lattice. Using this model, we demonstrate a metallic ferromagnet in electron bands equipped with Berry curvature can develop non-coplanar spin order in which spin polarization axes at different position span finite solid angles. We find spin chirality can emerge in this setting by doping or adding gauge flux on top of a collinear ferromagnet. This result supports the prediction of spin chirality occurring through an emergent spin orbital interaction. Meanwhile, our result shows that, on top a ferromagnetic background, the spin chirality emerges at a finite threshold value of orbital magnetization, resembling the predicted behavior in theory.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00706'&gt;arXiv:2404.00706&lt;/a&gt;] Published Sun, 31 Mar 2024 14:52:48 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Building up quantum spacetimes with BCFT Legos</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Ling-Yan Hung, Yikun Jiang&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Is it possible to read off the quantum gravity dual of a CFT directly from its operator algebra? In this essay, we present a step-by-step recipe synthesizing results and techniques from conformal bootstrap, topological symmetries, tensor networks, a novel symmetry-preserving real-space renormalization algorithm devised originally in lattice models, and the asymptotics of quantum $6j$ symbols, thereby providing an answer in the affirmative. Quantum 2D Liouville theory serves as a simple and explicit example, illustrating how the quantum gravitational path integral can be built up from local pieces of BCFT correlation functions, which we call the ``BCFT Legos''. The constructive map between gravity and CFT naturally and explicitly bridges local geometrical data, algebraic structures, and quantum entanglement, as envisaged by the $\it{It \, from \, Qubit}$ motto.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00877'&gt;arXiv:2404.00877&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 01 Apr 2024 03:14:36 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Dual-unitary shadow tomography</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01068</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Ahmed A. Akhtar, Namit Anand, Jeffrey Marshall, Yi-Zhuang You&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We introduce ``dual-unitary shadow tomography'' (DUST), a classical shadow tomography protocol based on dual-unitary brick-wall circuits. To quantify the performance of DUST, we study operator spreading and Pauli weight dynamics in one-dimensional qubit systems, evolved by random two-local dual-unitary gates arranged in a brick-wall structure, ending with a measurement layer. We do this by deriving general constraints on the Pauli weight transfer matrix and specializing to the case of dual-unitarity. Remarkably, we find that operator spreading in these circuits have a rich structure resembling that of relativistic quantum field theories, with massless chiral excitations that can decay or fuse into each other, which we call left- or right-movers. We develop a mean-field description of the Pauli weight in terms of $\rho(x,t)$, which represents the probability of having nontrivial support at site $x$ and depth $t$ starting from a fixed weight distribution. We develop an equation of state for $\rho(x,t)$ and simulate it numerically using Monte Carlo simulations. For the task of predicting operators with (nearly) full support, we show that DUST outperforms brick-wall Clifford shadows of equal depth. This advantage is further pronounced for small system sizes and our results are generally robust to finite-size effects.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01068'&gt;arXiv:2404.01068&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 01 Apr 2024 12:02:51 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Understanding and utilizing the inner bonds of process tensors</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01287</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Moritz Cygorek, Erik M. Gauger&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Process tensor matrix product operators (PT-MPOs) enable numerically exact simulations for an unprecedentedly broad range of open quantum systems. By representing environment influences in MPO form, they can be efficiently compressed using established algorithms. The dimensions of inner bonds of the compressed PT-MPO may be viewed as an indicator of the complexity of the environment. Here, we show that the inner bonds themselves, not only their dimensions, have a concrete physical meaning: They represent the subspace of the full environment Liouville space which hosts environment excitations that may influence the subsequent open quantum systems dynamics the most. This connection can be expressed in terms of lossy linear transformations, whose pseudoinverses facilitate the extraction of environment observables. We demonstrate this by extracting the environment spin of a central spin problem, the current through a quantum system coupled to two leads, the number of photons emitted from quantum emitters into a structured environment, and the distribution of the total absorbed energy in a driven non-Markovian quantum system into system, environment, and interaction energy terms. Numerical tests further indicate that different PT-MPO algorithms compress environments to similar subspaces. Thus, the physical interpretation of inner bonds of PT-MPOs both provides a conceptional understanding and it enables new practical applications.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01287'&gt;arXiv:2404.01287&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 01 Apr 2024 17:56:29 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Critical spin chains and loop models with $PSU(n)$ symmetry</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01935</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Paul Roux, Jesper Lykke Jacobsen, Sylvain Ribault, Hubert Saleur&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Starting with the Ising model, statistical models with global symmetries provide fruitful approaches to interesting physical systems, for example percolation or polymers. These include the $O(n)$ model (symmetry group $O(n)$) and the Potts model (symmetry group $S_Q$). Both models make sense for $n,Q\in \mathbb{C}$ and not just $n,Q\in \mathbb{N}$, and both give rise to a conformal field theory in the critical limit. Here, we study similar models based on the group $PSU(n)$. We focus on the two-dimensional case, where the models can be described either as gases of non-intersecting orientable loops, or as alternating spin chains. This allows us to determine their spectra either by computing a twisted torus partition function, or by studying representations of the walled Brauer algebra. In the critical limit, our models give rise to a CFT that exists for any $n\in\mathbb{C}$ and has a global $PSU(n)$ symmetry. Its spectrum is similar to those of the $O(n)$ and Potts CFTs, but a bit simpler. We conjecture that the $O(n)$ CFT is a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ orbifold of the $PSU(n)$ CFT, where $\mathbb{Z}_2$ acts as complex conjugation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01935'&gt;arXiv:2404.01935&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 02 Apr 2024 13:30:17 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>The ground state of electron-doped $t-t'-J$ model on cylinders</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01979</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Yang Shen, Xiangjian Qian, Mingpu Qin&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We perform a comprehensive study of the electron-doped $t-t'-J$ model on cylinders with Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG). We adopt both periodic and anti-periodic boundary conditions along the circumference direction to explore the finite size effect. We study doping levels of $1/6$, $1/8$, and $1/12$ which represent the most interesting region in the phase diagram of electron-doped cuprates. We find that for width-4 and 6 systems, the ground state for fixed doping switches between anti-ferromagnetic Neel state and stripe state under different boundary conditions and with system widths, indicating the presence of large finite size effect in the $t-t'-J$ model. We also have a careful analysis of the $d$-wave pairing correlations which also changes quantitatively with boundary conditions and widths of the system. However, the pairing correlations are enhanced when the system becomes wider for all dopings, suggesting the existence of possible long-ranged superconducting order in the thermodynamic limit. The width-8 results are found to be dependent on the starting state in the DMRG calculation for the kept states we can reach. For width-8 system only Neel (stripe) state can be stabilized in DMRG calculation for $1/12$ ($1/6$) doping, while both stripe and Neel states are stable in the DMRG sweep for $1/8$ doping, regardless of the boundary conditions. These results indicate that $1/8$ doping is likely to lie in the boundary of a phase transition between the Neel phase with lower doping and the stripe phase with higher doping, consistent with the previous study. The sensitivity of ground state on boundary conditions and size observed in this work is similar to that in the $t'$- Hubbard model.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01979'&gt;arXiv:2404.01979&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 02 Apr 2024 14:18:24 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Transmigration of Edge States with Interaction in Su-Schrieffer-Heeger Chain</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Jyoti Bisht, Somenath Jalal, Brijesh Kumar&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The effect of Hubbard and Kondo interactions on the edge states in the half-filled Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chain of electrons is investigated by studying the behaviour of charge quasiparticles using Kumar representation and density matrix renormalization group method. For any finite dimerization of hopping, by increasing the Hubbard interaction, the edge states are found to transmigrate from the physical charge gap to a high energy gap through an intermediate phase without the edge states. The extent of this phase with no edge states shrinks smoothly upon increasing the dimerization. The transmigration of edge states from the charge gap to the high energy gap is also found to occur with Kondo interaction, but through an intermediate phase which itself changes from having no edge states for weak dimerization to having the edge states in the physical as well as the high energy gaps coexisting from moderate to strong dimerization.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02259'&gt;arXiv:2404.02259&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 02 Apr 2024 19:29:12 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Entanglement structures from modified IR geometry</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02737</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Xin-Xiang Ju, Teng-Zhou Lai, Bo-Hao Liu, Wen-Bin Pan, Ya-Wen Sun&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We investigate a new proposal connecting the geometry at various radial scales in asymptotic AdS spacetime with entanglement structure at corresponding real-space length scales of the boundary theory. With this proposal, the bulk IR geometry encodes the long-scale entanglement structure of the dual quantum system. We consider two distinct types of IR geometries, namely the spherical case and the hyperbolic case, which are intimately related to the physics of differential entropy and brane-world holography separately. We explore the corresponding change in the dual long-scale entanglement structures, utilizing the tools of the Ryu-Takayanagi formula, conditional mutual information, and partial entanglement entropy. The results indicate that modifying the IR geometry leads to a redistribution of entanglement at scales longer than a critical length determined by the location of the IR region, with the two modified IR geometries corresponding to two opposite ways of redistribution. Furthermore, we establish the maximum amount of entanglement that can be modified, which is proportional to the area of the IR region.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02737'&gt;arXiv:2404.02737&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 03 Apr 2024 13:35:13 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Mean-field theory of 1+1D $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theory with matter</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02890</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Matjaž Kebrič, Ulrich Schollwöck, Fabian Grusdt&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Lattice gauge theories (LGTs) provide valuable insights into problems in strongly correlated many-body systems. Confinement which arises when matter is coupled to gauge fields is just one of the open problems, where LGT formalism can explain the underlying mechanism. However, coupling gauge fields to dynamical charges complicates the theoretical and experimental treatment of the problem. Developing a simplified mean-field theory is thus one of the ways to gain new insights into these complicated systems. Here we develop a mean-field theory of a paradigmatic 1+1D $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theory with superconducting pairing term, the gauged Kitaev chain, by decoupling charge and $\mathbb{Z}_2$ fields while enforcing the Gauss law on the mean-field level. We first determine the phase diagram of the original model in the context of confinement, which allows us to identify the symmetry-protected topological transition in the Kitaev chain as a confinement transition. We then compute the phase diagram of the effective mean-field theory, which correctly captures the main features of the original LGT. This is furthermore confirmed by the Green's function results and a direct comparison of the ground state energy. This simple LGT can be implemented in state-of-the art cold atom experiments. We thus also consider string-length histograms and the electric field polarization, which are easily accessible quantities in experimental setups and show that they reliably capture the various phases.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02890'&gt;arXiv:2404.02890&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 03 Apr 2024 17:45:40 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Zero-temperature entanglement membranes in quantum circuits</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02975</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Grace M. Sommers, Sarang Gopalakrishnan, Michael J. Gullans, David A. Huse&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; In chaotic quantum systems, the entanglement of a region $A$ can be described in terms of the surface tension of a spacetime membrane pinned to the boundary of $A$. Here, we interpret the tension of this entanglement membrane in terms of the rate at which information "flows" across it. For any orientation of the membrane, one can define (generically nonunitary) dynamics across the membrane; we explore this dynamics in various space-time translation-invariant (STTI) stabilizer circuits in one and two spatial dimensions. We find that the flux of information across the membrane in these STTI circuits reaches a steady state. In the cases where this dynamics is nonunitary and the steady state flux is nonzero, this occurs because the dynamics across the membrane is unitary in a subspace of extensive entropy. This generalized unitarity is present in a broad class of STTI stabilizer circuits, and is also present in some special non-stabilizer models. The existence of multiple unitary (or generalized unitary) directions forces the entanglement membrane tension to be a piecewise linear function of the orientation of the membrane; in this respect, the entanglement membrane behaves like an interface in a zero-temperature classical lattice model. We argue that entanglement membranes in random stabilizer circuits that produce volume-law entanglement are also effectively at zero temperature.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02975'&gt;arXiv:2404.02975&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 03 Apr 2024 18:00:52 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

Our concrete and broadly applicable holographic toy model simulates gravitational self-interactions in the bulk and features an emergent CFT with nontrivial correlations on the boundary. We measure the CFT data contained in the two- and three-point functions and clarify how a thermal CFT is simulated through an effective black hole geometry. As a concrete example, we propose and simulate an experimentally feasible protocol to measure the holographic CFT using electrical circuits.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03062'&gt;arXiv:2404.03062&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 03 Apr 2024 21:04:56 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Direct interpolative construction of the discrete Fourier transform as a matrix product operator</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03182</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Jielun Chen, Michael Lindsey&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The quantum Fourier transform (QFT), which can be viewed as a reindexing of the discrete Fourier transform (DFT), has been shown to be compressible as a low-rank matrix product operator (MPO) or quantized tensor train (QTT) operator. However, the original proof of this fact does not furnish a construction of the MPO with a guaranteed error bound. Meanwhile, the existing practical construction of this MPO, based on the compression of a quantum circuit, is not as efficient as possible. We present a simple closed-form construction of the QFT MPO using the interpolative decomposition, with guaranteed near-optimal compression error for a given rank. This construction can speed up the application of the QFT and the DFT, respectively, in quantum circuit simulations and QTT applications. We also connect our interpolative construction to the approximate quantum Fourier transform (AQFT) by demonstrating that the AQFT can be viewed as an MPO constructed using a different interpolation scheme.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03182'&gt;arXiv:2404.03182&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 04 Apr 2024 03:42:17 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Multipartite edge modes and tensor networks</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03651</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Chris Akers, Ronak M. Soni, Annie Y. Wei&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Holographic tensor networks model AdS/CFT, but so far they have been limited by involving only systems that are very different from gravity. Unfortunately, we cannot straightforwardly discretize gravity to incorporate it, because that would break diffeomorphism invariance. In this note, we explore a resolution. In low dimensions gravity can be written as a topological gauge theory, which can be discretized without breaking gauge-invariance. However, new problems arise. Foremost, we now need a qualitatively new kind of "area operator," which has no relation to the number of links along the cut and is instead topological. Secondly, the inclusion of matter becomes trickier. We successfully construct a tensor network both including matter and with this new type of area. Notably, while this area is still related to the entanglement in "edge mode" degrees of freedom, the edge modes are no longer bipartite entangled pairs. Instead they are highly multipartite. Along the way, we calculate the entropy of novel subalgebras in a particular topological gauge theory. We also show that the multipartite nature of the edge modes gives rise to non-commuting area operators, a property that other tensor networks do not exhibit.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03651'&gt;arXiv:2404.03651&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 04 Apr 2024 17:59:22 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Dynamical heterogeneity and large deviations in the open quantum East glass model from tensor networks</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Luke Causer, Mari Carmen Bañuls, Juan P. Garrahan&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We study the non-equilibrium dynamics of the dissipative quantum East model via numerical tensor networks. We use matrix product states to represent evolution under quantum-jump unravellings for sizes beyond those accessible to exact diagonalisation. This allows us to demonstrate that dynamical heterogeneity accompanies slow relaxation, in analogy with what is seen in classical glassy systems. Furthermore, using variational matrix product operators we: (i) compute the spectral gap of the Lindbladian, and show that glassiness is enhanced in the presence of weak quantum fluctuations compared to the pure classical case, and (ii) obtain the dynamical large deviations by calculating the leading eigenvector of the tilted Lindbladian, and find clear evidence for a first-order active-inactive dynamical phase transition. We also show how to directly sample the rare quantum trajectories associated to the large deviations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03750'&gt;arXiv:2404.03750&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 04 Apr 2024 18:41:18 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Thermal Area Law in Long-Range Interacting Systems</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04172</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Donghoon Kim, Tomotaka Kuwahara, Keiji Saito&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The area law of the bipartite information measure characterizes one of the most fundamental aspects of quantum many-body physics. In thermal equilibrium, the area law for the mutual information universally holds at arbitrary temperatures as long as the systems have short-range interactions. In systems with power-law decaying interactions, $r^{-\alpha}$ ($r$: distance), conditions for the thermal area law are elusive. In this work, we aim to clarify the optimal condition $\alpha&gt; \alpha_c$ such that the thermal area law universally holds. A standard approach to considering the conditions is to focus on the magnitude of the boundary interaction between two subsystems. However, we find here that the thermal area law is more robust than this conventional argument suggests. We show the optimal threshold for the thermal area law by $\alpha_c= (D+1)/2$ ($D$: the spatial dimension of the lattice), assuming a power-law decay of the clustering for the bipartite correlations. Remarkably, this condition encompasses even the thermodynamically unstable regimes $\alpha &lt; D$. We verify this condition numerically, finding that it is qualitatively accurate for both integrable and non-integrable systems. Unconditional proof of the thermal area law is possible by developing the power-law clustering theorem for $\alpha &gt; D$ above a threshold temperature. Furthermore, the numerical calculation for the logarithmic negativity shows that the same criterion $\alpha &gt; (D+1)/2$ applies to the thermal area law for quantum entanglement.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04172'&gt;arXiv:2404.04172&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 05 Apr 2024 15:32:14 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Zeno physics of the Ising chain with symmetry-breaking boundary dephasing</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Umar Javed, Riccardo J. Valencia-Tortora, Jamir Marino, Vadim Oganesyan, Michael Kolodrubetz&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; In few-qubit systems, the quantum Zeno effect arises when measurement occurs sufficiently frequently that the spins are unable to relax between measurements. This can compete with Hamiltonian terms, resulting in interesting relaxation processes which depend non-monotonically on the ratio of measurement rate to coherent oscillations. While Zeno physics for a single qubit is well-understood, an interesting open question is how the Zeno effect is modified by coupling the measured spin to a non-trivial bulk. In this work, we study the effect of coupling a one-dimensional transverse field Ising to a Zeno spin which lives at the boundary. We find that sharp singularities occur in the boundary relaxation dynamics, which can be tied to the emergence or destruction of edge modes that can be found analytically. Finally, we provide numerical evidence that the dynamical singularities are stable in the presence of integrability-breaking interactions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04255'&gt;arXiv:2404.04255&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 05 Apr 2024 17:59:19 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Infinite Grassmann time-evolving matrix product operator method for zero-temperature equilibrium quantum impurity problems</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04757</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Chu Guo, Ruofan Chen&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The Grassmann time-evolving matrix product operator (GTEMPO) method has proven to be an accurate and efficient numerical method for the real-time dynamics of quantum impurity problems. Whereas its application for imaginary-time calculations is much less competitive compared to well-established methods such as the continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo (CTQMC). In this work, we unleash the full power of GTEMPO for zero-temperature imaginary-time calculations: the multi-time impurity state is time-translationally invariant with infinite boundary condition, therefore it can be represented as an infinite Grassmann matrix product state (GMPS) with nontrivial unit cell in a single time step, instead of an open boundary GMPS spanning the whole imaginary-time axis. We devise a very efficient infinite GTEMPO algorithm targeted at zero-temperature equilibrium quantum impurity problems, which is known to be a hard regime for quantum Monte Carlo methods. To demonstrate the performance of our method, we benchmark it against exact solutions in the noninteracting limit, and against CTQMC calculations in the Anderson impurity models with up to two orbitals, where we show that the required bond dimension of the infinite GMPS is much smaller than its finite-temperature counterpart.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04757'&gt;arXiv:2404.04757&lt;/a&gt;] Published Sat, 06 Apr 2024 23:42:46 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Solving quantum impurity problems on the L-shaped Kadanoff-Baym contour</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05410</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Ruofan Chen, Chu Guo&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The path integral formalism is the building block of many powerful numerical methods for quantum impurity problems. However, existing fermionic path integral based numerical calculations have only been performed in either the imaginary-time or the real-time axis, while the most generic scenario formulated on the L-shaped Kadanoff-Baym contour is left unexplored. In this work, we extended the recently developed Grassmann time-evolving matrix product operator (GTEMPO) method to solve quantum impurity problems directly on the Kadanoff-Baym contour. The resulting method is numerically exact, with only two sources of numerical errors, e.g., the time discretization error and the matrix product state bond truncation error. The accuracy of this method is numerically demonstrated against exact solutions in the noninteracting case, and against existing calculations on the real- and imaginary-time axes for the single-orbital Anderson impurity model. We also show that the numerical errors of the method can be well suppressed as we refine the hyperparameters. Our method is a perfect benchmarking baseline for its alternatives which often employ less-controlled approximations, and can also be used as a real-time impurity solver in dynamical mean field theory.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05410'&gt;arXiv:2404.05410&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 08 Apr 2024 11:21:06 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Global phase diagram of doped quantum spin liquid on the Kagome lattice</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05685</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Zheng-Tao Xu, Zheng-Cheng Gu, Shuo Yang&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; It has long been believed that doped quantum spin liquids (QSLs) can give rise to fascinating quantum phases, including the possibility of high-temperature superconductivity (SC) as proposed by P. W. Anderson's resonating valence bond (RVB) scenario. The Kagome lattice $t$-$J$ model is known to exhibit spin liquid behavior at half-filling, making it an ideal system for studying the properties of doped QSL. In this study, we employ the fermionic projected entangled simplex state (PESS) method to investigate the ground state properties of the Kagome lattice $t$-$J$ model with $t/J = 3.0$. Our results reveal a phase transition from charge density wave (CDW) states to uniform states around a critical doping level $\delta_c \approx 0.27$. Within the CDW phase, we observe different types of Wigner crystal (WC) formulated by doped holes that are energetically favored. As we enter the uniform phase, a non-Fermi liquid (NFL) state emerges within the doping range $0.27 &lt; \delta &lt; 0.32$, characterized by an exponential decay of all correlation functions. With further hole doping, we discover the appearance of a pair density wave (PDW) state within a narrow doping region $0.32 &lt; \delta &lt; 1/3$. We also discuss the potential experimental implications of our findings.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05685'&gt;arXiv:2404.05685&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 08 Apr 2024 17:10:07 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Chebyshev pseudosite matrix product state approach for cluster perturbation theory</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Pei-Yuan Zhao, Ke Ding, Shuo Yang&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We introduce the Chebyshev pseudosite matrix product state approach (ChePSMPS) as a solver for cluster perturbation theory (CPT), crucial for simulating spectral functions in two-dimensional electron-phonon ($e$-ph) coupling systems. ChePSMPS distinguishes itself from conventional exact diagonalization solvers by supporting larger clusters, thereby significantly mitigating finite-size effects. Free from the fermion sign problem, ChePSMPS enhances its ability to explore $e$-ph effects and generate high-resolution spectral functions in doped Mott insulators. We use this method to simulate the spectra for both one- and two-dimensional Hubbard-Holstein models, highlighting its superiority over other methods. Our findings validate ChePSMPS as a powerful and reliable Green's function solver. In conjunction with embedding methods, ChePSMPS emerges as an essential tool for simulating strongly correlated $e$-ph coupling systems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05686'&gt;arXiv:2404.05686&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 08 Apr 2024 17:10:11 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Effective Luttinger parameter and Kane-Fisher effect in quasiperiodic systems</title>

Vongkovit, Hansveer Singh, Romain Vasseur, Sarang Gopalakrishnan&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The ground states of interacting one-dimensional metals are generically Luttinger liquids. Luttinger liquid theory is usually considered for translation invariant systems. The Luttinger liquid description remains valid for weak quasiperiodic modulations; however, as the quasiperiodic modulation gets increasingly strong, it is increasingly renormalized and eventually fails, as the system becomes localized. We explore how quasiperiodic modulation renormalizes the Luttinger parameter characterizing this emergent Luttinger liquid, using the renormalization of transmission coefficients across a barrier as a proxy that remains valid for general quasiperiodic modulation. We find, unexpectedly, that quasiperiodic modulation weakens the effects of short-range interactions, but enhances those of long-range interactions. We support the former finding with matrix-product numerics. We also discuss how interactions affect the localization phase boundary.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05711'&gt;arXiv:2404.05711&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 08 Apr 2024 17:49:00 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Hybrid Tree Tensor Networks for quantum simulation</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05784</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Julian Schuhmacher, Marco Ballarin, Alberto Baiardi, Giuseppe Magnifico, Francesco Tacchino, Simone Montangero, Ivano Tavernelli&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Hybrid Tensor Networks (hTN) offer a promising solution for encoding variational quantum states beyond the capabilities of efficient classical methods or noisy quantum computers alone. However, their practical usefulness and many operational aspects of hTN-based algorithms, like the optimization of hTNs, the generalization of standard contraction rules to an hybrid setting, and the design of application-oriented architectures have not been thoroughly investigated yet. In this work, we introduce a novel algorithm to perform ground state optimizations with hybrid Tree Tensor Networks (hTTNs), discussing its advantages and roadblocks, and identifying a set of promising applications. We benchmark our approach on two paradigmatic models, namely the Ising model at the critical point and the Toric code Hamiltonian. In both cases, we successfully demonstrate that hTTNs can improve upon classical equivalents with equal bond dimension in the classical part.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05784'&gt;arXiv:2404.05784&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 08 Apr 2024 18:00:00 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Quantum Spin Liquids in Weak Mott Insulators with a Spin-Orbit Coupling</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05806</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Asimpunya Mitra, Daniel J. Schultz, Yong Baek Kim&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The weak Mott insulating regime of the triangular lattice Hubbard model exhibits a rich magnetic phase diagram as a result of the ring exchange interaction in the spin Hamiltonian. These phases include the Kalmeyer-Laughlin type chiral spin liquid (CSL) and a valence bond solid (VBS). A natural question arises regarding the robustness of these phases in the presence of a weak spin-orbit coupling (SOC). In this study, we derive the effective spin model for the spin-orbit coupled triangular lattice Hubbard model in the weak Mott insulting regime, including all SOC-mediated spin-bilinears and ring-exchange interactions. We then construct a simplified spin model keeping only the most relevant SOC-mediated spin interactions. Using infinite density matrix renormalization group (iDMRG) we show that the CSL and VBS phases of the triangular lattice Hubbard model can be stabilized in the presence of a weak SOC. The stabilization results from a compensation between the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction and a SOC-mediated ring exchange interaction. We also provide additional qualitative arguments to intuitively understand the compensation mechanism in the iDMRG quantum phase diagrams. This mechanism for stabilization can potentially be useful for the experimental realization of quantum spin liquids.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05806'&gt;arXiv:2404.05806&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 08 Apr 2024 18:13:49 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Quantum computing topological invariants of two-dimensional quantum matter</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Marcel Niedermeier, Marc Nairn, Christian Flindt, Jose L. Lado&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Quantum algorithms provide a potential strategy for solving computational problems that are intractable by classical means. Computing the topological invariants of topological matter is one central problem in research on quantum materials, and a variety of numerical approaches for this purpose have been developed. However, the complexity of quantum many-body Hamiltonians makes calculations of topological invariants challenging for interacting systems. Here, we present two quantum circuits for calculating Chern numbers of two-dimensional quantum matter on quantum computers. Both circuits combine a gate-based adiabatic time-evolution over the discretized Brillouin zone with particular phase estimation techniques. The first algorithm uses many qubits, and we analyze it using a tensor-network simulator of quantum circuits. The second circuit uses fewer qubits, and we implement it experimentally on a quantum computer based on superconducting qubits. Our results establish a method for computing topological invariants with quantum circuits, taking a step towards characterizing interacting topological quantum matter using quantum computers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06048'&gt;arXiv:2404.06048&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 09 Apr 2024 06:22:50 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>The Tensor-Train Stochastic Finite Volume Method for Uncertainty Quantification</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06574</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Steven Walton, Svetlana Tokareva, Gianmarco Manzini&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The stochastic finite volume method offers an efficient one-pass approach for assessing uncertainty in hyperbolic conservation laws. Still, it struggles with the curse of dimensionality when dealing with multiple stochastic variables. We introduce the stochastic finite volume method within the tensor-train framework to counteract this limitation. This integration, however, comes with its own set of difficulties, mainly due to the propensity for shock formation in hyperbolic systems. To overcome these issues, we have developed a tensor-train-adapted stochastic finite volume method that employs a global WENO reconstruction, making it suitable for such complex systems. This approach represents the first step in designing tensor-train techniques for hyperbolic systems and conservation laws involving shocks.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06574'&gt;arXiv:2404.06574&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 09 Apr 2024 18:52:30 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Field-induced Peierls phase in $S=1$ Heisenberg spins coupled to quantum phonons</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06875</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Shifeng Cui, Wenan Guo, G. G. Batrouni, Pinaki Sengupta&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Spin-Peierls transition occurs in a one-dimensional $S=1$ Heisenberg antiferromagnetic model with single-ion anisotropy, coupled to finite frequency bond phonons, in a magnetic field. Our results indicate that for the pure Heisenberg model, any Peierls transition is suppressed by quantum fluctuations of the phonon field. However, a novel magnetic field-induced Spin-Peierls phase is realized in the presence of strong single-ion anisotropy. Contrary to the standard Peierls state, the periodicity of bond strength modulation in this field-induced Spin-Peierls state is variable and depends on the strength of the applied field. The nature of the ground state in this new phase and the associated field-driven transitions to and out of this phase are explored using extensive numerical simulations. In particular, we explore the spin and bond correlations and the evolution of bond order modulation with varying magnetic field.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06875'&gt;arXiv:2404.06875&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 10 Apr 2024 09:59:36 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Matrix product states and first quantization</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Jheng-Wei Li, Xavier Waintal&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Common wisdom says that the entanglement of fermionic systems can be low in the second quantization formalism but is extremely large in the first quantization. Hence Matrix Product State (MPS) methods based on moderate entanglement have been overwhelmingly formulated in second quantization. Here we introduce a first-quantized MPS approach to simulate quantum many-body systems. We show that by reformulating the way the fermionic anti-symmetry is handled, we arrive at MPS with a level of entanglement comparable to the usual one found in second quantization. We demonstrate our scheme on the one-dimensional $t$-$V$ model (spinless fermions with nearest neighbour density-density interaction) for both ground state and time evolution. For time evolution, we find that the entanglement entropy in first quantization is significantly smaller than in its second quantization counterpart.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07105'&gt;arXiv:2404.07105&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 10 Apr 2024 15:44:02 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Certifying almost all quantum states with few single-qubit measurements</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07281</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Hsin-Yuan Huang, John Preskill, Mehdi Soleimanifar&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Certifying that an n-qubit state synthesized in the lab is close to the target state is a fundamental task in quantum information science. However, existing rigorous protocols either require deep quantum circuits or exponentially many single-qubit measurements. In this work, we prove that almost all n-qubit target states, including those with exponential circuit complexity, can be certified from only O(n^2) single-qubit measurements. This result is established by a new technique that relates certification to the mixing time of a random walk. Our protocol has applications for benchmarking quantum systems, for optimizing quantum circuits to generate a desired target state, and for learning and verifying neural networks, tensor networks, and various other representations of quantum states using only single-qubit measurements. We show that such verified representations can be used to efficiently predict highly non-local properties that would otherwise require an exponential number of measurements. We demonstrate these applications in numerical experiments with up to 120 qubits, and observe advantage over existing methods such as cross-entropy benchmarking (XEB).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07281'&gt;arXiv:2404.07281&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 10 Apr 2024 18:21:11 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

By encoding the information about the charge sectors (and if applicable the twisted boundary conditions) in ancillary qubit(s), the intertwiner becomes a unitary operator which exchanges boundary conditions and charge sectors.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07727'&gt;arXiv:2404.07727&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 11 Apr 2024 13:18:35 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>High temperature transport in the one dimensional mass-imbalanced Fermi-Hubbard model</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Thomas G. Kiely, Erich J. Mueller&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We study transport in the one-dimensional mass-imbalanced Fermi-Hubbard model at infinite temperature, focusing on the case of strong interactions. Prior theoretical and experimental investigations have revealed unconventionally long transport timescales, with complications due to strong finite size effects. We compute the dynamical current-current correlation function directly in the thermodynamic limit using infinite tensor network techniques. We show that transport in the strong-imbalance limit is dominated by AC resonances, which we compute with an analytic expansion. We study the dephasing of these resonances with mass imbalance, $\eta$. In the small-imbalance limit, the model is nearly integrable. We connect these unusual limits by computing the DC conductivity and transport decay time as a function of $\eta$ and the interaction strength $U/t$. We propose an experimental protocol to measure these correlation functions in cold atom experiments.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08076'&gt;arXiv:2404.08076&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 11 Apr 2024 18:29:46 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Comparing quantum fluctuations in the spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ and spin-$1$ XXZ Heisenberg models on square and honeycomb lattices</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08099</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Masahiro Kadosawa, Masaaki Nakamura, Yukinori Ohta, Satoshi Nishimoto&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We present a detailed investigation of the XXZ Heisenberg model for spin-$1/2$ and spin-$1$ systems on square and honeycomb lattices. Utilizing the density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) method, complemented by Spiral Boundary Conditions (SBC) for mapping two-dimensional (2D) clusters onto one-dimensional (1D) chains, we meticulously explore the evolution of staggered magnetization and spin gaps across a broad spectrum of easy-axis anisotropies. Our study reveals that, despite the lower site coordination number of honeycomb lattice, which intuitively suggests increased quantum fluctuations in its Néel phase compared to the square lattice, the staggered magnetization in the honeycomb structure exhibits only a marginal reduction. Furthermore, our analysis demonstrates that the dependence of staggered magnetization on the XXZ anisotropy $\Delta$, except in close proximity to $\Delta=1$, aligns with series expansion predictions up to the 12th order. Notably, for the $S=1/2$ honeycomb lattice, deviations from the 10th order series expansion predictions near the isotropic Heisenberg limit emphasize the critical influence of quantum fluctuations on the spin excitation in its Néel state. Additionally, our findings are numerically consistent with the singular behavior of the spin gap near the isotropic Heisenberg limit as forecasted by spin-wave theory. The successful implementation of SBC marks a methodological advancement, streamlining the computational complexity involved in analyzing 2D models and paving the way for more precise determinations of physical properties in complex lattice systems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08099'&gt;arXiv:2404.08099&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 11 Apr 2024 19:35:55 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Rényi entropy of the permutationally invariant part of the ground state across a quantum phase transition</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08389</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Yuki Miyazaki, Giacomo Marmorini, Nobuo Furukawa, Daisuke Yamamoto&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We investigate the role of the permutationally invariant part of the density matrix (PIDM) in capturing the properties of the ground state of the system during a quantum phase transition. In the context of quantum state tomography, PIDM is known to be obtainable with only a low number of measurement settings, namely $\mathcal{O}(L^2)$, where $L$ is the system size. Considering the transverse-field Ising chain as an example, we compute the second-order Rényi entropy of PIDM for the ground state by using the density matrix renormalization group algorithm. In the ferromagnetic case, the ground state is permutationally invariant both in the limits of zero and infinite field, leading to vanishing Rényi entropy of PIDM. The latter exhibits a broad peak as a function of the transverse field around the quantum critical point, which gets more pronounced for larger system size. In the antiferromagnetic case, the peak structure disappears and the Rényi entropy diverges like $\mathcal{O}(L)$ in the whole field range of the ordered phase. We discuss the cause of these behaviors of the Rényi entropy of PIDM, examining the possible application of this experimentally tractable quantity to the analysis of phase transition phenomena.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08389'&gt;arXiv:2404.08389&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 12 Apr 2024 10:45:38 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Qubit frugal entanglement determination with the deep multi-scale entanglement renormalization ansatz</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08548</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Kushagra Garg, Zeeshan Ahmed, Andreas Thomasen&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We study the deep multi-scale entanglement renormalization ansatz (DMERA) on quantum hardware and the causal cone of a subset of the qubits which make up the ansatz. This causal cone spans $O(M+\log{N})$ physical qubits on a quantum device, where $M$ and $N$ are the subset size and the total number qubits in the ansatz respectively. This allows for the determination of the von Neumann entanglement entropy of the $N$ qubit wave-function using $O(M+\log{N})$ qubits by diagonalization of the reduced density matrix (RDM). We show this by randomly initializing a 16-qubit DMERA and diagonalizing the resulting RDM of the $M$-qubit subsystem using density matrix simulation. As an example of practical interest, we also encode the variational ground state of the quantum critical long-range transverse field Ising model (LRTIM) on 8 spins using DMERA. We perform density matrix simulation with and without noise to obtain entanglement entropies in separate experiments using only 4 qubits. Finally we repeat the experiment on the IBM Kyoto backend reproducing simulation results.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08548'&gt;arXiv:2404.08548&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 12 Apr 2024 15:43:18 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

This work introduces a tensor network approach for the Kolmogorov backward equation via approximating directly the Markov operator. We show that the high-dimensional Markov operator can be obtained under a functional hierarchical tensor (FHT) ansatz with a hierarchical sketching algorithm. When the terminal condition admits an FHT ansatz, the proposed operator outputs an FHT ansatz for the PDE solution through an efficient functional tensor network contraction procedure. In addition, the proposed operator-based approach also provides an efficient way to solve the Kolmogorov forward equation when the initial distribution is in an FHT ansatz. We apply the proposed approach successfully to two challenging time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau models with hundreds of variables.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08823'&gt;arXiv:2404.08823&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 12 Apr 2024 21:39:33 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Generalized Spectral Decomposition for Quantum Impurity Problems</title>

Here, we propose a general operation strategy to disentangle the shared bath into multiple auxiliary baths and relate the problem to a spectral decomposition problem of function matrix for applying the numerical renormalization group (NRG). We prove exactly that such decomposition is possible for models satisfying (block) circulant symmetry, and show how to construct the auxiliary baths for arbitrary impurity configuration by mapping its graph structure to the subgraph of a regular impurity configuration. We further propose an approximate decomposition algorithm to reduce the number of auxiliary baths and save the computational workload. Our work reveals a deep connection between quantum impurity problems and the graph theory, and provides a general scheme to extend the NRG applications for realistic multi-impurity systems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09444'&gt;arXiv:2404.09444&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 15 Apr 2024 04:05:17 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>The Cost of Entanglement Renormalization on a Fault-Tolerant Quantum Computer</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Joshua Job, Isaac H. Kim, Eric Johnston, Steve Adachi&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We perform a detailed resource estimate for the prospect of using deep entanglement renormalization ansatz (DMERA) on a fault-tolerant quantum computer, focusing on the regime in which the target system is large. For probing a relatively large system size ($64\times 64$), we observe up to an order of magnitude reduction in the number of qubits, compared to the approaches based on quantum phase estimation (QPE). We discuss two complementary strategies to measure the energy. The first approach is based on a random sampling of the local terms of the Hamiltonian, requiring $\mathcal{O}(1/\epsilon^2)$ invocations of quantum circuits, each of which have depth of at most $\mathcal{O}(\log N)$, where $\epsilon$ is the relative precision in the energy and $N$ is the system size. The second approach is based on a coherent estimation of the expectation value of observables averaged over space, which achieves the Heisenberg scaling while incurring only a logarithmic cost in the system size. For estimating the energy per site of $\epsilon$, $\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{\log N}{\epsilon} \right)$ $T$ gates and $\mathcal{O}\left(\log N \right)$ qubits suffice. The constant factor of the leading contribution is shown to be determined by the depth of the DMERA circuit, the gates used in the ansatz, and the periodicity of the circuit. We also derive tight bounds on the variance of the energy gradient, assuming the gates are random Pauli rotations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10050'&gt;arXiv:2404.10050&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 15 Apr 2024 18:00:17 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>A quantum eigenvalue solver based on tensor networks</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10223</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Oskar Leimkuhler, K. Birgitta Whaley&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Electronic ground states are of central importance in chemical simulations, but have remained beyond the reach of efficient classical algorithms except in cases of weak electron correlation or one-dimensional spatial geometry. We introduce a hybrid quantum-classical eigenvalue solver that constructs a wavefunction ansatz from a linear combination of matrix product states in rotated orbital bases, enabling the characterization of strongly correlated ground states with arbitrary spatial geometry. The energy is converged via a gradient-free generalized sweep algorithm based on quantum subspace diagonalization, with a potentially exponential speedup in the off-diagonal matrix element contractions upon translation into compact quantum circuits of linear depth in the number of qubits. Chemical accuracy is attained in numerical experiments for both a stretched water molecule and an octahedral arrangement of hydrogen atoms, achieving substantially better correlation energies compared to a unitary coupled-cluster benchmark, with orders of magnitude reductions in quantum resource estimates and a surprisingly high tolerance to shot noise. This proof-of-concept study suggests a promising new avenue for scaling up simulations of strongly correlated chemical systems on near-term quantum hardware.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10223'&gt;arXiv:2404.10223&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 16 Apr 2024 02:04:47 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Quantum Magnetic Skyrmion Operator</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Andreas Haller, Sebastián A. Díaz, Wolfgang Belzig, Thomas L. Schmidt&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We propose a variational wave function to represent quantum skyrmions as bosonic operators. The operator faithfully reproduces two fundamental features of quantum skyrmions: their classical magnetic order and a "quantum cloud" of local spin-flip excitations. Using exact numerical simulations of the ground states of a 2D chiral magnetic model, we find two regions in the single-skyrmion state diagram distinguished by their leading quantum corrections. We use matrix product state simulations of the adiabatic braiding of two skyrmions to verify that the operator representation of skyrmions is valid at large inter-skyrmion distances. Our work demonstrates that skyrmions can be approximately coarse-grained and represented by bosonic quasiparticles, which paves the way toward a field theory of many-skyrmion quantum phases and, unlike other approaches, incorporates the microscopic quantum fluctuations of individual skyrmions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10347'&gt;arXiv:2403.10347&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 15 Mar 2024 14:32:01 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Quantum phase transition and critical behavior between the gapless topological phases</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10576</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Hao-Long Zhang, Han-Ze Li, Sheng Yang, Xue-Jia Yu&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The phase transition between gapped topological phases represents a class of unconventional criticality beyond the Landau paradigm. However, recent research has shifted attention to topological phases without a bulk gap, where the phase transitions between them are still elusive. In this work, based on large-scale density matrix renormalization group techniques, we investigate the critical behaviors of the extended quantum XXZ model obtained by the Kennedy-Tasaki transformation. Using fidelity susceptibility as a diagnostic, we obtain a complete phase diagram, which includes both topological nontrivial and trivial gapless phases. Furthermore, as the XXZ-type anisotropy parameter $\Delta$ varies, both the critical points $h_c$ and correlation length exponent $\nu$ remain the same as in the $\Delta=0$ case, characterized by $c=3/2$ (Ising + free boson) conformal field theory. Our results indicate that fidelity susceptibility can effectively detect and reveal a stable unconventional critical line between the topologically distinct gapless phases for general $\Delta$. This work serves as a valuable reference for further research on phase transitions within the gapless topological phase of matter.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10576'&gt;arXiv:2404.10576&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 16 Apr 2024 13:55:58 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Phase diagram of the quantum spin-1/2 Heisenberg-$Γ$ model on a frustrated zigzag chain</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10615</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Hidehiro Saito, Chisa Hotta&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We investigate the quantum spin-1/2 zigzag chain with frustrated $J_1$-$J_2$ Heisenberg interactions, incorporating additional off-diagonal exchange interactions known as the $\Gamma$ term, both with and without an applied magnetic field. Based on the density-matrix renormalization group calculation, we map out the ground state phase diagram that shows a variety of magnetic and nonmagnetic phases including multicritical points and several exactly solvable points. Upon introducing a finite $\Gamma$ term, we observe the persistent dimer singlet state of the $J_1$-$J_2$ Heisenberg model, sustaining a nonzero spin gap, while also giving rise to a gapless nonmagnetic excitation, manifesting in the substantial zero-energy peak in the nematic dynamical structure factor. This gapless peak-mode remaining almost as a fluctuation to the ground state, induces dilute but robust concentration of nematicity on top of singlets on dimers, which we call the nematic singlet-dimer phase. When the whole nematic excited mode condenses and replaces the singlet, the nematic-dimer phase transforms to the Ising-type ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic long-range orders that arise from the $\Gamma$ term spontaneously selecting magnetic easy axes. Its orientations dictate the type of magnetic order under geometric frustration effects as predicted by Landau's mean-field theory. These theoretical findings provide insights into the exotic low-temperature phase observed in YbCuS$_2$, characterized by gapless excitations and seemingly nonmagnetic behavior accompanied by incommensurate correlations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10615'&gt;arXiv:2404.10615&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 16 Apr 2024 14:41:06 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Keeping the photon in the dark: Enabling full quantum dot control by chirped pulses and magnetic fields</title>

Reiter, Gregor Weihs&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Because dark excitons in quantum dots are not directly optically accessible, so far they have not played a significant role in using quantum dots for photon generation. They possess significantly longer lifetimes than their brighter counterparts and hence offer enormous potential for photon storage or manipulation. In this work, we demonstrate an all-optical storage and retrieval of the spin-forbidden dark exciton in a quantum dot from the ground state employing chirped pulses and an in-plane magnetic field. Our experimental findings are in excellent agreement with theoretical predictions of the dynamics calculated using state-of-the-art product tensor methods. Our scheme enables an all-optical control of dark states without relying on any preceding decays. This opens up a new dimension for optimal quantum control and time-bin entangled photon pair generation from quantum dots.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10708'&gt;arXiv:2404.10708&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 16 Apr 2024 16:32:10 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Hilbert space delocalization under random unitary circuits</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Xhek Turkeshi, Piotr Sierant&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Unitary dynamics of a quantum system initialized in a selected basis state yields, generically, a state that is a superposition of all the basis states. This process, associated with the quantum information scrambling and intimately tied to the resource theory of coherence, may be viewed as a gradual delocalization of the system's state in the Hilbert space. This work analyzes the Hilbert space delocalization under dynamics of random quantum circuits, which serve as a minimal model of chaotic dynamics of quantum many-body systems. We employ analytical methods based on the replica trick and Weingarten calculus to investigate the time evolution of the participation entropies which quantify the Hilbert space delocalization. We demonstrate that the participation entropies approach, up to a fixed accuracy, their long-time saturation value in times that scale logarithmically with the system size. Exact numerical simulations and tensor network techniques corroborate our findings.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10725'&gt;arXiv:2404.10725&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 16 Apr 2024 16:59:41 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Testing Link Fidelity in a Quantum Network using Operational Form of Trace Distance with Error Bounds</title>

Campbell, Nicola Marchetti, John Dooley, Indrakshi Dey&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Quantum state comparison, utilizing metrics like fidelity and trace distance, underpins the assessment of quantum networks within quantum information theory. While recent research has expanded theoretical understanding, incorporating error analysis and scalability considerations remains crucial for practical applications. The primary contribution of this letter is to address these gaps by deriving the novel operational trace distance for multi-node networks, establishing a trace distance vs. fidelity benchmark incorporating error bounds, and bridging quantum operations with tensor network analysis. We further explore the application of tensor network tools to quantum networks, offering new analytical avenues. This comprehensive approach provides a robust framework for evaluating quantum network performance under realistic error conditions, facilitating the development of reliable quantum technologies.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10803'&gt;arXiv:2404.10803&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 16 Apr 2024 08:36:37 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Higher Hall conductivity from a single wave function: Obstructions to symmetry-preserving gapped edge of (2+1)D topological order</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10814</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Ryohei Kobayashi, Taige Wang, Tomohiro Soejima, Roger S. K. Mong, Shinsei Ryu&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; A (2+1)D topological ordered phase with U(1) symmetry may or may not have a symmetric gapped edge state, even if both thermal and electric Hall conductivity are vanishing. It is recently discovered that there are "higher" versions of Hall conductivity valid for fermionic fractional quantum Hall (FQH) states, which obstructs symmetry-preserving gapped edge state beyond thermal and electric Hall conductivity. In this paper, we show that one can extract higher Hall conductivity from a single wave function of an FQH state, by evaluating the expectation value of the "partial rotation" unitary which is a combination of partial spatial rotation and a U(1) phase rotation. This result is verified numerically with the fermionic Laughlin state with $\nu=1/3$, $1/5$, as well as the non-Abelian Moore-Read state. Together with topological entanglement entropy, we prove that the expectation values of the partial rotation completely determines if a bosonic/fermionic Abelian topological order with U(1) symmetry has a symmetry-preserving gappable edge state or not. We also show that thermal and electric Hall conductivity of Abelian topological order can be extracted by partial rotations. Even in non-Abelian FQH states, partial rotation provides the Lieb-Schultz-Mattis type theorem constraining the low-energy spectrum of the bulk-boundary system. The generalization of higher Hall conductivity to the case with Lie group symmetry is also presented.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10814'&gt;arXiv:2404.10814&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 16 Apr 2024 18:00:00 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

Matveev, Ilya Tretyak&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We propose an efficient implementation of the numerical tensor-train (TT) based algorithm solving the multicomponent coagulation equation preserving the nonnegativeness of solution. Unnatural negative elements in the constructed approximation arise due to the errors of the low-rank decomposition and discretization scheme. In this work, we propose to apply the rank-one corrections in the TT-format proportional to the minimal negative element. Such an element can be found via application of the global optimization methods that can be fully implemented within efficient operations in the tensor train format. We incorporate this trick into the time-integration scheme for the multicomponent coagulation equation and also use it for post-processing of the stationary solution for the problem with the source of particles.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10898'&gt;arXiv:2404.10898&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 16 Apr 2024 20:39:44 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Discovering Factorization Surface of Quantum Spin Chains with Machine Learning</title>

Nonetheless, the tuning parameters indicating FS for several quantum spin models remain unknown. We employ symbolic regression (SR), a supervised learning technique, to determine a closed-form expression in the parameter regime corresponding to FS of quantum many-body Hamiltonians. We verify the effectiveness of this method by examining the analytically tractable models, namely a nearest-neighbor (NN) quantum transverse XY model with additional Kaplan-Shekhtman-Entin-Aharony interactions, for which the FS is well-known. We construct an accurate expression for the FS of the XYZ model by providing the parameter set through the SR algorithm in which the ground state is derived by matrix product state formalism. With a satisfactory level of accuracy, we estimate the FS for the long-range XY model, and the NN XY model with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya type asymmetric interaction for which the factorization surface is not known.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10910'&gt;arXiv:2404.10910&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 16 Apr 2024 21:10:05 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Spin and charge dynamics of doped one-dimensional Mott insulators</title>

On the other hand, long-range repulsive charge interactions were proposed to be crucial for understanding optical excitations of undoped 1D Mott insulators. Motivated by these contrasting proposals, we perform density-matrix renormalization group calculations of the single-particle spectral function as well as dynamical spin and charge structure factors for two kinds of extended 1D Hubbard models. The spectral function for the long-range repulsive model less agrees with the ARPES data as compared with that for the attractive one. The dynamical spin and charge structure factors also exhibit contrasting behaviors between the two models: the attractive model shows less momentum dependence of the integrated weight in the dynamical spin structure factor and more accumulation of the weight on the upper edge of particle-hole-type excitation in the dynamical charge structure factor. These features give a good criterion of an appropriate model for doped 1D Mott insulators, which can be judged by resonant-inelastic x-ray scattering experiments.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11412'&gt;arXiv:2404.11412&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 17 Apr 2024 14:13:38 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Daming Li&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Variational methods are highly valuable computational tools for solving high-dimensional quantum systems. In this paper, we explore the effectiveness of three variational methods: the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG), Boltzmann machine learning, and the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE). We apply these methods to two different quantum systems: the fermi-Hubbard model in condensed matter physics and the Schwinger model in high energy physics. To facilitate the computations on quantum computers, we map each model to a spin 1/2 system using the Jordan-Wigner transformation. This transformation allows us to take advantage of the capabilities of quantum computing. We calculate the ground state of both quantum systems and compare the results obtained using the three variational methods. By doing so, we aim to demonstrate the power and effectiveness of these variational approaches in tackling complex quantum systems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11490'&gt;arXiv:2404.11490&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 17 Apr 2024 15:46:27 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Entanglement Renormalization for Quantum Field Theories with Discrete Wavelet Transforms</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Daniele S. M. Alves&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We propose an adaptation of Entanglement Renormalization for quantum field theories that, through the use of discrete wavelet transforms, strongly parallels the tensor network architecture of the \emph{Multiscale Entanglement Renormalization Ansatz} (a.k.a. MERA). Our approach, called wMERA, has several advantages of over previous attempts to adapt MERA to continuum systems. In particular, (i) wMERA is formulated directly in position space, hence preserving the quasi-locality and sparsity of entanglers; and (ii) it enables a built-in RG flow in the implementation of real-time evolution and in computations of correlation functions, which is key for efficient numerical implementations. As examples, we describe in detail two concrete implementations of our wMERA algorithm for free scalar and fermionic theories in (1+1) spacetime dimensions. Possible avenues for constructing wMERAs for interacting field theories are also discussed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11715'&gt;arXiv:2404.11715&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 17 Apr 2024 20:01:51 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Tensor-Networks-based Learning of Probabilistic Cellular Automata Dynamics</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Heitor P. Casagrande, Bo Xing, William J. Munro, Chu Guo, Dario Poletti&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Algorithms developed to solve many-body quantum problems, like tensor networks, can turn into powerful quantum-inspired tools to tackle problems in the classical domain. In this work, we focus on matrix product operators, a prominent numerical technique to study many-body quantum systems, especially in one dimension. It has been previously shown that such a tool can be used for classification, learning of deterministic sequence-to-sequence processes and of generic quantum processes. We further develop a matrix product operator algorithm to learn probabilistic sequence-to-sequence processes and apply this algorithm to probabilistic cellular automata. This new approach can accurately learn probabilistic cellular automata processes in different conditions, even when the process is a probabilistic mixture of different chaotic rules. In addition, we find that the ability to learn these dynamics is a function of the bit-wise difference between the rules and whether one is much more likely than the other.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11768'&gt;arXiv:2404.11768&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 17 Apr 2024 21:51:03 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Quantum trajectory entanglement in various unravelings of Markovian dynamics</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12167</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Tatiana Vovk, Hannes Pichler&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The cost of classical simulations of quantum many-body dynamics is often determined by the amount of entanglement in the system. In this paper, we study entanglement in stochastic quantum trajectory approaches that solve master equations describing open quantum system dynamics. First, we introduce and compare adaptive trajectory unravelings of master equations. Specifically, building on Ref. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 128, 243601 (2022)], we study several greedy algorithms that generate trajectories with a low average entanglement entropy. Second, we consider various conventional unravelings of a one-dimensional open random Brownian circuit and locate the transition points from area- to volume-law-entangled trajectories. Third, we compare various trajectory unravelings using matrix product states with a direct integration of the master equation using matrix product operators. We provide concrete examples of dynamics, for which the simulation cost of stochastic trajectories is exponentially smaller than the one of matrix product operators.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12167'&gt;arXiv:2404.12167&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 18 Apr 2024 13:19:26 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Quasiparticle cooling algorithms for quantum many-body state preparation</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12175</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Jerome Lloyd, Alexios Michailidis, Xiao Mi, Vadim Smelyanskiy, Dmitry A. Abanin&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Probing correlated states of many-body systems is one of the central tasks for quantum simulators and processors. A promising approach to state preparation is to realize desired correlated states as steady states of engineered dissipative evolution. A recent experiment with a Google superconducting quantum processor [X. Mi et al., Science 383, 1332 (2024)] demonstrated a cooling algorithm utilizing auxiliary degrees of freedom that are periodically reset to remove quasiparticles from the system, thereby driving it towards its ground state. In this work, we develop a kinetic theory framework to describe quasiparticle cooling dynamics, and employ it to compare the efficiency of different cooling algorithms. In particular, we introduce a protocol where coupling to auxiliaries is modulated in time to minimize heating processes, and demonstrate that it allows a high-fidelity preparation of ground states in different quantum phases. We verify the validity of the kinetic theory description by an extensive comparison with numerical simulations for the examples of a 1d transverse-field Ising model, the transverse-field Ising model with an additional integrability-breaking field, and a non-integrable antiferromagnetic Heisenberg spin ladder. In all cases we are able to efficiently cool into the many-body ground state. The effects of noise, which limits efficiency of variational quantum algorithms in near-term quantum processors, are investigated through the lens of the kinetic theory: we show how the steady state quasiparticle populations depend on the noise rate, and we establish maximum noise values for achieving high-fidelity ground states. This work establishes quasiparticle cooling algorithms as a practical, robust method for many-body state preparation on near-term quantum processors.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12175'&gt;arXiv:2404.12175&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 18 Apr 2024 13:31:30 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Spin-1 Haldane chains of superconductor-semiconductor hybrids</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Virgil V. Baran, Jens Paaske&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We theoretically explore the possibility of realizing the symmetry-protected topological Haldane phase of spin-1 chains in a tunable hybrid platform of superconducting islands (SIs) and quantum dots (QDs). Inspired by recent findings suggesting that an appropriately tuned QD-SI-QD block may behave as a robust spin-1 unit, we study the behavior of many such units tunnel-coupled into linear chains. Our efficient and fully microscopic modeling of long chains with several tens of units is enabled by the use of the surrogate model solver [Phys. Rev. B 108, L220506 (2023); arXiv:2402.18357]. Our numerical findings indicate that the QD-SI-QD chains exhibit emblematic features of the Haldane phase, such as fractional spin-1/2 edge states and non-vanishing string order parameters, and that these persist over a sizeable region of parameter space.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12207'&gt;arXiv:2404.12207&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 18 Apr 2024 14:12:21 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

Matveev, Matvey Smirnov&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; In this work we provide theoretical estimates for the ranks of the power functions $f(k) = k^{-\alpha}$, $\alpha&gt;1$ in the quantized tensor train (QTT) format for $k = 1, 2, 3, \ldots, 2^{d}$. Such functions and their several generalizations (e.~g. $f(k) = k^{-\alpha} \cdot e^{-\lambda k}, \lambda &gt; 0$) play an important role in studies of the asymptotic solutions of the aggregation-fragmentation kinetic equations. In order to support the constructed theory we verify the values of QTT-ranks of these functions in practice with the use of the TTSVD procedure and show an agreement between the numerical and analytical results.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12230'&gt;arXiv:2404.12230&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 18 Apr 2024 14:47:42 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Gauged Gaussian PEPS -- A High Dimensional Tensor Network Formulation for Lattice Gauge Theories</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13123</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Ariel Kelman, Umberto Borla, Itay Gomelski, Jonathan Elyovich, Gertian Roose, Patrick Emonts, Erez Zohar&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Gauge theories form the basis of our understanding of modern physics - ranging from the description of quarks and gluons to effective models in condensed matter physics. In the non-perturbative regime, gauge theories are conventionally treated discretely as lattice gauge theories. The resulting systems are evaluated with path-integral based Monte Carlo methods. These methods, however, can suffer from the sign problem and do not allow for a direct evaluation of real-time dynamics. In this work, we present a unified and comprehensive framework for gauged Gaussian Projected Entangled Pair States (PEPS), a variational ansatz based on tensor networks. We review the construction of Hamiltonian lattice gauge theories, explain their similarities with PEPS, and detail the construction of the state. The estimation of ground states is based on a variational Monte Carlo procedure with the PEPS as an ansatz state. This sign-problem-free ansatz can be efficiently evaluated in any dimension with arbitrary gauge groups, and can include dynamical fermionic matter, suggesting new options for the simulation of non-perturbative regimes of gauge theories, including QCD.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13123'&gt;arXiv:2404.13123&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 19 Apr 2024 18:14:43 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

This formalism allows to use tensor network methods for fermionic lattice systems in a local way, avoiding the need of a Jordan-Wigner transformation or the explicit tracking of leg crossings by swap gates in 2D tensor networks. The graded Hilbert spaces can be readily integrated with other internal and lattice symmetries in tensor networks, and only require minor extensions to an existing tensor network software package. We review and benchmark the fermionic versions of common algorithms for matrix product states and projected entangled-pair states.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14611'&gt;arXiv:2404.14611&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 22 Apr 2024 22:22:05 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Tensor network analysis of the maple-leaf antiferromagnet spangolite</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14905</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Philipp Schmoll, Harald O. Jeschke, Yasir Iqbal&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Spangolite (Cu$_6$Al(SO$_4$)(OH)$_{12}$Cl$\cdot$3H$_2$O) is a hydroxy-hydrated copper sulfate mineral with a one-seventh depleted triangular lattice of Cu$^{2+}$ ions in each layer. Experimental measurements revealed a non-magnetic ground state at $T \sim 8\, \text{K}$ with magnetic properties dominated by dimerization. We propose a spatially anisotropic Heisenberg model for the Cu$^{2+}$ spin-$1/2$ degrees of freedom on this geometrically frustrated and effectively two-dimensional maple-leaf lattice, featuring five symmetry inequivalent couplings with ferromagnetic bonds on hexagons and antiferromagnetic triangular bonds. The validity of the proposed Hamiltonian is demonstrated by state-of-the-art tensor network calculations, which can assess both the nature of the ground state as well as low-temperature thermodynamics, including the effects of a magnetic field. We provide theoretical support for a picture of a non-trivially correlated dimer ground state, which accounts for the appreciable reduction of the magnetic moment at high temperatures observed in experiment, thereby resolving a long-standing puzzle. We predict the static spin structure factor as well as the emergence of magnetisation plateaus at high values of an external magnetic field, explore the nature of the quantum states in them, and study their melting with increasing temperature.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14905'&gt;arXiv:2404.14905&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 23 Apr 2024 10:40:17 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Tensor networks based quantum optimization algorithm</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15048</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; V. Akshay, Ar. Melnikov, A. Termanova, M. R. Perelshtein&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; In optimization, one of the well-known classical algorithms is power iterations. Simply stated, the algorithm recovers the dominant eigenvector of some diagonalizable matrix. Since numerous optimization problems can be formulated as an eigenvalue/eigenvector search, this algorithm features wide applicability. Operationally, power iterations consist of performing repeated matrix-to-vector multiplications (or MatVec) followed by a renormilization step in order to converge to the dominant eigenvalue/eigenvector. However, classical realizations, including novel tensor network based approaches, necessitate an exponential scaling for the algorithm's run-time. In this paper, we propose a quantum realiziation to circumvent this pitfall. Our methodology involves casting low-rank representations; Matrix Product Operators (MPO) for matrices and Matrix Product States (MPS) for vectors, into quantum circuits. Specifically, we recover a unitary approximation by variationally minimizing the Frobenius distance between a target MPO and an MPO ansatz wherein the tensor cores are constrained to unitaries. Such an unitary MPO can easily be implemented as a quantum circuit with the addition of ancillary qubits. Thereafter, with appropriate initialization and post-selection on the ancillary space, we realize a single iteration of the classical algorithm. With our proposed methodology, power iterations can be realized entirely on a quantum computer via repeated, static circuit blocks; therefore, a run-time advantage can indeed be guaranteed. Moreover, by exploiting Riemannian optimization and cross-approximation techniques, our methodology becomes instance agnostic and thus allows one to address black-box optimization within the framework of quantum computing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15048'&gt;arXiv:2404.15048&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 23 Apr 2024 13:49:11 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

Ignacio Cirac&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The propagation of errors severely compromises the reliability of quantum computations. The quantum adiabatic algorithm is a physically motivated method to prepare ground states of classical and quantum Hamiltonians. Here, we analyze the proliferation of a single error event in the adiabatic algorithm. We give numerical evidence using tensor network methods that the intrinsic properties of adiabatic processes effectively constrain the amplification of errors during the evolution for geometrically local Hamiltonians. Our findings indicate that low energy states could remain attainable even in the presence of a single error event, which contrasts with results for error propagation in typical quantum circuits.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15397'&gt;arXiv:2404.15397&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 23 Apr 2024 18:00:00 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Spectroscopy with the tensor renormalization group method</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15666</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Fathiyya Izzatun Az-zahra, Shinji Takeda, Takeshi Yamazaki&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We present a spectroscopy scheme for the lattice field theory by using the tensor renormalization group method combining with the transfer matrix formalism. By using the scheme, we cannot only compute the energy spectrum for the lattice theory but also determine quantum numbers of the energy eigenstates. Furthermore, the wave function of the corresponding eigenstate can also be computed. The first step of the scheme is to coarse grain the tensor network of a given lattice model by using the higher order tensor renormalization group, and then after making a matrix corresponding to a transfer matrix from the coarse-grained tensors, its eigenvalues are evaluated to extract the energy spectrum. Second, the quantum number of the eigenstates can be identified by a selection rule that requires to compute matrix elements of an associated insertion operator. The matrix elements can be represented by an impurity tensor network and computed by the coarse-graining scheme. Moreover, we can compute the wave function of the energy eigenstate by putting the impurity tensor at each point in space direction of the network. Additionally, the momentum of the eigenstate can also be identified by computing appropriate matrix elements represented by the tensor network. As a demonstration of the new scheme, we show the spectroscopy of the $(1+1)$d Ising model and compare it with exact results. We also present a scattering phase shift obtained from two-particle state energy using Lüscher's formula.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15666'&gt;arXiv:2404.15666&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 24 Apr 2024 05:52:41 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Non-onsite symmetries and quantum teleportation in split-index matrix product states</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15883</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; David T. Stephen&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We describe a class of spin chains with new physical and computational properties. On the physical side, the spin chains give examples of symmetry-protected topological phases that are defined by non-onsite symmetries, i.e. symmetries that are not a tensor product of single-site operators. These phases can be detected by string-order parameters, but notably do not exhibit entanglement spectrum degeneracy. On the computational side, the spin chains represent a new class of states that can be used to deterministically teleport information across long distances, with the novel property that the necessary classical side processing is a non-linear function of the measurement outcomes. We also give examples of states that can serve as universal resources for measurement-based quantum computation, providing the first examples of such resources without entanglement spectrum degeneracy. The key tool in our analysis is a new kind of tensor network representation which we call split-index matrix product states (SIMPS). We develop the basic formalism of SIMPS, compare them to matrix product states, show how they are better equipped to describe certain kinds of non-onsite symmetries including anomalous symmetries, and discuss how they are also well-suited to describing quantum teleportation and constrained spin chains.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15883'&gt;arXiv:2404.15883&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 24 Apr 2024 14:04:10 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Double Magnon-Roton Excitations in the Triangular-Lattice Spin Supersolid</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15997</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Yuan Gao, Chuandi Zhang, Junsen Xiang, Dehong Yu, Xingye Lu, Peijie Sun, Wentao Jin, Gang Su, Wei Li&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Supersolid is an exotic quantum state of matter that spontaneously hosts the features of both solid and superfluid, which breaks the translation and U(1) gauge symmetries. Here we study the spin dynamics in the triangular-lattice compound Na$_2$BaCo(PO$_4$)$_2$, which is revealed in [Xiang et al., Nature 625, 270-275 (2024)] as a quantum magnetic analog of supersolid. We simulate the easy-axis Heisenberg model with tensor network approach and uncover unique dynamic traits. These features are manifested in two branches of excitations that can be associated with the spin solidity and superfluidity, respectively. One branch contains the U(1) Goldstone and roton modes, while the other comprises pseudo-Goldstone and roton modes. The gapless Goldstone modes of the in-plane superfluid order are confirmed by our inelastic neutron scattering measurements. Together with the evident out-of-plane solid order indicated by the magnetic Bragg peaks, our findings provide spectroscopic evidence for spin supersolidity in this easy-axis antiferromagnet. Akin to the role of phonon-roton modes -- Landau elementary excitations -- in shaping the helium superfluid thermodynamics, the intriguing double magnon-roton dispersion here determines the low-temperature thermodynamics of spin supersolid down to sub-Kelvin regime, explaining the recently observed giant magnetocaloric effect in Na$_2$BaCo(PO$_4$)$_2$.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15997'&gt;arXiv:2404.15997&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 24 Apr 2024 17:16:11 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Benchmarking a heuristic Floquet adiabatic algorithm for the Max-Cut problem</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16001</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Etienne Granet, Henrik Dreyer&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; According to the adiabatic theorem of quantum mechanics, a system initially in the ground state of a Hamiltonian remains in the ground state if one slowly changes the Hamiltonian. This can be used in principle to solve hard problems on quantum computers. Generically, however, implementation of this Hamiltonian dynamics on digital quantum computers requires scaling Trotter step size with system size and simulation time, which incurs a large gate count. In this work, we argue that for classical optimization problems, the adiabatic evolution can be performed with a fixed, finite Trotter step. This "Floquet adiabatic evolution" reduces by several orders of magnitude the gate count compared to the usual, continuous-time adiabatic evolution. We give numerical evidence using matrix-product-state simulations that it can optimally solve the Max-Cut problem on $3$-regular graphs in a large number of instances, with surprisingly low runtime, even with bond dimensions as low as $D=2$. Extrapolating our numerical results, we estimate the resources needed for a quantum computer to compete with classical exact or approximate solvers for this specific problem.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16001'&gt;arXiv:2404.16001&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 24 Apr 2024 17:29:03 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Constant-depth preparation of matrix product states with adaptive quantum circuits</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16083</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Kevin C. Smith, Abid Khan, Bryan K. Clark, S. M. Girvin, Tzu-Chieh Wei&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Adaptive quantum circuits, which combine local unitary gates, midcircuit measurements, and feedforward operations, have recently emerged as a promising avenue for efficient state preparation, particularly on near-term quantum devices limited to shallow-depth circuits. Matrix product states (MPS) comprise a significant class of many-body entangled states, efficiently describing the ground states of one-dimensional gapped local Hamiltonians and finding applications in a number of recent quantum algorithms. Recently, it was shown that the AKLT state -- a paradigmatic example of an MPS -- can be exactly prepared with an adaptive quantum circuit of constant-depth, an impossible feat with local unitary gates due to its nonzero correlation length [Smith et al., PRX Quantum 4, 020315 (2023)]. In this work, we broaden the scope of this approach and demonstrate that a diverse class of MPS can be exactly prepared using constant-depth adaptive quantum circuits, outperforming optimal preparation protocols that rely on unitary circuits alone. We show that this class includes short- and long-ranged entangled MPS, symmetry-protected topological (SPT) and symmetry-broken states, MPS with finite Abelian, non-Abelian, and continuous symmetries, resource states for MBQC, and families of states with tunable correlation length. Moreover, we illustrate the utility of our framework for designing constant-depth sampling protocols, such as for random MPS or for generating MPS in a particular SPT phase. We present sufficient conditions for particular MPS to be preparable in constant time, with global on-site symmetry playing a pivotal role. Altogether, this work demonstrates the immense promise of adaptive quantum circuits for efficiently preparing many-body entangled states and provides explicit algorithms that outperform known protocols to prepare an essential class of states.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16083'&gt;arXiv:2404.16083&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 24 Apr 2024 18:00:00 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Statistical Mechanics of Stochastic Quantum Control: $d$-adic Rényi Circuits</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16087</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Andrew A. Allocca, Conner LeMaire, Thomas Iadecola, Justin H. Wilson&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The dynamics of quantum information in many-body systems with large onsite Hilbert space dimension admits an enlightening description in terms of effective statistical mechanics models. Motivated by this fact, we reveal a connection between three separate models: the classically chaotic $d$-adic R\'{e}nyi map with stochastic control, a quantum analog of this map for qudits, and a Potts model on a random graph. The classical model and its quantum analog share a transition between chaotic and controlled phases, driven by a randomly applied control map that attempts to order the system. In the quantum model, the control map necessitates measurements that concurrently drive a phase transition in the entanglement content of the late-time steady state. To explore the interplay of the control and entanglement transitions, we derive an effective Potts model from the quantum model and use it to probe information-theoretic quantities that witness both transitions. The entanglement transition is found to be in the bond-percolation universality class, consistent with other measurement-induced phase transitions, while the control transition is governed by a classical random walk. These two phase transitions merge as a function of model parameters, consistent with behavior observed in previous small-size numerical studies of the quantum model.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16087'&gt;arXiv:2404.16087&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 24 Apr 2024 18:00:00 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>A Generalised Haldane Map from the Matrix Product State Path Integral to the Critical Theory of the $J_1$-$J_2$ Chain</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16088</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; F. Azad, Adam J. McRoberts, Chris Hooley, A. G. Green&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We study the $J_1$-$J_2$ spin-$1/2$ chain using a path integral constructed over matrix product states (MPS). By virtue of its non-trivial entanglement structure, the MPS ansatz captures the key phases of the model even at a semi-classical, saddle-point level, and, as a variational state, is in good agreement with the field theory obtained by abelian bosonisation. Going beyond the semi-classical level, we show that the MPS ansatz facilitates a physically-motivated derivation of the field theory of the critical phase: by carefully taking the continuum limit -- a generalisation of the Haldane map -- we recover from the MPS path integral a field theory with the correct topological term and emergent $SO(4)$ symmetry, constructively linking the microscopic states and topological field-theoretic structures. Moreover, the dimerisation transition is particularly clear in the MPS formulation -- an explicit dimerisation potential becomes relevant, gapping out the magnetic fluctuations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16088'&gt;arXiv:2404.16088&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 24 Apr 2024 18:00:00 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Two qubit gate with macroscopic singlet-triplet qubits in synthetic spin-one chains in InAsP quantum dot nanowires</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16229</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Hassan Allami, Daniel Miravet, Marek Korkusinski, Pawel Hawrylak&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We present a theory of a two qubit gate with macroscopic singlet-triplet (ST) qubits in synthetic spin-one chains in InAsP quantum dot nanowires. The macroscopic topologically protected singlet-triplet qubits are built with two spin-half Haldane quasiparticles. The Haldane quasiparticles are hosted by synthetic spin-one chain realized in chains of InAsP quantum dots embedded in an InP nanowire, with four electrons each. The quantum dot nanowire is described by a Hubbard-Kanamori (HK) Hamiltonian derived from an interacting atomistic model. Using exact diagonalization and Matrix Product States (MPS) tools, we demonstrate that the low-energy behavior of the HK Hamiltonian is effectively captured by an antiferromagnetic spin-one chain Hamiltonian. Next we consider two macroscopic qubits and present a method for creating a tunable coupling between the two macroscopic qubits by inserting an intermediate control dot between the two chains. Finally, we propose and demonstrate two approaches for generating highly accurate two-ST qubit gates : (1) by controlling the length of each qubit, and (2) by employing different background magnetic fields for the two qubits.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16229'&gt;arXiv:2404.16229&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 24 Apr 2024 22:03:39 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Preparing matrix product states via fusion: constraints and extensions</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16360</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; David T. Stephen, Oliver Hart&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; In the era of noisy, intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices, the efficient preparation of many-body resource states is a task of paramount importance. In this paper we focus on the deterministic preparation of matrix-product states (MPS) in constant depth by utilizing measurements and classical communication to fuse smaller states into larger ones. We place strong constraints on the MPS that can be prepared using this method, which we refer to as MPS fusion. Namely, we establish that it is necessary for the MPS to have a flat entanglement spectrum. Using the recently introduced split-index MPS (SIMPS) representation, we then introduce a family of states that belong to interesting phases of matter protected by non-onsite symmetries and serve as resources for long-range quantum teleportation, but which lie beyond the scope of ordinary MPS fusion. It is shown constructively that these states can be prepared in constant depth using a broader class of measurement-assisted protocols, which we dub SIMPS fusion. Even in cases when MPS fusion is possible, using SIMPS fusion can give rise to significantly reduced resource overhead. Our results therefore simultaneously establish the boundaries of conventional MPS fusion and push the envelope of which states can be prepared using measurement-assisted protocols.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16360'&gt;arXiv:2404.16360&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 25 Apr 2024 06:42:01 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Optimal depth and a novel approach to variational quantum process tomography</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16541</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Vladlen Galetsky, Pol Julià Farré, Soham Ghosh, Christian Deppe, Roberto Ferrara&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; In this work, we present two new methods for Variational Quantum Circuit (VQC) Process Tomography onto $n$ qubits systems: PT_VQC and U-VQSVD. Compared to the state of the art, PT_VQC halves in each run the required amount of qubits for process tomography and decreases the required state initializations from $4^{n}$ to just $2^{n}$, all while ensuring high-fidelity reconstruction of the targeted unitary channel $U$. It is worth noting that, for a fixed reconstruction accuracy, PT_VQC achieves faster convergence per iteration step compared to Quantum Deep Neural Network (QDNN) and tensor network schemes. The novel U-VQSVD algorithm utilizes variational singular value decomposition to extract eigenvectors (up to a global phase) and their associated eigenvalues from an unknown unitary representing a general channel. We assess the performance of U-VQSVD by executing an attack on a non-unitary channel Quantum Physical Unclonable Function (QPUF). U-VQSVD outperforms an uninformed impersonation attack (using randomly generated input states) by a factor of 2 to 5, depending on the qubit dimension. For the two presented methods, we propose a new approach to calculate the complexity of the displayed VQC, based on what we denote as optimal depth.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16541'&gt;arXiv:2404.16541&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 25 Apr 2024 11:58:06 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Classifying One-Dimensional Quantum States Prepared by a Single Round of Measurements</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16753</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Rahul Sahay, Ruben Verresen&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Measurements and feedback have emerged as powerful resources for creating many-body quantum states. However, a detailed understanding has been restricted to fixed-point representatives of phases of matter. Here, we go beyond this and characterize the patterns of many-body entanglement that can be deterministically created from measurement. Focusing on one spatial dimension, a framework is developed for the case where a single round of measurements is the only entangling operation. We show this creates matrix product states and identify necessary and sufficient tensor conditions for preparability, which uniquely determine the preparation protocol. We use these conditions to both classify preparable quantum states and characterize their physical constraints. In particular, we find a trade-off between the richness of the preparable entanglement spectrum and correlation functions, which leads to a no-go theorem for preparing certain quantum states. More broadly, we connect properties of the preparation protocol to the resulting phase of matter, including trivial, symmetry-breaking, and symmetry-protected topological phases -- for both uniform and modulated symmetries. This work offers a resource-theoretic perspective on preparable quantum entanglement and shows how to systematically create states of matter, away from their fixed points, in quantum devices.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16753'&gt;arXiv:2404.16753&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 25 Apr 2024 17:10:22 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Pseudogap phase as fluctuating pair density wave</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Zheng-Yuan Yue, Zheng-Tao Xu, Shuo Yang, Zheng-Cheng Gu&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The physical nature of pseudogap phase is one of the most important and intriguing problems towards understanding the key mechanism of high temperature superconductivity in cuprates. Theoretically, the square-lattice $t$-$J$ model is widely believed to be the simplest toy model that captures the essential physics of cuprate superconductors. We employ the Grassmann tensor product state approach to investigate uniform states in the underdoped ($\delta \lesssim 0.1$) region. In addition to the previously known uniform $d$-wave state, we discover a strongly fluctuating pair density wave (PDW) state with wave vector $Q = (\pi, \pi)$. This fluctuating PDW state weakly breaks the $C_4$ rotational symmetry of the square lattice and has a lower or comparable energy to the $d$-wave state (depending on doping and the $t/J$ ratio), making it a promising candidate state for describing the pseudogap phase.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16770'&gt;arXiv:2404.16770&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 25 Apr 2024 17:23:31 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Dual-isometric Projected Entangled Pair States</title>

Ignacio Cirac, Pavel Kos, Georgios Styliaris&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Efficient characterization of higher dimensional many-body physical states presents significant challenges. In this paper, we propose a new class of Project Entangled Pair State (PEPS) that incorporates two isometric conditions. This new class facilitates the efficient calculation of general local observables and certain two-point correlation functions, which have been previously shown to be intractable for general PEPS, or PEPS with only a single isometric constraint. Despite incorporating two isometric conditions, our class preserves the rich physical structure while enhancing the analytical capabilities. It features a large set of tunable parameters, with only a subleading correction compared to that of general PEPS. Furthermore, we analytically demonstrate that this class can encode universal quantum computations and can represent a transition from topological to trivial order.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16783'&gt;arXiv:2404.16783&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 25 Apr 2024 17:31:31 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Finite-Depth Preparation of Tensor Network States from Measurement</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Rahul Sahay, Ruben Verresen&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Although tensor network states constitute a broad range of exotic quantum states, their realization is challenging and often requires resources whose depth scales with system size. In this work, we explore criteria on the local tensors for enabling deterministic state preparation via a single round of measurements and on-site unitary feedback. We use these criteria to construct families of measurement-preparable states in one and two dimensions, tuning between distinct symmetry-breaking, symmetry-protected, and intrinsic topological phases of matter. For instance, in one dimension we chart out a three-parameter family of preparable states which interpolate between the AKLT, cluster, GHZ and other states of interest. Our protocol even allows one to engineer preparable quantum states with a range of desired correlation lengths and entanglement properties. In addition to such constructive approaches, we present diagnostics for verifying whether a given tensor network state is preparable using measurements. We conclude by charting out generalizations, such as considering multiple rounds of measurements, implementing matrix product operators, and using incomplete basis measurements.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17087'&gt;arXiv:2404.17087&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 26 Apr 2024 00:37:00 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Quantum and classical correlations in shrinking algorithms for optimization</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17242</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Victor Fischer, Maximilian Passek, Friedrich Wagner, Jernej Rudi Finžgar, Lilly Palackal, Christian B. Mendl&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Understanding the benefits of quantum computing for solving combinatorial optimization problems (COPs) remains an open research question. In this work, we extend and analyze algorithms that solve COPs by recursively shrinking them. The algorithms leverage correlations between variables extracted from quantum or classical subroutines to recursively simplify the problem. We compare the performance of the algorithms equipped with correlations from the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) as well as the classical linear programming (LP) and semi-definite programming (SDP) relaxations. This allows us to benchmark the utility of QAOA correlations against established classical relaxation algorithms. We apply the recursive algorithm to MaxCut problem instances with up to a hundred vertices at different graph densities. Our results indicate that LP outperforms all other approaches for low-density instances, while SDP excels for high-density problems. Moreover, the shrinking algorithm proves to be a viable alternative to established methods of rounding LP and SDP relaxations. In addition, the recursive shrinking algorithm outperforms its bare counterparts for all three types of correlations, i.e., LP with spanning tree rounding, the Goemans-Williamson algorithm, and conventional QAOA. While the lowest depth QAOA consistently yields worse results than the SDP, our tensor network experiments show that the performance increases significantly for deeper QAOA circuits.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17242'&gt;arXiv:2404.17242&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 26 Apr 2024 08:29:04 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

We calculate the exact spin dynamics by mapping onto a system of non-interacting fermions, averaging over the distribution of holes. At small hole densities we find that the helical spin pattern decays exponentially, with a pitch dependence that agrees with the experiments. At large hole densities we instead find persistent oscillations. While our analytic approach does not generalize to the $XXZ$ model with arbitrary anisotropies, we validate a matrix product state technique which might be used to model the experiments in those settings.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17558'&gt;arXiv:2404.17558&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 26 Apr 2024 17:36:27 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Exploiting many-body localization for scalable variational quantum simulation</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Chenfeng Cao, Yeqing Zhou, Swamit Tannu, Nic Shannon, Robert Joynt&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) represent a promising pathway toward achieving practical quantum advantage on near-term hardware. Despite this promise, for generic, expressive ansatze, their scalability is critically hindered by barren plateaus--regimes of exponentially vanishing gradients. We demonstrate that initializing a hardware-efficient, Floquet-structured Ansatz within the many-body localized (MBL) phase mitigates barren plateaus and enhances algorithmic trainability. Through analysis of the inverse participation ratio, entanglement entropy, and a novel low-weight stabilizer Rényi entropy, we characterize a distinct MBL-thermalization transition. Below a critical kick strength, the circuit avoids forming a unitary 2-design, exhibits robust area-law entanglement, and maintains non-vanishing gradients. Leveraging this MBL regime facilitates the efficient variational preparation of ground states for several model Hamiltonians with significantly reduced computational resources. Crucially, experiments on IBM's 127-qubit Brisbane processor provide evidence for the preservation of trainable gradients in the MBL phase for a kicked Heisenberg chain, validating our approach on contemporary noisy hardware. Our findings position MBL-based initialization as a viable strategy for developing scalable VQAs and motivate the broader integration of localization phenomena into quantum algorithm design.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17560'&gt;arXiv:2404.17560&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 26 Apr 2024 17:40:20 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional correlation propagation dynamics with a cluster discrete phase-space method</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18594</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Kazuma Nagao, Seiji Yunoki&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Nonequilibrium dynamics of highly-controlled quantum systems is a challenging issue in statistical physics and quantum many-body physics, relevant to recent experimental developments of analog and digital quantum simulations. In this work, we develop a discrete phase-space approach for general SU($N$) spin systems that utilizes cluster mean field equations, which capture non-trivial quantum correlations inside each cluster, beyond the capability of the standard discrete truncated Wigner approximation for individual classical spins. Our formalism, based on a cluster phase-point operator, enables efficient numerical samplings of cluster phase-space variables, where the total number of noise variables for a direct product state is independent of the specific way in which the entire system is divided into multiple equally sized finite clusters. We numerically demonstrate that the cluster discrete truncated Wigner approximation (C-dTWA) method can reproduce key results in a recent experiment on correlation propagation dynamics in a two dimensional Bose-Hubbard system. We further compare the results of C-dTWA for clusters of $2\times 2$ sites with those from a two-dimensional tensor network method and discuss that both approaches agree very well in the short-time region, where the energy conservation is well maintained in the tensor network simulations. Since we formulate the C-dTWA method in a general form, it has the potential for application to various dynamical problems in isolated and open quantum systems, even in higher dimensions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18594'&gt;arXiv:2404.18594&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 29 Apr 2024 11:08:44 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Tensor cumulants for statistical inference on invariant distributions</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18735</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Dmitriy Kunisky, Cristopher Moore, Alexander S. Wein&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Many problems in high-dimensional statistics appear to have a statistical-computational gap: a range of values of the signal-to-noise ratio where inference is information-theoretically possible, but (conjecturally) computationally intractable. A canonical such problem is Tensor PCA, where we observe a tensor $Y$ consisting of a rank-one signal plus Gaussian noise. Multiple lines of work suggest that Tensor PCA becomes computationally hard at a critical value of the signal's magnitude. In particular, below this transition, no low-degree polynomial algorithm can detect the signal with high probability; conversely, various spectral algorithms are known to succeed above this transition. We unify and extend this work by considering tensor networks, orthogonally invariant polynomials where multiple copies of $Y$ are "contracted" to produce scalars, vectors, matrices, or other tensors. We define a new set of objects, tensor cumulants, which provide an explicit, near-orthogonal basis for invariant polynomials of a given degree. This basis lets us unify and strengthen previous results on low-degree hardness, giving a combinatorial explanation of the hardness transition and of a continuum of subexponential-time algorithms that work below it, and proving tight lower bounds against low-degree polynomials for recovering rather than just detecting the signal. It also lets us analyze a new problem of distinguishing between different tensor ensembles, such as Wigner and Wishart tensors, establishing a sharp computational threshold and giving evidence of a new statistical-computational gap in the Central Limit Theorem for random tensors. Finally, we believe these cumulants are valuable mathematical objects in their own right: they generalize the free cumulants of free probability theory from matrices to tensors, and share many of their properties, including additivity under additive free convolution.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18735'&gt;arXiv:2404.18735&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 29 Apr 2024 14:33:24 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Quantum State Designs with Clifford Enhanced Matrix Product States</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18751</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Guglielmo Lami, Tobias Haug, Jacopo De Nardis&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Nonstabilizerness, or `magic', is a critical quantum resource that, together with entanglement, characterizes the non-classical complexity of quantum states. Here, we address the problem of quantifying the average nonstabilizerness of random Matrix Product States (RMPS). RMPS represent a generalization of random product states featuring bounded entanglement that scales logarithmically with the bond dimension $\chi$. We demonstrate that the $2$-Stabilizer Rényi Entropy converges to that of Haar random states as $N/\chi^2$, where $N$ is the system size. This indicates that MPS with a modest bond dimension are as magical as generic states. Subsequently, we introduce the ensemble of Clifford enhanced Matrix Product States ($\mathcal{C}$MPS), built by the action of Clifford unitaries on RMPS. Leveraging our previous result, we show that $\mathcal{C}$MPS can approximate $4$-spherical designs with arbitrary accuracy. Specifically, for a constant $N$, $\mathcal{C}$MPS become close to $4$-designs with a scaling as $\chi^{-2}$. Our findings indicate that combining Clifford unitaries with polynomially complex tensor network states can generate highly non-trivial quantum states.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18751'&gt;arXiv:2404.18751&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 29 Apr 2024 14:50:06 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Non-stabilizerness versus entanglement in matrix product states</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18768</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; M. Frau, P. S. Tarabunga, M. Collura, M. Dalmonte, E. Tirrito&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; In this paper, we investigate the relationship between entanglement and non-stabilizerness (also known as magic) in matrix product states (MPSs). We study the relation between magic and the bond dimension used to approximate the ground state of a many-body system in two different contexts: full state of magic and mutual magic (the non-stabilizer analogue of mutual information, thus free of boundary effects) of spin-1 anisotropic Heisenberg chains. Our results indicate that obtaining converged results for non-stabilizerness is typically considerably easier than entanglement. For full state magic at critical points and at sufficiently large volumes, we observe convergence with $1/\chi^2$, with $\chi$ being the MPS bond dimension. At small volumes, magic saturation is so quick that, within error bars, we cannot appreciate any finite-$\chi$ correction. Mutual magic also shows a fast convergence with bond dimension, whose specific functional form is however hindered by sampling errors. As a by-product of our study, we show how Pauli-Markov chains (originally formulated to evaluate magic) resets the state of the art in terms of computing mutual information for MPS. We illustrate this last fact by verifying the logarithmic increase of mutual information between connected partitions at critical points. By comparing mutual information and mutual magic, we observe that, for connected partitions, the latter is typically scaling much slower - if at all - with the partition size, while for disconnected partitions, both are constant in size.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18768'&gt;arXiv:2404.18768&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 29 Apr 2024 15:03:40 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Sign problem in tensor network contraction</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19023</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Jielun Chen, Jiaqing Jiang, Dominik Hangleiter, Norbert Schuch&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We investigate how the computational difficulty of contracting tensor networks depends on the sign structure of the tensor entries. Using results from computational complexity, we observe that the approximate contraction of tensor networks with only positive entries has lower complexity. This raises the question how this transition in computational complexity manifests itself in the hardness of different contraction schemes. We pursue this question by studying random tensor networks with varying bias towards positive entries. First, we consider contraction via Monte Carlo sampling, and find that the transition from hard to easy occurs when the entries become predominantly positive; this can be seen as a tensor network manifestation of the Quantum Monte Carlo sign problem. Second, we analyze the commonly used contraction based on boundary tensor networks. Its performance is governed by the amount of correlations (entanglement) in the tensor network. Remarkably, we find that the transition from hard to easy (i.e., from a volume law to a boundary law scaling of entanglement) occurs already for a slight bias towards a positive mean, and the earlier the larger the bond dimension is. This is in contrast to both expectations and the behavior found in Monte Carlo contraction. We gain further insight into this early transition from the study of an effective statmech model. Finally, we investigate the computational difficulty of computing expectation values of tensor network wavefunctions, i.e., PEPS, where we find that the complexity of entanglement-based contraction always remains low. We explain this by providing a local transformation which maps PEPS expectation values to a positive-valued tensor network. This not only provides insight into the origin of the observed boundary law entanglement scaling, but also suggests new approaches towards PEPS contraction based on positive decompositions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19023'&gt;arXiv:2404.19023&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 29 Apr 2024 18:06:38 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

Multi-configurational models are therefore essential to establish universally applicable, predictive ab initio methods for chemistry. Here, we present a discussion of explicit correlation approaches which address the nagging problem of dealing with static and dynamic electron correlation in multi-configurational active-space approaches. We review the latest developments and then point to their key obstacles. Our discussion is supported by new data obtained with tensor network methods. We argue in favor of simple electrons-only correlator expressions that may allow one to define transcorrelated models in which the correlator does not bear a dependence on molecular structure.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19172'&gt;arXiv:2404.19172&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 30 Apr 2024 00:34:34 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Boundary effect and quantum phases in spin chains</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Jinhyeok Ryu, Jaeyoon Cho&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Boundary effect is a widespread idea in many-body theories. However, it is more of a conceptual notion than a rigorously defined physical quantity. One can quantify the boundary effect by comparing two ground states of the same physical model, which differ only slightly in system size. Here, we analyze the quantity, which we call a boundary effect function, for an XXZ spin-1/2 model using density matrix renormalization group calculations. We find that three quantum phases of the model manifest as different functional forms of the boundary effect function. As a result, the quantum phase transition of the model is associated with a nonanalytic change of the boundary effect function. This work thus provides and concretizes a novel perspective on the relationship between bulk and boundary properties of ground states.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19588'&gt;arXiv:2404.19588&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 30 Apr 2024 14:26:14 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Type II t-J model in charge transfer regime in bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and trilayer La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00092</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Hanbit Oh, Boran Zhou, Ya-Hui Zhang&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Recent observations of an 80 K superconductor in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under high pressure have attracted significant attention. Recent experiments indicate that La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ may be in the charge transfer regime, challenging the previous models based purely on the Ni $d_{x^2-y^2}$ and $d_{z^2}$ orbitals. In this study, we propose a low energy model that incorporates doped holes in the oxygen $p$ orbitals. Given that the parent nickel state is in the $3d^{8}$ configuration with a spin-one moment, doped hole only screens it down to spin-half, in contrast to the Zhang-Rice singlet in cuprate. We dub the single hole state as Zhang-Rice spin-half and build an effective model which includes three spin-one states ($d^8$) and two Zhang-Rice spin-half states ($d^8 L$). At moderate pressure around $20$ GPa, the dominated oxygen orbital is an in-plane Wannier orbital with the same lattice symmetry as the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital. The resulting model reduces to the bilayer type II t-J model previously proposed in the Mott-Hubbard regime. Notably, the hopping between the in-plane $p$ orbitals of the two layers is still suppressed. Density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulation reveals a pairing dome with the optimal hole doping level at $x=0.4\sim0.5$, distinct from the hole doped cuprate where optimal doping occurs around $x=0.19$. Further increasing pressure initially raises the critical temperature ($T_c$) until reaching an optimal pressure beyond which the $p_z$ orbital of oxygen becomes favorable and superconductivity is diminished. This shift from in-plane $p$ orbital to $p_z$ orbital may elucidate the experimentally observed superconducting dome with varying pressure. As an extension, we also suggest a trilayer version of the type II t-J model as the minimal model for pressured La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$, which is distinct from the models in the Mott-Hubbard regime.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00092'&gt;arXiv:2405.00092&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 30 Apr 2024 18:00:01 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Optimized Distribution of Entanglement Graph States in Quantum Networks</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00222</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Xiaojie Fan, Caitao Zhan, Himanshu Gupta, C. R. Ramakrishnan&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Building large-scale quantum computers, essential to demonstrating quantum advantage, is a key challenge. Quantum Networks (QNs) can help address this challenge by enabling the construction of large, robust, and more capable quantum computing platforms by connecting smaller quantum computers. Moreover, unlike classical systems, QNs can enable fully secured long-distance communication. Thus, quantum networks lie at the heart of the success of future quantum information technologies. In quantum networks, multipartite entangled states distributed over the network help implement and support many quantum network applications for communications, sensing, and computing. Our work focuses on developing optimal techniques to generate and distribute multipartite entanglement states efficiently. Prior works on generating general multipartite entanglement states have focused on the objective of minimizing the number of maximally entangled pairs (EPs) while ignoring the heterogeneity of the network nodes and links as well as the stochastic nature of underlying processes. In this work, we develop a hypergraph based linear programming framework that delivers optimal (under certain assumptions) generation schemes for general multipartite entanglement represented by graph states, under the network resources, decoherence, and fidelity constraints, while considering the stochasticity of the underlying processes. We illustrate our technique by developing generation schemes for the special cases of path and tree graph states, and discuss optimized generation schemes for more general classes of graph states. Using extensive simulations over a quantum network simulator (NetSquid), we demonstrate the effectiveness of our developed techniques and show that they outperform prior known schemes by up to orders of magnitude.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00222'&gt;arXiv:2405.00222&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 30 Apr 2024 22:00:25 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Fractional domain wall statistics in spin chains with anomalous symmetries</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Jose Garre Rubio, Norbert Schuch&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We study the statistics of domain wall excitations in quantum spin chains. We focus on systems with finite symmetry groups represented by matrix product unitaries (MPUs), i.e. finite depth quantum circuits. Such symmetries can be anomalous, in which case gapped phases which they support must break the symmetry. The lowest lying excitations of those systems are thus domain wall excitations. We investigate the behavior of these domain walls under exchange, and find that they can exhibit non-trivial exchange statistics. This statistics is completely determined by the anomaly of the symmetry, and we provide a direct relation between the known classification of MPU symmetry actions on ground states and the domain wall statistics. Already for the simplest case of a $\mathbb Z_2$ symmetry, we obtain that the presence of an anomalous MPU symmetry gives rise to domain wall excitations which behave neither as bosons nor as fermions, but rather exhibit fractional statistics. Finally, we show that the exchange statistics of domain walls is a physically accessible quantity, by devising explicit measurement operators through which it can be determined.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00439'&gt;arXiv:2405.00439&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 01 May 2024 10:45:01 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

To obtain a reduced density matrix that is block-diagonal in the non-abelian charges, we define subsystems operationally in terms of subalgebras of invariant observables. We derive exact formulas for the average and the variance of the typical entanglement entropy for the ensemble of random pure states with fixed non-abelian charges. We focus on compact, semisimple Lie groups. We show that, compared to the abelian case, new phenomena arise from the interplay of locality and non-abelian symmetry, such as the asymmetry of the entanglement entropy under subsystem exchange, which we show in detail by computing the Page curve of a many-body system with SU(2) symmetry.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00597'&gt;arXiv:2405.00597&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 01 May 2024 16:06:48 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Learning parameter dependence for Fourier-based option pricing with tensor trains</title>

A recent study has proposed to use tensor train learning algorithms to speed up Fourier transform (FT)-based option pricing, utilizing the ability of tensor trains to compress high-dimensional tensors. Another usage of the tensor train is to compress functions, including their parameter dependence. Here, we propose a pricing method, where, by a tensor train learning algorithm, we build tensor trains that approximate functions appearing in FT-based option pricing with their parameter dependence and efficiently calculate the option price for the varying input parameters. As a benchmark test, we run the proposed method to price a multi-asset option for the various values of volatilities and present asset prices. We show that, in the tested cases involving up to 11 assets, the proposed method outperforms Monte Carlo-based option pricing with $10^6$ paths in terms of computational complexity while keeping better accuracy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00701'&gt;arXiv:2405.00701&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 17 Apr 2024 01:57:19 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Nonperturbative signatures of fractons in the twisted multiflavor Schwinger Model</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Pavel P. Popov, Valentin Kasper, Maciej Lewenstein, Erez Zohar, Paolo Stornati, Philipp Hauke&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Gauge-field configurations with nontrivial topology have profound consequences for the physics of Abelian and non-Abelian gauge theories. Over time, arguments have been gathering for the existence of gauge-field configurations with fractional topological charge, called fractons. Ground-state properties of gauge theories can drastically change in presence of fractons in the path integral. However, understanding the origin of such fractons is usually restricted to semiclassical argumentation. Here, we show that fractons persist in strongly correlated many-body systems, using the multiflavor Schwinger model of quantum electrodynamics as a paradigm example. Through detailed numerical tensor-network analysis, we find strong fracton signatures even in highly discretized lattice models, at sizes that are implementable on already existing quantum-simulation devices. Our work sheds light on how the nontrivial topology of gauge theories persists in challenging nonperturbative regimes, and it shows a path forward to probing it in tabletop experiments.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00745'&gt;arXiv:2405.00745&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 30 Apr 2024 16:15:31 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Schwinger-Keldysh non-perturbative field theory of open quantum systems beyond the Markovian regime: Application to spin-boson and spin-chain-boson models</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00765</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Felipe Reyes-Osorio, Federico Garcia-Gaitan, David J. Strachan, Petr Plechac, Stephen R. Clark, Branislav K. Nikolic&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We develop a unified framework for open quantum systems composed of many mutually interacting quantum spins, or any isomorphic systems like qubits and qudits, surrounded by one or more independent bosonic baths. Our framework, based on Schwinger-Keldysh field theory (SKFT), can handle arbitrary spin value S, dimensionality of space, and geometry, while being applicable to a large parameter space for system and bath or their coupling. It can probe regimes in which non-Markovian dynamics and nonperturbative effects pose formidable challenges for other state-of-the-art theoretical methods. This is achieved by working with the two-particle irreducible (2PI) effective action, which resums classes of Feynman diagrams of SKFT to an infinite order. Furthermore, such diagrams are generated via an expansion in 1/N, where N is the number of Schwinger bosons we employ to map spin operators onto canonically commuting ones, rather than via conventional expansion in system-bath coupling constant. We carefully benchmark our SKFT+2PI-computed results vs. numerically (quasi)exact ones from tensor network calculations applied to the archetypical spin-boson model where both methodologies are applicable. Additionally, we demonstrate the capability of SKFT+2PI to handle a much more complex spin-chain-boson model with multiple baths interacting with each spin where no benchmark from other methods is available at present. The favorable numerical cost of solving integro-differential equations produced by the SKFT+2PI framework with an increasing number of spins and time steps makes it a promising route for simulating driven-dissipative systems in quantum computing, quantum magnonics, and quantum spintronics.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00765'&gt;arXiv:2405.00765&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 01 May 2024 17:57:08 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Barren Plateaus in Variational Quantum Computing</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00781</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Martin Larocca, Supanut Thanasilp, Samson Wang, Kunal Sharma, Jacob Biamonte, Patrick J. Coles, Lukasz Cincio, Jarrod R. McClean, Zoë Holmes, M. Cerezo&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Variational quantum computing offers a flexible computational paradigm with applications in diverse areas. However, a key obstacle to realizing their potential is the Barren Plateau (BP) phenomenon. When a model exhibits a BP, its parameter optimization landscape becomes exponentially flat and featureless as the problem size increases. Importantly, all the moving pieces of an algorithm -- choices of ansatz, initial state, observable, loss function and hardware noise -- can lead to BPs when ill-suited. Due to the significant impact of BPs on trainability, researchers have dedicated considerable effort to develop theoretical and heuristic methods to understand and mitigate their effects. As a result, the study of BPs has become a thriving area of research, influencing and cross-fertilizing other fields such as quantum optimal control, tensor networks, and learning theory. This article provides a comprehensive review of the current understanding of the BP phenomenon.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00781'&gt;arXiv:2405.00781&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 01 May 2024 18:00:10 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Single-layer tensor network approach for three-dimensional quantum systems</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Illia Lukin, Andrii Sotnikov&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Calculation of observables with three-dimensional projected entangled pair states is generally hard, as it requires a contraction of complex multi-layer tensor networks. We utilize the multi-layer structure of these tensor networks to largely simplify the contraction. The proposed approach involves the usage of the layer structure both to simplify the search for the boundary projected entangled pair states and the single-layer mapping of the final corner transfer matrix renormalization group contraction. We benchmark our results on the cubic lattice Heisenberg model, reaching the bond dimension D = 7, and find a good agreement with the previous results.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01489'&gt;arXiv:2405.01489&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 02 May 2024 17:23:58 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Fractional quantum anomalous Hall effect in a singular flat band</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01829</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Wenqi Yang, Dawei Zhai, Tixuan Tan, Feng-Ren Fan, Zuzhang Lin, Wang Yao&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; In the search of fractional quantum anomalous Hall (FQAH) effect, the conventional wisdom is to start from a flat Chern band isolated from the rest of the Hilbert space by band gaps, so that many-body interaction can be projected to a landscape that mimics a Landau level. Singular flat bands (SFB), which share protected touching points with other dispersive bands, represent another type of flat landscapes differing from Landau levels and Chern bands in topological and geometric properties. Here we report the finding of FQAH phases in a SFB, which emerges in the bipartite limit of the nearest-neighbor tight-binding model of twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$. At 1/3 and 2/3 filling of the SFB, FQAH effects are demonstrated using density matrix renormalisation group calculations with all bands, as well as exact diagonalization calculations with the two touching bands. Gapping the band touching can turn the SFB into a nearly flat Chern band, but counter-intuitively this suppresses the FQAH effect, as the gap opening introduces strong inhomogeneity to the quantum geometry. An optical scheme to realize such SFB for cold atoms is provided. Our findings uncover a new arena for the exploration of fractional quantum Hall physics beyond the Landau level and Chern insulator paradigms.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01829'&gt;arXiv:2405.01829&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 03 May 2024 03:25:25 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Smoothly vanishing density in the contact process by an interplay of disorder and long-distance dispersal</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; R. Juhász, I. A. Kovács&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Realistic modeling of ecological population dynamics requires spatially explicit descriptions that can take into account spatial heterogeneity as well as long-distance dispersal. Here, we present Monte Carlo simulations and numerical renormalization group results for the paradigmatic model, the contact process, in the combined presence of these factors in both one and two-dimensional systems. Our results confirm our analytic arguments stating that the density vanishes smoothly at the extinction threshold, in a way characteristic of infinite-order transitions. This extremely smooth vanishing of the global density entails an enhanced exposure of the population to extinction events. At the same time, a reverse order parameter, the local persistence displays a discontinuity characteristic of mixed-order transitions, as it approaches a non-universal critical value algebraically with an exponent $\beta_p'&lt;1$.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02003'&gt;arXiv:2405.02003&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 03 May 2024 11:03:09 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Vibrational Entanglement through the Lens of Quantum Information Measures</title>

Lieberherr, Markus Reiher&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We introduce a quantum information analysis of vibrational wave functions to understand complex vibrational spectra of molecules with strong anharmonic couplings and vibrational resonances. For this purpose, we define one- and two-modal entropies to guide the identification of strongly coupled vibrational modes and to characterize correlations within modal basis sets. We evaluate these descriptors for multi-configurational vibrational wave functions which we calculate with the n-mode vibrational density matrix renormalization group algorithm. Based on the quantum information measures, we present a vibrational entanglement analysis of the vibrational ground and excited states of CO2, which display strong anharmonic effects due to the symmetry-induced and accidental (near-) degeneracies. We investigate the entanglement signature of the Fermi resonance and discuss the maximally entangled state arising from the two degenerate bending modes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02031'&gt;arXiv:2405.02031&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 03 May 2024 12:06:32 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Energy-filtered quantum states and the emergence of non-local correlations</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Gianluca Morettini, Luca Capizzi, Maurizio Fagotti, Leonardo Mazza&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Energy-filtered quantum states are promising candidates for efficiently simulating thermal states. We explore a protocol designed to transition a product state into an eigenstate located in the middle of the spectrum; this is achieved by gradually reducing its energy variance, which allows us to comprehensively understand the crossover phenomenon and the subsequent convergence towards thermal behavior. We introduce and discuss three energy-filtering regimes (short, medium and long), and we interpret them as stages of thermalization. We show that the properties of the filtered states are locally indistinguishable from those of time-averaged density matrices, routinely employed in the theory of thermalization. On the other hand, unexpected non-local quantum correlations are generated in the medium regimes and are witnessed by the Rényi entanglement entropies of subsystems, which we compute via replica methods. Specifically, two-point correlation functions break cluster decomposition and the entanglement entropy of large regions scales as the logarithm of the volume during the medium filter time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02158'&gt;arXiv:2405.02158&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 03 May 2024 15:06:20 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Fermionization and collective excitations of 1D polariton lattices</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Johannes Knörzer, Rafał Ołdziejewski, Puneet A. Murthy, Ivan Amelio&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We theoretically demonstrate that the hallmarks of correlation and fermionization in a one-dimensional exciton-polaritons gas can be observed with state-of-the-art technology. Our system consists of a chain of excitonic quantum dots coupled to a photonic waveguide, with a low filling of polaritons. We analytically identify the Tonks-Girardeau, Tavis-Cummings and mean-field limits and relate them to different regimes of the excitonic anharmonicity and photonic bandwidth. Using matrix-product states, we numerically calculate the ground-state energies, correlation functions and dynamic structure factor of the system. In particular, the latter has a finite weight in the Lieb-Liniger hole branch, and the density-density correlator displays Friedel-like oscillations for realistic parameters, which reveal the onset of fermionization close to the Tonks-Girardeau regime. Our work encourages future experiments aimed at observing, for the first time and in spite of the moderate excitonic anharmonicity, strongly correlated exciton-polariton physics.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02251'&gt;arXiv:2405.02251&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 03 May 2024 17:09:12 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Spontaneous Strong Symmetry Breaking in Open Systems: Purification Perspective</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02402</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Pablo Sala, Sarang Gopalakrishnan, Masaki Oshikawa, Yizhi You&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We explore the landscape of the decoherence effect in mixed-state ensembles from a purification perspective. We analyze the spontaneous strong-to-weak symmetry breaking (SSSB) in mixed states triggered by local quantum channels by mapping this decoherence process to unitary operations in the purified state within an extended Hilbert space. Our key finding is that mixed-state long-range order and SSSB can be mapped into symmetry-protected topological (SPT) order in the purified state. Notably, the measurement-induced long-range order in the purified SPT state mirrors the long-range order in the mixed state due to SSSB, characterized by the Renyi-2 correlator. We establish a correspondence between fidelity correlators in the mixed state, which serve as a measure of SSSB, and strange correlators in the purification, which signify the SPT order. This purification perspective is further extended to explore intrinsic mixed-state topological order and decoherent symmetry-protected topological phases.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02402'&gt;arXiv:2405.02402&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 03 May 2024 18:00:04 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Validating Large-Scale Quantum Machine Learning: Efficient Simulation of Quantum Support Vector Machines Using Tensor Networks</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02630</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Kuan-Cheng Chen, Tai-Yue Li, Yun-Yuan Wang, Simon See, Chun-Chieh Wang, Robert Wille, Nan-Yow Chen, An-Cheng Yang, Chun-Yu Lin&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We present an efficient tensor-network-based approach for simulating large-scale quantum circuits, demonstrated using Quantum Support Vector Machines (QSVMs). Our method effectively reduces exponential runtime growth to near-quadratic scaling with respect to the number of qubits in practical scenarios. Traditional state-vector simulations become computationally infeasible beyond approximately 50 qubits; in contrast, our simulator successfully handles QSVMs with up to 784 qubits, completing simulations within seconds on a single high-performance GPU. Furthermore, by employing the Message Passing Interface (MPI) in multi-GPU environments, the approach shows strong linear scalability, reducing computation time as dataset size increases. We validate the framework on the MNIST and Fashion MNIST datasets, achieving successful multiclass classification and emphasizing the potential of QSVMs for high-dimensional data analysis. By integrating tensor-network techniques with high-performance computing resources, this work demonstrates both the feasibility and scalability of large-qubit quantum machine learning models, providing a valuable validation tool in the emerging Quantum-HPC ecosystem.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02630'&gt;arXiv:2405.02630&lt;/a&gt;] Published Sat, 04 May 2024 10:37:01 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Using magnetic dynamics to measure the spin gap in a candidate Kitaev material</title>

Turner, Yuan Li, Yao Wang, Yingying Peng&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Materials potentially hosting Kitaev spin-liquid states are considered crucial for realizing topological quantum computing. However, the intricate nature of spin interactions within these materials complicates the precise measurement of low-energy spin excitations indicative of fractionalized excitations. Using Na$_{2}$Co$_2$TeO$_{6}$ as an example, we study these low-energy spin excitations using the time-resolved resonant elastic x-ray scattering (tr-REXS). Our observations unveil remarkably slow spin dynamics at the magnetic peak, whose recovery timescale is several nanoseconds. This timescale aligns with the extrapolated spin gap of $\sim$ 1 $\mu$eV, obtained by density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations in the thermodynamic limit. The consistency demonstrates the efficacy of tr-REXS in discerning low-energy spin gaps inaccessible to conventional spectroscopic techniques.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03212'&gt;arXiv:2405.03212&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 06 May 2024 07:18:26 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Fundamental role of nonlocal orders in 1D Extended Bose-Hubbard Model</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Nitya Cuzzuol, Arianna Montorsi&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Nonlocal order parameters capture the presence of correlated fluctuations between specific degrees of freedom, in otherwise disordered quantum matter. Here we provide a further example of their fundamental role, deriving the ground state phase diagram of the filling one extended Bose Hubbard model exclusively in terms of their ordering. By means of a density matrix renormalization group numerical analysis, we show that besides the (even) parity order characteristic of the Mott insulating phase, and the string order non vanishing in the Haldane insulator, the recently proposed odd parity order completes the picture, becoming nonvanishing at the transition from the normal superfluid to the paired superfluid phase. The above three nonlocal parameters capture all the distinct phases, including the density wave phase which local order is seen as the simultaneous presence of correlated fluctuations in different channels. They provide a unique tool for the experimental observation of the full phase diagram of strongly correlated quantum matter, by means of local density measurements.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03336'&gt;arXiv:2405.03336&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 06 May 2024 10:35:11 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Early Fault-Tolerant Quantum Algorithms in Practice: Application to Ground-State Energy Estimation</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03754</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Oriel Kiss, Utkarsh Azad, Borja Requena, Alessandro Roggero, David Wakeham, Juan Miguel Arrazola&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We investigate the feasibility of early fault-tolerant quantum algorithms focusing on ground-state energy estimation problems. In particular, we examine the computation of the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the spectral measure of a Hamiltonian and the identification of its discontinuities. Scaling these methods to larger system sizes reveals three key challenges: the smoothness of the CDF for large supports, the lack of tight lower bounds on the overlap with the true ground state, and the difficulty of preparing high-quality initial states. To address these challenges, we propose a signal processing approach to find these estimates automatically, in the regime where the quality of the initial state is unknown. Rather than aiming for exact ground-state energy, we advocate for improving classical estimates by targeting the low-energy support of the initial state. Additionally, we provide quantitative resource estimates, demonstrating a constant-factor improvement in the number of samples required to detect a specified change in CDF. Our numerical experiments, conducted on a 26-qubit fully connected Heisenberg model, leverage a truncated density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) initial state with a low bond dimension. The results show that the predictions from the quantum algorithm align closely with the DMRG-converged energies at larger bond dimensions while requiring several orders of magnitude fewer samples than theoretical estimates suggest. These findings underscore that CDF-based quantum algorithms are a practical and resource-efficient alternative to quantum phase estimation, particularly in resource-constrained scenarios.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03754'&gt;arXiv:2405.03754&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 06 May 2024 18:00:03 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

The resulting class of states, which we refer to as tensor network functions, inherit the conceptual advantages of tensor network states while removing computational restrictions arising from the need to converge approximate contractions. We use tensor network functions to compute strict variational estimates of the energy on loopy graphs, analyze their expressive power for ground-states, show that we can capture aspects of volume law time evolution, and provide a mapping of general feed-forward neural nets onto efficient tensor network functions. Our work expands the realm of computable tensor networks to ones where accurate contraction methods are not available, and opens up new avenues to use tensor networks.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03797'&gt;arXiv:2405.03797&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 06 May 2024 19:04:13 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Logic-Skill Programming: An Optimization-based Approach to Sequential Skill Planning</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04082</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Teng Xue, Amirreza Razmjoo, Suhan Shetty, Sylvain Calinon&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Recent advances in robot skill learning have unlocked the potential to construct task-agnostic skill libraries, facilitating the seamless sequencing of multiple simple manipulation primitives (aka. skills) to tackle significantly more complex tasks. Nevertheless, determining the optimal sequence for independently learned skills remains an open problem, particularly when the objective is given solely in terms of the final geometric configuration rather than a symbolic goal. To address this challenge, we propose Logic-Skill Programming (LSP), an optimization-based approach that sequences independently learned skills to solve long-horizon tasks. We formulate a first-order extension of a mathematical program to optimize the overall cumulative reward of all skills within a plan, abstracted by the sum of value functions. To solve such programs, we leverage the use of tensor train factorization to construct the value function space, and rely on alternations between symbolic search and skill value optimization to find the appropriate skill skeleton and optimal subgoal sequence. Experimental results indicate that the obtained value functions provide a superior approximation of cumulative rewards compared to state-of-the-art reinforcement learning methods. Furthermore, we validate LSP in three manipulation domains, encompassing both prehensile and non-prehensile primitives. The results demonstrate its capability to identify the optimal solution over the full logic and geometric path. The real-robot experiments showcase the effectiveness of our approach to cope with contact uncertainty and external disturbances in the real world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04082'&gt;arXiv:2405.04082&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 07 May 2024 07:27:28 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Multiple crossing during dynamical symmetry restoration and implications for the quantum Mpemba effect</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04436</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Konstantinos Chalas, Filiberto Ares, Colin Rylands, Pasquale Calabrese&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Local relaxation after a quench in 1-D quantum many-body systems is a well known and very active problem with rich phenomenology. Except for pathological cases, the local relaxation is accompanied by the local restoration of the symmetries broken by the initial state that are preserved by the unitary evolution. Recently, the entanglement asymmetry has been introduced as a probe to study the interplay between symmetry breaking and relaxation in an extended quantum system. In particular, using the asymmetry, it has been shown that the more a symmetry is initially broken, the faster it may be restored. This surprising effect, which has been also observed in trapped-ion experiments, can be seen as a quantum version of the Mpemba effect and is manifested by the crossing at a finite time of the entanglement asymmetry curves of two different initial symmetry breaking configurations. In this paper we show, how, by tuning the initial state, the symmetry dynamics in free fermionic systems can display much richer behaviour than seen previously. In particular, for certain classes of initial states, including ground states of free fermionic models with long-range couplings, the entanglement asymmetry can exhibit multiple crossings. This illustrates that the existence of the quantum Mpemba effect can only be inferred by examining the late time behaviour of the entanglement asymmetry.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04436'&gt;arXiv:2405.04436&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 07 May 2024 15:57:45 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Exact solution of long-range stabilizer Rényi entropy in the dual-unitary XXZ model</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04448</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Jordi Arnau Montañà López, Pavel Kos&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Quantum systems can not be efficiently simulated classically due to the presence of entanglement and nonstabilizerness, also known as quantum magic. Here we study the generation of magic under evolution by a quantum circuit. To be able to provide exact solutions, we focus on the dual-unitary XXZ model and a measure of magic called stabilizer Rényi entropy (SRE). Moreover, we focus also on long-range SRE, which cannot be removed by short-depth quantum circuits. To obtain exact solutions we use a ZX-calculus representation and graphical rules for the evaluation of the required expressions. We obtain exact results for SRE after short-time evolution in the thermodynamic limit and for long-range SRE for all times and all Rényi parameters for a particular partition of the state. Since the numerical evaluation of these quantities is exponentially costly in the Rényi parameter, we verify this numerically for low Rényi parameters and accessible system sizes and provide numerical results for the long-range SRE in other bipartitions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04448'&gt;arXiv:2405.04448&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 07 May 2024 16:13:45 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Emergent Conformal Symmetry at the Multicritical Point of (2+1)D SO(5) Model with Wess-Zumino-Witten Term on Sphere</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04470</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Bin-Bin Chen, Xu Zhang, Zi Yang Meng&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Novel critical phenomena beyond the Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson paradigm have been long sought after. Among many candidate scenarios, the deconfined quantum critical point (DQCP) constitutes the most fascinating one, and its lattice model realization has been debated over the past two decades. Following the pioneering works with the fuzzy sphere methods [W. Zhu, et al, Phys. Rev. X 13, 021009], we apply the spherical Landau level regularization to study the effective (2+1)D SO(5) non-linear sigma model with a topological term and the potential DQCP therein. Utilizing the state-of-the-art density matrix renormalization group method with explicit $\text{SU(2)}_\text{spin}\times\text{U(1)}_\text{charge}\times\text{U(1)}_\text{angular-momentum}$ symmetry as well as exact diagonalization simulations, we provide a comprehensive phase diagram for the model with a SO(5) continuous transition line -- extension of the previous identified SO(5) multicritical point [arXiv:2307.05307] -- while tuning interaction length. The state-operator correspondence with the conformal tower structure is used to identify the emergent conformal symmetry with the best scaling dimension of relevant primary fields and they match well with the critical exponents obtained from the crossing point analysis of the correlation ratio. Our results thus further support the rich structure of the phase diagram of the SO(5) model.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04470'&gt;arXiv:2405.04470&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 07 May 2024 16:31:37 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Neural Network Quantum States for the Interacting Hofstadter Model with Higher Local Occupations and Long-Range Interactions</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04472</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Fabian Döschl, Felix A. Palm, Hannah Lange, Fabian Grusdt, Annabelle Bohrdt&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Due to their immense representative power, neural network quantum states (NQS) have gained significant interest in current research. In recent advances in the field of NQS, it has been demonstrated that this approach can compete with state-of-the-art numerical techniques, making NQS a compelling alternative, in particular for the simulation of large, two-dimensional quantum systems. In this study, we show that recurrent neural network (RNN) wave functions can be employed to study systems relevant to current research in quantum many-body physics. Specifically, we employ a 2D tensorized gated RNN to explore the bosonic Hofstadter model with a variable local Hilbert space cut-off and long-range interactions. At first, we benchmark the RNN-NQS for the Hofstadter-Bose-Hubbard (HBH) Hamiltonian on a square lattice. We find that this method is, despite the complexity of the wave function, capable of efficiently identifying and representing most ground state properties. Afterwards, we apply the method to an even more challenging model for current methods, namely the Hofstadter model with long-range interactions. This model describes Rydberg-dressed atoms on a lattice subject to a synthetic magnetic field. We study systems of size up to $12 \times 12$ sites and identify three different regimes by tuning the interaction range and the filling fraction $\nu$. In addition to phases known from the HBH model at short-ranged interaction, we observe bubble crystals and Wigner crystals for long-ranged interactions. Especially interesting is the evidence of a bubble crystal phase on a lattice, as this gives experiments a starting point for the search of clustered liquid phases, possibly hosting non-Abelian anyon excitations. In our work we show that NQS are an efficient and reliable simulation method for quantum systems, which are the subject of current research.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04472'&gt;arXiv:2405.04472&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 07 May 2024 16:36:28 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Disorder free many-body localization transition in two quasiperiodically coupled Heisenberg spin chains</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04516</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; K. G. S. H. Gunawardana, Bruno Uchoa&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Disorder free many-body localization (MBL) can occur in interacting systems that can dynamically generate their own disorder. We address the thermal-MBL phase transition of two isotropic Heisenberg spin chains that are quasi-periodically coupled to each other. The spin chains are incommensurate and are coupled through a short range exchange interaction of the $XXZ$ type that decays exponentially with the distance. Using exact diagonalization, matrix product states and density matrix renormalization group, we calculate the time evolution of the entanglement entropy at long times and extract the inverse participation ratio in the thermodynamic limit. We show that this system has a robust MBL phase. We establish the phase diagram with the onset of MBL as a function of the interchain exchange coupling and of the incommensuration between the spin chains. The Ising limit of the interchain interaction optimizes the stability of the MBL phase over a broad range of incommensurations above a given critical exchange coupling. Incorporation of interchain spin flips significantly enhances entanglement between the spin chains and produces delocalization, favoring a pre-thermal phase whose entanglement entropy grows logarithmically with time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04516'&gt;arXiv:2405.04516&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 07 May 2024 17:49:12 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Language Modeling Using Tensor Trains</title>

TTLM represents sentences in an exponential space constructed by the tensor product of words, but computing the probabilities of sentences in a low-dimensional fashion. We demonstrate that the architectures of Second-order RNNs, Recurrent Arithmetic Circuits (RACs), and Multiplicative Integration RNNs are, essentially, special cases of TTLM. Experimental evaluations on real language modeling tasks show that the proposed variants of TTLM (i.e., TTLM-Large and TTLM-Tiny) outperform the vanilla Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) with low-scale of hidden units.

      <title>Cost of Locally Approximating High-Dimensional Ground States of Contextual Quantum Models</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04884</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Kaiyan Yang, Yanzheng Zhu, Xiao Zeng, Zuoheng Zou, Man-Hong Yung, Zizhu Wang&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Contextuality, one of the strongest forms of quantum correlations, delineates the quantum world and the classical one. It has been shown recently that some quantum models, in the form of infinite one-dimensional translation-invariant Hamiltonians with nearest- and next-to-nearest-neighbor interactions, have the lowest ground state energy density allowed in quantum physics. However, these models all have local Hilbert space dimension larger than two, making the study of their ground state behavior difficult on current qubit-based variational quantum simulation platforms. In this work, we focus on the cost of simulating the local approximations of ground states of these models using qubit-based parameterized quantum circuits. The local approximations, which are 3-site reduced density matrices with local Hilbert space dimension three, are purified then encoded into permutation-symmetric qubits. We develop a universal set of permutation-symmetry preserving qubit-based gates, using them as an ansatz to simulate parameterized quantum circuits designed for qutrits. These techniques allow us to assess the accuracy of simulating the purified local ground states with respect to a fixed amount of classical and quantum resources. We found that given the same quantum circuit and the number of iterations, more contextual ground states with lower energy density are easier to simulate.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04884'&gt;arXiv:2405.04884&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 08 May 2024 08:35:31 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Boosted Imaginary Time Evolution of Matrix Product States</title>

Symons, Dilhan Manawadu, David Galvin, Stefano Mensa&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; In this work, we consider the imaginary time evolution of matrix product states. We present a novel quantum-inspired classical method that, when combined with time evolving block decimation (TEBD), is able to potentially speed-up the convergence to a ground state compared to TEBD alone. Our method, referred to as boosted imaginary time evolution, relies on the use of reflections to boost to lower energy states. Interleaving TEBD steps with boosts reduces the total number of TEBD steps and potentially the computational cost required to imaginary time evolve a matrix product state to a ground state. We give the mathematical details of the method followed by an algorithmic implementation and finally some results for a simple test case.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04959'&gt;arXiv:2405.04959&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 08 May 2024 10:57:39 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Simulating Spin Dynamics of Supersolid States in a Quantum Ising Magnet</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05151</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Yi Xu, Juraj Hasik, Boris Ponsioen, Andriy H. Nevidomskyy&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Motivated by a recent experimental study on the quantum Ising magnet $\text{K}_2\text{Co}(\text{SeO}_3)_2$ that presented spectroscopic evidence of zero-field supersolidity (Chen et al., arXiv:2402.15869), we simulate the excitation spectrum of the corresponding microscopic $XXZ$ model for the compound, using the recently developed excitation ansatz for infinite projected entangled-pair states. We map out the ground state phase diagram and compute the dynamical spin structure factors across a range of magnetic field strengths, focusing especially on the two supersolid phases found near zero and saturation fields. Our simulated excitation spectra for the zero-field supersolid "Y" phase are in excellent agreement with the experimental data - recovering the low-energy branches and integer quantized excited energy levels $\omega_n=nJ_{zz}$. Furthermore, we demonstrate the nonlocal multi-spin-flip features for modes at $\omega_2$, indicative of their multi-magnon nature. Additionally, we identify characteristics of the high-field supersolid "$\Psi$" phase in the simulated spectra, which should be compared with future experimental results.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05151'&gt;arXiv:2405.05151&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 08 May 2024 15:43:22 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Higher Berry Curvature from the Wave function II: Locally Parameterized States Beyond One Dimension</title>

This construction is particularly suitable when given a family of tensor networks that can be viewed as the ground states of $d$ dimensional lattice systems, for which we construct the closed $(d+2)$-form higher Berry curvature, which is a generalization of the well known 2-form Berry curvature. Such $(d+2)$-form higher Berry curvature characterizes a flow of $(d+1)$-form higher Berry curvature in the system. Our construction is equally suitable for constructing other higher pumps, such as the (higher) Thouless pump in the presence of a global on-site $U(1)$ symmetry, which corresponds to a closed $d$-form. The cohomology classes of such higher differential forms are topological invariants and are expected to be quantized for short-range entangled states. We illustrate our construction with exactly solvable lattice models that are in nontrivial higher Berry classes in $d=2$.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05323'&gt;arXiv:2405.05323&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 08 May 2024 18:00:08 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Higher Berry Phase from Projected Entangled Pair States in (2+1) dimensions</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Shuhei Ohyama, Shinsei Ryu&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We consider families of invertible many-body quantum states in $d$ spatial dimensions that are parameterized over some parameter space $X$. The space of such families is expected to have topologically distinct sectors classified by the cohomology group $\mathrm{H}^{d+2}(X;\mathbb{Z})$. These topological sectors are distinguished by a topological invariant built from a generalization of the Berry phase, called the higher Berry phase. In the previous work, we introduced a generalized inner product for three one-dimensional many-body quantum states, (``triple inner product''). The higher Berry phase for one-dimensional invertible states can be introduced through the triple inner product and furthermore the topological invariant, which takes its value in $\mathrm{H}^{3}(X;\mathbb{Z})$, can be extracted. In this paper, we introduce an inner product of four two-dimensional invertible quantum many-body states. We use it to measure the topological nontriviality of parameterized families of 2d invertible states. In particular, we define a topological invariant of such families that takes values in $\mathrm{H}^{4}(X;\mathbb{Z})$. Our formalism uses projected entangled pair states (PEPS). We also construct a specific example of non-trivial parameterized families of 2d invertible states parameterized over $\mathbb{R}P^4$ and demonstrate the use of our formula. Applications for symmetry-protected topological phases are also discussed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05325'&gt;arXiv:2405.05325&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 08 May 2024 18:00:20 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

Previous works identified the underlying mathematical structure (the gerbe structure) and introduced a multi-wavefunction overlap, a generalization of the inner product in quantum mechanics, which allows for the extraction of the higher Berry phase and topological invariants. In this paper, building on these works, we introduce a connection, the higher Berry connection, for a family of parameterized Matrix Product States (MPS) over a parameter space.

      <title>Quantum Phases and Transitions in Spin Chains with Non-Invertible Symmetries</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05331</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Arkya Chatterjee, Ömer M. Aksoy, Xiao-Gang Wen&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Generalized symmetries often appear in the form of emergent symmetries in low energy effective descriptions of quantum many-body systems. Non-invertible symmetries are a particularly exotic class of generalized symmetries, in that they are implemented by transformations that do not form a group. Such symmetries appear in large families of gapless states of quantum matter and constrain their low-energy dynamics. To provide a UV-complete description of such symmetries, it is useful to construct lattice models that respect these symmetries exactly. In this paper, we discuss two families of one-dimensional lattice Hamiltonians with finite on-site Hilbert spaces: one with (invertible) $S^{\,}_3$ symmetry and the other with non-invertible $\mathsf{Rep}(S^{\,}_3)$ symmetry. Our models are largely analytically tractable and demonstrate all possible spontaneous symmetry breaking patterns of these symmetries. Moreover, we use numerical techniques to study the nature of continuous phase transitions between the different symmetry-breaking gapped phases associated with both symmetries. Both models have self-dual lines, where the models are enriched by so-called intrinsically non-invertible symmetries generated by Kramers-Wannier-like duality transformations. We provide explicit lattice operators that generate these non-invertible self-duality symmetries. We show that the enhanced symmetry at the self-dual lines is described by a 2+1D symmetry-topological-order (SymTO) of type $\mathrm{JK}^{\,}_4\boxtimes \overline{\mathrm{JK}}^{\,}_4$. The condensable algebras of the SymTO determine the allowed gapped and gapless states of the self-dual $S^{\,}_3$-symmetric and $\mathsf{Rep}(S^{\,}_3)$-symmetric models.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05331'&gt;arXiv:2405.05331&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 08 May 2024 18:04:10 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Unbiasing Fermionic Auxiliary-Field Quantum Monte Carlo with Matrix Product State Trial Wavefunctions</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Tong Jiang, Bryan O'Gorman, Ankit Mahajan, Joonho Lee&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; In this work, we report, for the first time, an implementation of fermionic auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (AFQMC) using matrix product state (MPS) trial wavefunctions, dubbed MPS-AFQMC. Calculating overlaps between an MPS trial and arbitrary Slater determinants up to a multiplicative error, a crucial subroutine in MPS-AFQMC, is proven to be #P-hard. Nonetheless, we tested several promising heuristics in successfully improving fermionic phaseless AFQMC energies. We also proposed a way to evaluate local energy and force bias evaluations free of matrix product operators. This allows for larger basis set calculations without significant overhead. We showcase the utility of our approach on one- and two-dimensional hydrogen lattices, even when the MPS trial itself struggles to obtain high accuracy. Our work offers a new set of tools that can solve currently challenging electronic structure problems with future improvements.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05440'&gt;arXiv:2405.05440&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 08 May 2024 22:06:57 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Lattice Models for Phases and Transitions with Non-Invertible Symmetries</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05964</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Lakshya Bhardwaj, Lea E. Bottini, Sakura Schafer-Nameki, Apoorv Tiwari&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Non-invertible categorical symmetries have emerged as a powerful tool to uncover new beyond-Landau phases of matter, both gapped and gapless, along with second order phase transitions between them. The general theory of such phases in (1+1)d has been studied using the Symmetry Topological Field Theory (SymTFT), also known as topological holography. This has unearthed the infrared (IR) structure of these phases and transitions. In this paper, we describe how the SymTFT information can be converted into an ultraviolet (UV) anyonic chain lattice model realizing, in the IR limit, these phases and transitions. In many cases, the Hilbert space of the anyonic chain is tensor product decomposable and the model can be realized as a quantum spin-chain Hamiltonian. We also describe operators acting on the lattice models that are charged under non-invertible symmetries and act as order parameters for the phases and transitions. In order to fully describe the action of non-invertible symmetries, it is crucial to understand the symmetry twisted sectors of the lattice models, which we describe in detail. Throughout the paper, we illustrate the general concepts using the symmetry category $\mathsf{Rep}(S_3)$ formed by representations of the permutation group $S_3$, but our procedure can be applied to any fusion category symmetry.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05964'&gt;arXiv:2405.05964&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 09 May 2024 17:59:00 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Robust ultra-shallow shadows</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06022</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Renato M. S. Farias, Raghavendra D. Peddinti, Ingo Roth, Leandro Aolita&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We present a robust shadow estimation protocol for wide classes of low-depth measurement circuits that mitigates noise as long as the effective measurement map including noise is locally unitarily invariant. This is in practice an excellent approximation, encompassing for instance the case of ideal single-qubit Clifford gates composing the first circuit layer of an otherwise arbitrary circuit architecture and even non-Markovian, gate-dependent noise in the rest of the circuit. We argue that for weakly-correlated local noise, the measurement channel has an efficient matrix-product representation, and show how to estimate this directly from experimental data using tensor-network tools, eliminating the need for analytical or numeric calculations. We illustrate the relevance of our method with both numerics and proof-of-principle experiments on an IBM Quantum device. Numerically, we show that unmitigated shallow shadows with noisy circuits become more biased as the depth increases. In contrast, using the same number of samples, robust ultra-shallow shadows become more precise with increasing depth for relevant parameter regimes. The gain in sample efficiency is still limited by the noise per gate, resulting in an optimal circuit depth per noise level. Experimentally, we observe improved precision in two simple fidelity estimation tasks using five-qubit circuits with up to two layers of entangling gates, by about an order of magnitude. Under the practical constraints of current and near-term noisy quantum devices, our method maximally realizes the potential of shadow estimation with global rotations and identifies its fundamental limitations in the presence of noise.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06022'&gt;arXiv:2405.06022&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 09 May 2024 18:00:09 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Antonio Francesco Mello, Alessandro Santini, Mario Collura&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We introduce a novel hybrid approach combining tensor network methods with the stabilizer formalism to address the challenges of simulating many-body quantum systems. By integrating these techniques, we enhance our ability to accurately model unitary dynamics while mitigating the exponential growth of entanglement encountered in classical simulations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through applications to random Clifford T-doped circuits and Random Clifford Floquet Dynamics. This approach offers promising prospects for advancing our understanding of complex quantum phenomena and accelerating progress in quantum simulation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06045'&gt;arXiv:2405.06045&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 09 May 2024 18:32:10 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Estimating Non-Stabilizerness Dynamics Without Simulating It</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06054</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Alessio Paviglianiti, Guglielmo Lami, Mario Collura, Alessandro Silva&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We introduce the Iterative Clifford Circuit Renormalization (ICCR), a novel technique designed to efficiently handle the dynamics of non-stabilizerness (a.k.a. quantum magic) in generic quantum circuits. ICCR iteratively adjusts the starting circuit, transforming it into a Clifford circuit where all elements that can alter the non-stabilizerness, such as measurements or T gates, have been removed. In the process the initial state is renormalized in such a way that the new circuit outputs the same final state as the original one. This approach embeds the complex dynamics of non-stabilizerness in the flow of an effective initial state, enabling its efficient evaluation while avoiding the need for direct and computationally expensive simulation of the original circuit. The initial state renormalization can be computed explicitly using a matrix-product state approximation that can be systematically improved. We implement the ICCR algorithm to evaluate the non-stabilizerness dynamics for systems of size up to N = 1000. We validate our method by comparing it to tensor networks simulations. Finally, we employ the ICCR technique to study a magic purification circuit, where a measurement-induced transition is observed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06054'&gt;arXiv:2405.06054&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 09 May 2024 18:57:55 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Towards accurate spin-orbit splittings from relativistic multireference electronic structure theory</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06077</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Zijun Zhao, Francesco A. Evangelista&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Most nonrelativistic electron correlation methods can be adapted to account for relativistic effects, as long as the relativistic molecular spinor integrals are available, from either a four-, two-, or one-component mean-field calculation. However, relativistic multireference correlation methods remain a relatively unexplored area, with mixed evidence regarding the improvements brought by perturbative treatments. We report, for the first time, the implementation of state-averaged four-component multireference perturbation theories to second and third order based on the driven similarity renormalization group (DSRG). With our methods, named 4c-SA-DSRG-MRPT2 and 3, we find that the dynamical correlation included on top of 4c-CASSCF references can significantly improve the spin-orbit splittings in p-block elements and potential energy surfaces when compared to 4c-CASSCF and 4c-CASPT2 results. We further show that 4c-DSRG-MRPT2 and 3 are applicable to these systems over a wide range of the flow parameter, with systematic improvement from second to third order in terms of both improved error statistics and reduced sensitivity with respect to the flow parameter.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06077'&gt;arXiv:2405.06077&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 09 May 2024 20:01:01 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Low-rank quantics tensor train representations of Feynman diagrams for multiorbital electron-phonon models</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06440</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Hirone Ishida, Natsuki Okada, Shintaro Hoshino, Hiroshi Shinaoka&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Feynman diagrams are an essential tool for simulating strongly correlated electron systems. However, stochastic quantum Monte Carlo sampling suffers from the sign problem, particularly when solving a multiorbital quantum impurity model. Recently, two approaches have been proposed for efficient numerical treatment of Feynman diagrams: Tensor Cross Interpolation (TCI) to replace stochastic sampling and the Quantics Tensor Train (QTT) representation for compressing space-time dependence. One of the remaining challenges is the nontrivial task of identifying low-rank structures in weak-coupling Feynman diagrams for multiorbital electron-phonon systems. In particular, the traditional TCI algorithm faces an ergodicity problem, which prevents it from fully exploring the multiorbital space. To address this, we incorporate a new algorithm called global search, which resolves this issue. By combining this approach with QTT, we uncover low-rank structures and achieve efficient numerical integration with exponential resolution in time and faster-than-power-law convergence of error relative to computational cost. Additionally, our approach does not require the division of discontinuous regions necessary in non-quantics TCI.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06440'&gt;arXiv:2405.06440&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 10 May 2024 12:42:57 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Automatic Structural Search of Tensor Network States including Entanglement Renormalization</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06534</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Ryo Watanabe, Hiroshi Ueda&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Tensor network (TN) states, including entanglement renormalization (ER), can encompass a wider variety of entangled states. When the entanglement structure of the quantum state of interest is non-uniform in real space, accurately representing the state with a limited number of degrees of freedom hinges on appropriately configuring the TN to align with the entanglement pattern. However, a proposal has yet to show a structural search of ER due to its high computational cost and the lack of flexibility in its algorithm. In this study, we conducted an optimal structural search of TN, including ER, based on the reconstruction of their local structures with respect to variational energy. Firstly, we demonstrated that our algorithm for the spin-$1/2$ tetramer singlets model could calculate exact ground energy using the multi-scale entanglement renormalization ansatz (MERA) structure as an initial TN structure. Subsequently, we applied our algorithm to the random XY models with the two initial structures: MERA and the suitable structure underlying the strong disordered renormalization group. We found that, in both cases, our algorithm achieves improvements in variational energy, fidelity, and entanglement entropy. The degree of improvement in these quantities is superior in the latter case compared to the former, suggesting that utilizing an existing TN design method as a preprocessing step is important for maximizing our algorithm's performance.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06534'&gt;arXiv:2405.06534&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 10 May 2024 15:24:10 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>QSpace - An open-source tensor library for Abelian and non-Abelian symmetries</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06632</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Andreas Weichselbaum&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; This is the documentation for the tensor library QSpace (v4.0), a toolbox to exploit `quantum symmetry spaces' in tensor network states in the quantum many-body context. QSpace permits arbitrary combinations of symmetries including the abelian symmetries $\mathbb{Z}_n$ and $U(1)$, as well as all non-abelian symmetries based on the semisimple classical Lie algebras: $A_n$, $B_n$, $C_n$, and $D_n$, or respectively, the special unitary group SU($n$), the odd orthogonal group SO($2n+1$), the symplectic group Sp($2n$), and the even orthogonal group SO($2n$). The code (C++ embedded via the MEX interface into Matlab) is available open source as of QSpace v4.0 at https://bitbucket.org/qspace4u/ under the Apache 2.0 license. QSpace is designed as a bottom-up approach for non-abelian symmetries. It starts from the defining representation and the respective Lie algebra. By explicitly computing and tabulating generalized Clebsch-Gordan coefficient tensors, QSpace is versatile in the type of operations that it can perform across all symmetries. At the level of an application, much of the symmetry-related details are hidden within the QSpace C++ core libraries. Hence when developing tensor network algorithms with QSpace, these can be coded (nearly) as if there are no symmetries at all, despite being able to fully exploit general non-abelian symmetries.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06632'&gt;arXiv:2405.06632&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 10 May 2024 17:50:35 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>IETI-based Low-Rank method for PDE-constrained optimization</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06458</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Alexandra Bünger, Tom-Christian Riemer, Martin Stoll&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Isogeometric Analysis (IgA) is a versatile method for the discretization of partial differential equations on complex domains, which arise in various applications of science and engineering. Some complex geometries can be better described as a computational domain by a multi-patch approach, where each patch is determined by a tensor product Non-Uniform Rational Basis Splines (NURBS) parameterization. This allows on the one hand to consider the problem of the complex assembly of mass or stiffness matrices (or tensors) over the whole geometry locally on the individual smaller patches, and on the other hand it is possible to perform local mesh refinements independently on each patch, allowing efficient local refinement in regions of high activity where higher accuracy is required, while coarser meshes can be used elsewhere. Furthermore, the information about differing material models or properties that are to apply in a subdomain of the geometry can be included in the patch in which this subdomain is located. For this it must be ensured that the approximate solution is continuous over the entire computational domain and therefore at the interfaces of two (or more) patches. The most promising approach for this problem, which transfers the idea of Finite Element Tearing and Interconnecting (FETI) methods into the isogeometric setup, was the IsogEometric Tearing and Interconnecting (IETI) method, where by introducing a constraints matrix and associated Lagrange multipliers and formulating it into a dual problem, depending only on the Lagrange multipliers, continuity at the interfaces was ensured in solving the resulting system. In this paper we illustrate that low-rank methods based on the tensor-train format can be generalised for a multi-patch IgA setup, which follows the IETI idea.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06458'&gt;arXiv:2405.06458&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 10 May 2024 13:08:05 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Finite-size corrections to the energy spectra of gapless one-dimensional systems in the presence of boundaries</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Yifan Liu, Haruki Shimizu, Atsushi Ueda, Masaki Oshikawa&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We present the finite-size scaling theory of one-dimensional quantum critical systems in the presence of boundaries. While the finite-size spectrum in the conformal limit, namely of a conformal field theory with conformally invariant boundary conditions, is related to the dimensions of boundary operators by Cardy, the actual spectra of lattice models are affected by both bulk and boundary perturbations and contain non-universal boundary energies. We obtain a general expression of the finite-size energy levels in the presence of bulk and boundary perturbations. In particular, a generic boundary perturbation related to the energy-momentum tensor gives rise to a renormalization of the effective system size. We verify our field-theory formulation by comparing the results with the exact solution of the critical transverse-field Ising chain and with accurate numerical results on the critical three-state Potts chain obtained by Density-Matrix Renormalization Group.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06891'&gt;arXiv:2405.06891&lt;/a&gt;] Published Sat, 11 May 2024 03:17:48 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Randomized algorithms for computing the tensor train approximation and their applications</title>

Note that the TT-SVD and TT-cross are two well-known algorithms for these two problems. Firstly, by combining the random projection technique with the power scheme, we obtain two types of randomized algorithms for the fixed TT-rank problem. Secondly, by using the non-asymptotic theory of sub-random Gaussian matrices, we derive the upper bounds of the proposed randomized algorithms. Thirdly, we deduce a new deterministic strategy to estimate the desired TT-rank with a given tolerance and another adaptive randomized algorithm that finds a low TT-rank representation satisfying a given tolerance, and is beneficial when the target TT-rank is not known in advance. We finally illustrate the accuracy of the proposed algorithms via some test tensors from synthetic and real databases. In particular, for the fixed TT-rank problem, the proposed algorithms can be several times faster than the TT-SVD, and the accuracy of the proposed algorithms and the TT-SVD are comparable for several test tensors.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07147'&gt;arXiv:2405.07147&lt;/a&gt;] Published Sun, 12 May 2024 03:31:27 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Federated Hierarchical Tensor Networks: a Collaborative Learning Quantum AI-Driven Framework for Healthcare</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07735</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Amandeep Singh Bhatia, David E. Bernal Neira&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Healthcare industries frequently handle sensitive and proprietary data, and due to strict privacy regulations, they are often reluctant to share data directly. In today's context, Federated Learning (FL) stands out as a crucial remedy, facilitating the rapid advancement of distributed machine learning while effectively managing critical concerns regarding data privacy and governance. The fusion of federated learning and quantum computing represents a groundbreaking interdisciplinary approach with immense potential to revolutionize various industries, from healthcare to finance. In this work, we proposed a federated learning framework based on quantum tensor networks, which leverages the principles of many-body quantum physics. Currently, there are no known classical tensor networks implemented in federated settings. Furthermore, we investigated the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed framework by conducting a differential privacy analysis to ensure the security of sensitive data across healthcare institutions. Experiments on popular medical image datasets show that the federated quantum tensor network model achieved a mean receiver-operator characteristic area under the curve (ROC-AUC) between 0.91-0.98. Experimental results demonstrate that the quantum federated global model, consisting of highly entangled tensor network structures, showed better generalization and robustness and achieved higher testing accuracy, surpassing the performance of locally trained clients under unbalanced data distributions among healthcare institutions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07735'&gt;arXiv:2405.07735&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 13 May 2024 13:32:02 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

Mark, Jakub Zakrzewski&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; In recent years, the systems comprising of bosonic atoms confined to optical lattices at ultra-cold temperatures have demonstrated tremendous potential to unveil novel quantum mechanical effects appearing in lattice boson models with various kinds of interactions. In this progress report, we aim to provide an exposition to recent advancements in quantum simulations of such systems, modeled by different "non-standard" Bose-Hubbard models, focusing primarily on long-range systems with dipole-dipole or cavity-mediated interactions. Through a carefully curated selection of topics, which includes the emergence of quantum criticality beyond Landau paradigm, bond-order wave insulators, the role of interaction-induced tunneling, the influence of transverse confinement on observed phases, or the effect of cavity-mediated all-to-all interactions, we report both theoretical and experimental developments from the last few years. Additionally, we discuss the real-time evolution of systems with long-range interactions, where sufficiently strong interactions render the dynamics non-ergodic. And finally to cap our discussions off, we survey recent experimental achievements in this rapidly evolving field, underscoring its interdisciplinary significance and potential for groundbreaking discoveries.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07775'&gt;arXiv:2405.07775&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 13 May 2024 14:20:58 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Tensor networks for $p$-spin models</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08106</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Benjamin Lanthier, Jeremy Côté, Stefanos Kourtis&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We introduce a tensor network algorithm for the solution of $p$-spin models. We show that bond compression through rank-revealing decompositions performed during the tensor network contraction resolves logical redundancies in the system exactly and is thus lossless, yet leads to qualitative changes in runtime scaling in different regimes of the model. First, we find that bond compression emulates the so-called leaf-removal algorithm, solving the problem efficiently in the "easy" phase. Past a dynamical phase transition, we observe superpolynomial runtimes, reflecting the appearance of a core component. We then develop a graphical method to study the scaling of contraction for a minimal ensemble of core-only instances. We find subexponential scaling, improving on the exponential scaling that occurs without compression. Our results suggest that our tensor network algorithm subsumes the classical leaf removal algorithm and simplifies redundancies in the $p$-spin model through lossless compression, all without explicit knowledge of the problem's structure.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08106'&gt;arXiv:2405.08106&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 13 May 2024 18:33:14 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Cons-training Tensor Networks: Embedding and Optimization Over Discrete Linear Constraints</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09005</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Javier Lopez-Piqueres, Jing Chen&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; In this study, we introduce a novel family of tensor networks, termed constrained matrix product states (MPS), designed to incorporate exactly arbitrary discrete linear constraints, including inequalities, into sparse block structures. These tensor networks are particularly tailored for modeling distributions with support strictly over the feasible space, offering benefits such as reducing the search space in optimization problems, alleviating overfitting, improving training efficiency, and decreasing model size. Central to our approach is the concept of a quantum region, an extension of quantum numbers traditionally used in U(1) symmetric tensor networks, adapted to capture any linear constraint, including the unconstrained scenario. We further develop a novel canonical form for these new MPS, which allow for the merging and factorization of tensor blocks according to quantum region fusion rules and permit optimal truncation schemes. Utilizing this canonical form, we apply an unsupervised training strategy to optimize arbitrary objective functions subject to discrete linear constraints. Our method's efficacy is demonstrated by solving the quadratic knapsack problem, achieving superior performance compared to a leading nonlinear integer programming solver. Additionally, we analyze the complexity and scalability of our approach, demonstrating its potential in addressing complex constrained combinatorial optimization problems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09005'&gt;arXiv:2405.09005&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 15 May 2024 00:13:18 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Entanglement flow in the Kane-Fisher quantum impurity problem</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09046</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Chunyu Tan, Yuxiao Hang, Stephan Haas, Hubert Saleur&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The problem of a local impurity in a Luttinger liquid, just like the anisotropic Kondo problem (of which it is technically a cousin), describes many different physical systems. As shown by Kane and Fisher, the presence of interactions profoundly modifies the physics familiar from Fermi liquid theory, and leads to non-intuitive features, best described in the Renormalization Group language (RG), such as flows towards healed or split fixed points. While this problem has been studied for many years using more traditional condensed matter approaches, it remains somewhat mysterious from the point of view of entanglement, both for technical and conceptual reasons. We propose and explore in this paper a new way to think of this important aspect. We use the realization of the Kane Fisher universality class provided by an XXZ spin chain with a modified bond strength between two sites and explore the difference of (Von Neumann) entanglement entropies of a region of length $\ell$ with the rest of the system - to which it relates to a modified bond - in the cases when $\ell$ is even and odd. Surprisingly, we find out that this difference $\delta S\equiv Sê-Sô$ remains of $O(1)$ in the thermodynamic limit, and gives rise now, depending on the sign of the interactions, to "resonance" curves, interpolating between $-\ln 2$ and $0$, and depending on the product $\ell T_B$, where $1/T_B$ is a characteristic length scale akin to the Kondo length in Kondo problems. $\delta S$ can be interpreted as a measure of the hybridization of the left-over spin in odd length subsystems with the "bath" constituted by the rest of the chain. The problem is studied both numerically using DMRG and analytically near the healed and split fixed points. Interestingly - and in contrast with what happens in other impurity problems - $\delta S$ can, at least to lowest order, be tackled by conformal perturbation theory.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09046'&gt;arXiv:2405.09046&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 15 May 2024 02:50:26 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Augmenting Density Matrix Renormalization Group with Clifford Circuits</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Xiangjian Qian, Jiale Huang, Mingpu Qin&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) or Matrix Product States (MPS) are widely acknowledged as highly effective and accurate methods for solving one-dimensional quantum many-body systems. However, the direct application of DMRG to the study two-dimensional systems encounters challenges due to the limited entanglement encoded in the wave-function ansatz. Conversely, Clifford circuits offer a promising avenue for simulating states with substantial entanglement, albeit confined to stabilizer states. In this work, we present the seamless integration of Clifford circuits within the DMRG algorithm, leveraging the advantages of both Clifford circuits and DMRG. This integration leads to a significant enhancement in simulation accuracy with small additional computational cost. Moreover, this framework is useful not only for its current application but also for its potential to be easily adapted to various other numerical approaches&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09217'&gt;arXiv:2405.09217&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 15 May 2024 09:53:08 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Generalized cluster states from Hopf algebras: non-invertible symmetry and Hopf tensor network representation</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09277</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Zhian Jia&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Cluster states are crucial resources for measurement-based quantum computation (MBQC). It exhibits symmetry-protected topological (SPT) order, thus also playing a crucial role in studying topological phases. We present the construction of cluster states based on Hopf algebras. By generalizing the finite group valued qudit to a Hopf algebra valued qudit and introducing the generalized Pauli-X operator based on the regular action of the Hopf algebra, as well as the generalized Pauli-Z operator based on the irreducible representation action on the Hopf algebra, we develop a comprehensive theory of Hopf qudits. We demonstrate that non-invertible symmetry naturally emerges for Hopf qudits. Subsequently, for a bipartite graph termed the cluster graph, we assign the identity state and trivial representation state to even and odd vertices, respectively. Introducing the edge entangler as controlled regular action, we provide a general construction of Hopf cluster states. To ensure the commutativity of the edge entangler, we propose a method to construct a cluster lattice for any triangulable manifold. We use the 1d cluster state as an example to illustrate our construction. As this serves as a promising candidate for SPT phases, we construct the gapped Hamiltonian for this scenario and provide a detailed discussion of its non-invertible symmetries. We demonstrate that the 1d cluster state model is equivalent to the quasi-1d Hopf quantum double model with one rough boundary and one smooth boundary. We also discuss the generalization of the Hopf cluster state model to the Hopf ladder model through symmetry topological field theory. Furthermore, we introduce the Hopf tensor network representation of Hopf cluster states by integrating the tensor representation of structure constants with the string diagrams of the Hopf algebra, which can be used to solve the Hopf cluster state model.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09277'&gt;arXiv:2405.09277&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 15 May 2024 11:46:52 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Characterizing MPS and PEPS Preparable via Measurement and Feedback</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09615</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Yifan Zhang, Sarang Gopalakrishnan, Georgios Styliaris&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Preparing long-range entangled states poses significant challenges for near-term quantum devices. It is known that measurement and feedback (MF) can aid this task by allowing the preparation of certain paradigmatic long-range entangled states with only constant circuit depth. Here we systematically explore the structure of states that can be prepared using constant-depth local circuits and a single MF round. Using the framework of tensor networks, the preparability under MF translates to tensor symmetries. We detail the structure of matrix-product states (MPS) and projected entangled-pair states (PEPS) that can be prepared using MF, revealing the coexistence of Clifford-like properties and magic. In one dimension, we show that states with abelian symmetry protected topological order are a restricted class of MF-preparable states. In two dimensions, we parameterize a subset of states with abelian topological order that are MF-preparable. Finally, we discuss the analogous implementation of operators via MF, providing a structural theorem that connects to the well-known Clifford teleportation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09615'&gt;arXiv:2405.09615&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 15 May 2024 18:00:02 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Optimizing Tensor Contraction Paths: A Greedy Algorithm Approach With Improved Cost Functions</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Sheela Orgler, Mark Blacher&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Finding efficient tensor contraction paths is essential for a wide range of problems, including model counting, quantum circuits, graph problems, and language models. There exist several approaches to find efficient paths, such as the greedy and random greedy algorithm by Optimized Einsum (opt_einsum), and the greedy algorithm and hypergraph partitioning approach employed in cotengra. However, these algorithms require a lot of computational time and resources to find efficient contraction paths. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach based on the greedy algorithm by opt_einsum that computes efficient contraction paths in less time. Moreover, with our approach, we are even able to compute paths for large problems where modern algorithms fail.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09644'&gt;arXiv:2405.09644&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 08 May 2024 09:25:39 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Mean-field and cumulant approaches to modelling organic polariton physics</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09812</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Piper Fowler-Wright&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; In this thesis we develop methods for many-body open quantum systems and apply them to systems of organic polaritons. The methods employ a mean-field approach to reduce the dimensionality of large-scale problems. Initially assuming the absence of correlations in the many-body state, this approach is built upon in two ways. First, we show how the mean-field approximation can be combined with matrix product operator methods to efficiently simulate the non-Markovian dynamics of a many-body system with strong coupling to multiple environments. We apply this method to calculate the threshold and photoluminescence for a realistic model of an organic laser. Second, we extend the mean-field description by systematically including higher-order correlations via cumulant expansions of the Heisenberg equations of motion. We investigate the validity and convergence properties of these expansions, both with respect to expansion order and system size, for many-body systems with many-to-one network structures. We then show how the cumulant expansions may be used to calculate spatially resolved dynamics of organic polaritons. This enables a study of organic polariton transport in which we observe reversible conversion to dark exciton states and sub-group-velocity propagation. The methods established in this work offer versatile tools for analysing large, many-body open quantum systems and investigating finite-size effects. Their application reveals the intricate dynamics of organic polaritons resulting from the interplay of strong light-matter coupling and vibrational effects.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09812'&gt;arXiv:2405.09812&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 16 May 2024 04:54:41 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Low-rank Tree Tensor Network Operators for Long-Range Pairwise Interactions</title>

In this work, we study such representations for tree tensor networks, the so called tree tensor network operators (TTNOs), paying particular attention to Hamiltonian operators that involve long-range pairwise interactions between particles. Generalizing the work by Lin, Tong, and others on matrix product operators, we establish a direct connection between the hierarchical low-rank structure of the interaction matrix and the TTNO property. This connection allows us to arrive at very compact TTNO representations by compressing the interaction matrix into a hierarchically semi-separable matrix. Numerical experiments for different quantum spin systems validate our results and highlight the potential advantages of TTNOs over matrix product operators.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09952'&gt;arXiv:2405.09952&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 16 May 2024 09:55:25 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

We call such junctions open topological defects. One type of fusing matrices arises when two open defects fuse while another arises when an open defect passes through a boundary operator. We use the topological field theory approach to RCFTs based on Frobenius algebra objects in modular tensor categories to describe the general structure associated with such matrices and how to compute them from a given Frobenius algebra object and its representation theory. We illustrate the computational process on the rational free boson theories. Applications to boundary renormalisation group flows are briefly discussed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10189'&gt;arXiv:2405.10189&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 16 May 2024 15:33:13 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Universal entanglement correction induced by relevant deformations at the quantum critical point</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10230</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Rui-Zhen Huang, Chen Peng&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Local relevant deformations are important tool to study universal properties of quantum critical points. We investigate the effect of small relevant deformations on the bi-partite entanglement entropy at the quantum critical points. Within the quantum critical region, a universal power-law correction in the entanglement entropy induced by the relevant operator is found in both one- and two-dimensional critical lattice models. The exponent of the power-law correction term is determined by the scaling dimension of the relevant operator. Based on numerical simulations and scaling theory argument, it is conjectured that such a universal power-law correction in the entanglement entropy is universal for Lorentz invariant quantum critical points. Without Lorentz invariance, it is found the exponent in the power-law correction term does not fit in with the scaling argument in models with a dynamical exponent z=2 in two dimension. This may be because the relevant operator added in the lattice model corresponds to complicated operators in the corresponding conformal field theory. Our study provides a different perspective to extract universal information of quantum critical points. We expect it would be useful to detect unique properties of topological quantum phase transitions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10230'&gt;arXiv:2405.10230&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 16 May 2024 16:29:48 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Architectures and random properties of symplectic quantum circuits</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10264</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Diego García-Martín, Paolo Braccia, M. Cerezo&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Parametrized and random unitary (or orthogonal) $n$-qubit circuits play a central role in quantum information. As such, one could naturally assume that circuits implementing symplectic transformation would attract similar attention. However, this is not the case, as $\mathbb{SP}(d/2)$ -- the group of $d\times d$ unitary symplectic matrices -- has thus far been overlooked. In this work, we aim at starting to right this wrong. We begin by presenting a universal set of generators $\mathcal{G}$ for the symplectic algebra $i\mathfrak{sp}(d/2)$, consisting of one- and two-qubit Pauli operators acting on neighboring sites in a one-dimensional lattice. Here, we uncover two critical differences between such set, and equivalent ones for unitary and orthogonal circuits. Namely, we find that the operators in $\mathcal{G}$ cannot generate arbitrary local symplectic unitaries and that they are not translationally invariant. We then review the Schur-Weyl duality between the symplectic group and the Brauer algebra, and use tools from Weingarten calculus to prove that Pauli measurements at the output of Haar random symplectic circuits can converge to Gaussian processes. As a by-product, such analysis provides us with concentration bounds for Pauli measurements in circuits that form $t$-designs over $\mathbb{SP}(d/2)$. To finish, we present tensor-network tools to analyze shallow random symplectic circuits, and we use these to numerically show that computational-basis measurements anti-concentrate at logarithmic depth.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10264'&gt;arXiv:2405.10264&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 16 May 2024 17:15:39 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Interacting chiral fermions on the lattice with matrix product operator norms</title>

The fermion doubling problem is circumvented by constructing a Fock space endowed with a semi-definite norm. When projecting our theory on the the single-particle sector, we recover the framework of Stacey fermions, and we demonstrate that the scaling limit of the free model recovers the chiral fermion field. Technically, we make use of a matrix product operator norm to mimick the boundary of a higher dimensional topological theory. As a proof of principle, we consider a single Weyl fermion on a periodic ring with Hubbard-type nearest-neighbor interactions and construct a variational generalized DMRG code to demonstrate that the ground state for large system sizes can be determined efficiently. As our tensor network approach does not exhibit any sign problem, we can add a chemical potential and study real-time evolution.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10285'&gt;arXiv:2405.10285&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 16 May 2024 17:46:12 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Spectral functions with infinite projected entangled-pair states</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Juan Diego Arias Espinoza, Philippe Corboz&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Infinite projected entangled-pair states (iPEPS) provide a powerful tool to study two-dimensional strongly correlated systems directly in the thermodynamic limit. In this work, we extend the iPEPS toolbox by a method to efficiently evaluate non-equal time two-point correlators, enabling the computation of spectral functions. It is based on an iPEPS ansatz of the ground state in a large unit cell, with an operator applied in the center of the cell, which is evolved in real-time using the fast-full update method. At every time step, the two-point correlators within a cell are computed based on the corner transfer matrix renormalization group method. Benchmark results for the 2D transverse field Ising model show that the main features of the dynamical structure factor can already be reproduced at relatively small bond dimensions and unit cell sizes. The results for the magnon dispersion are found to be in good agreement with previous data obtained with the iPEPS excitation ansatz.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10628'&gt;arXiv:2405.10628&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 17 May 2024 08:43:55 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Reduced storage direct tensor ring decomposition for convolutional neural networks compression</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Mateusz Gabor, Rafał Zdunek&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are among the most widely used machine learning models for computer vision tasks, such as image classification. To improve the efficiency of CNNs, many CNNs compressing approaches have been developed. Low-rank methods approximate the original convolutional kernel with a sequence of smaller convolutional kernels, which leads to reduced storage and time complexities. In this study, we propose a novel low-rank CNNs compression method that is based on reduced storage direct tensor ring decomposition (RSDTR). The proposed method offers a higher circular mode permutation flexibility, and it is characterized by large parameter and FLOPS compression rates, while preserving a good classification accuracy of the compressed network. The experiments, performed on the CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets, clearly demonstrate the efficiency of RSDTR in comparison to other state-of-the-art CNNs compression approaches.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10802'&gt;arXiv:2405.10802&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 17 May 2024 14:16:40 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Tianyi Hao, Zichang He, Ruslan Shaydulin, Marco Pistoia, Swamit Tannu&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) are a broad class of algorithms with many applications in science and industry. Applying a VQA to a problem involves optimizing a parameterized quantum circuit by maximizing or minimizing a cost function. A particular challenge associated with VQAs is understanding the properties of associated cost functions. Having the landscapes of VQA cost functions can greatly assist in developing and testing new variational quantum algorithms, but they are extremely expensive to compute. Reconstructing the landscape of a VQA using existing techniques requires a large number of cost function evaluations, especially when the dimension or the resolution of the landscape is high. To address this challenge, we propose a low-rank tensor-completion-based approach for local landscape reconstruction. By leveraging compact low-rank representations of tensors, our technique can overcome the curse of dimensionality and handle high-resolution landscapes. We demonstrate the power of landscapes in VQA development by showcasing practical applications of analyzing penalty terms for constrained optimization problems and examining the probability landscapes of certain basis states.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10941'&gt;arXiv:2405.10941&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 17 May 2024 17:53:38 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>The Influence of Extended Interactions on Spin Dynamics in One-dimensional Cuprates</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11445</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Ta Tang, Daniel Jost, Brian Moritz, Thomas P. Devereaux&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Quasi-one-dimensional (1D) materials provide a unique platform for understanding the importance and influence of extended interactions on the physics of strongly correlated systems due to their relative structural simplicity and the existence of powerful theoretical tools well-adapted to one spatial dimension. Recently, this was highlighted by anomalous observations in the single-particle spectral function $A(q,\omega)$ of 1D cuprate chain compounds, measured by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), which were explained by the presence of a long-range attractive interaction. Such an extended interaction should leave its fingerprints on other observables, notably the dynamical spin structure factor $S(q,\omega)$, measured by neutron scattering or resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS). Starting from a simple Hubbard Hamiltonian in 1D and using time-dependent density matrix renormalization group (tDMRG) methods, we show that the presence of long-range attractive coupling, directly through an instantaneous Coulomb interaction $V$ or retarded electron-phonon ({\it el-ph}) coupling, can introduce significant spectral weight redistribution in $S(q,\omega)$ across a wide range of doping. This underscores the significant impact that extended interactions can have on dynamical correlations among particles, and the importance of properly incorporating this influence in modeling. Our results demonstrate that $S(q,\omega)$ can provide a sensitive experimental constraint, which complements ARPES measurements, in identifying key interactions in 1D cuprates, beyond the standard Hubbard model.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11445'&gt;arXiv:2405.11445&lt;/a&gt;] Published Sun, 19 May 2024 04:47:02 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Signatures of the Attractive Interaction in Spin Spectra of One-dimensional Cuprate Chains</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11472</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Zecheng Shen, Jiarui Liu, Hao-Xin Wang, Yao Wang&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Identifying the minimal model for cuprates is crucial for explaining the high-$T_c$ pairing mechanism. Recent photoemission experiments have suggested a significant near-neighbor attractive interaction $V$ in cuprate chains, favoring pairing instability. To determine its strength, we systematically investigate the dynamical spin structure factors $S(q,\omega)$ using the density matrix renormalization group. Our analysis quantitatively reveals a notable softening in the two-spinon continuum, particularly evident in the intense spectrum at large momentum. This softening is primarily driven by the renormalization of the superexchange interaction, as determined by a comparison with the slave-boson theory. We also demonstrate the feasibility of detecting this spectral shift in thin-film samples using resonant inelastic x-ray scattering. Therefore, this provides a distinctive fingerprint for the attractive interaction, motivating future experiments to unveil essential ingredients in cuprates.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11472'&gt;arXiv:2405.11472&lt;/a&gt;] Published Sun, 19 May 2024 07:43:38 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

Szymańska&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We introduce a novel method of efficiently simulating the non-equilibrium steady state of large many-body open quantum systems with highly non-local interactions, based on a variational Monte Carlo optimization of a matrix product operator ansatz. Our approach outperforms and offers several advantages over comparable algorithms, such as an improved scaling of the computational cost with respect to the bond dimension for periodic systems. We showcase the versatility of our approach by studying the phase diagrams and correlation functions of the dissipative quantum Ising model with collective dephasing and long-ranged power law interactions for spin chains of up to $N=100$ spins.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12044'&gt;arXiv:2405.12044&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 20 May 2024 14:10:53 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>YASTN: Yet another symmetric tensor networks; A Python library for abelian symmetric tensor network calculations</title>

Rams, Gabriela Wójtowicz, Aritra Sinha, Juraj Hasik&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We present an open-source tensor network Python library for quantum many-body simulations. At its core is an abelian-symmetric tensor, implemented as a sparse block structure managed by logical layer on top of dense multi-dimensional array backend. This serves as the basis for higher-level tensor networks algorithms, operating on matrix product states and projected entangled pair states, implemented here. Using appropriate backend, such as PyTorch, gives direct access to automatic differentiation (AD) for cost-function gradient calculations and execution on GPUs or other supported accelerators. We show the library performance in simulations with infinite projected entangled-pair states, such as finding the ground states with AD, or simulating thermal states of the Hubbard model via imaginary time evolution. We quantify sources of performance gains in those challenging examples allowed by utilizing symmetries.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12196'&gt;arXiv:2405.12196&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 20 May 2024 17:32:16 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Emergent quantum Majorana metal from a chiral spin liquid</title>

We propose that, in moderate fields, $\pi$-fluxes nucleate in the ground state and trap Majorana zero modes. As these fluxes proliferate with increasing field, the Majorana zero modes overlap creating an emergent $\mathbb{Z}_2$ quantum Majorana metallic state with a `Fermi surface' at zero energy. We further show that the Majorana spectral function captures the dynamical spin and dimer correlations obtained by the infinite Projected Entangled Pair States method, thereby validating our variational approach.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12278'&gt;arXiv:2405.12278&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 20 May 2024 18:00:01 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Theory of fractional quantum Hall liquids coupled to quantum light and emergent graviton-polaritons</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12292</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Zeno Bacciconi, Hernan Xavier, Iacopo Carusotto, Titas Chanda, Marcello Dalmonte&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Recent breakthrough experiments have demonstrated how it is now possible to explore the dynamics of quantum Hall states interacting with quantum electromagnetic cavity fields. While the impact of strongly coupled non-local cavity modes on integer quantum Hall physics has been recently addressed, its effects on fractional quantum Hall (FQH) liquids -- and, more generally, fractionalized states of matter -- remain largely unexplored. In this work, we develop a theoretical framework for the understanding of FQH states coupled to quantum light. In particular, combining analytical arguments with tensor network simulations, we study the dynamics of a $\nu=1/3$ Laughlin state in a single-mode cavity with finite electric field gradients. We find that the topological signatures of the FQH state remain robust against the non-local cavity vacuum fluctuations, as indicated by the endurance of the quantized Hall resistivity. The entanglement spectra, however, carry direct fingerprints of light-matter entanglement and topology, revealing peculiar polaritonic replicas of the $U(1)$ counting. As a further response to cavity fluctuations, we also find a squeezed FQH geometry, encoded in long-wavelength correlations. By exploring the low-energy excited spectrum inside the FQH phase, we identify a new neutral quasiparticle, the graviton-polariton, arising from the hybridization between quadrupolar FQH collective excitations (known as gravitons) and light. Pushing the light-matter interaction to ultra-strong coupling regimes we find other two important effects, a cavity vacuum-induced Stark shift for charged quasi-particles and a potential instability towards a density modulated stripe phase, competing against the phase separation driven by the Stark shift. Finally, we discuss the experimental implications of our findings and possible extension of our results to more complex scenarios.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12292'&gt;arXiv:2405.12292&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 20 May 2024 18:00:36 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Tensor-Train WENO Scheme for Compressible Flows</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12301</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Mustafa Engin Danis, Duc Truong, Ismael Boureima, Oleg Korobkin, Kim Rasmussen, Boian Alexandrov&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; In this study, we introduce a tensor-train (TT) finite difference WENO method for solving compressible Euler equations. In a step-by-step manner, the tensorization of the governing equations is demonstrated. We also introduce \emph{LF-cross} and \emph{WENO-cross} methods to compute numerical fluxes and the WENO reconstruction using the cross interpolation technique. A tensor-train approach is developed for boundary condition types commonly encountered in Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). The performance of the proposed WENO-TT solver is investigated in a rich set of numerical experiments. We demonstrate that the WENO-TT method achieves the theoretical $\text{5}^{\text{th}}$-order accuracy of the classical WENO scheme in smooth problems while successfully capturing complicated shock structures. In an effort to avoid the growth of TT ranks, we propose a dynamic method to estimate the TT approximation error that governs the ranks and overall truncation error of the WENO-TT scheme. Finally, we show that the traditional WENO scheme can be accelerated up to 1000 times in the TT format, and the memory requirements can be significantly decreased for low-rank problems, demonstrating the potential of tensor-train approach for future CFD application. This paper is the first study that develops a finite difference WENO scheme using the tensor-train approach for compressible flows. It is also the first comprehensive work that provides a detailed perspective into the relationship between rank, truncation error, and the TT approximation error for compressible WENO solvers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12301'&gt;arXiv:2405.12301&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 20 May 2024 18:08:34 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Communication protocols and QECC from the perspective of TQFT, Part II: QECCs as spacetimes</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12364</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Chris Fields, James F. Glazebrook, Antonino Marciano&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Topological quantum field theories (TQFTs) provide a general, minimal-assumption language for describing quantum-state preparation and measurement. They therefore provide a general language in which to express multi-agent communication protocols, e.g. local operations, classical communication (LOCC) protocols. In the accompanying Part I, we construct LOCC protocols using TQFT, and show that LOCC protocols induce quantum error-correcting codes (QECCs) on the agent-environment boundary. Such QECCs can be regarded as implementing or inducing the emergence of spacetimes on such boundaries. Here we investigate this connection between inter-agent communication and spacetime, exploiting different realizations of TQFT. We delve into TQFTs that support on their boundaries spin-networks as computational systems: these are known as topological quantum neural networks (TQNNs). TQNNs, which have a natural representation as tensor networks, implement QECC. We recognize into the HaPPY code a paradigmatic example. We then show how generic QECCs, as bulk-boundary codes, induce effective spacetimes. The effective spatial and temporal separations that take place in QECC enables LOCC protocols between spatially separated observers. We then consider the implementation of QECCs in BF and Chern-Simons theories, and show that QECC-induced spacetimes provide the classical redundancy required for LOCC. Finally, we consider topological M-theory as an implementation of QECC in higher spacetime dimensions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12364'&gt;arXiv:2405.12364&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 18 Mar 2024 08:03:52 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Observation of Unprecedented Fractional Magnetization Plateaus in a New Shastry-Sutherland Ising Compound</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12405</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Lalit Yadav, Afonso Rufino, Rabindranath Bag, Matthew Ennis, Jan Alexander Koziol, Clarina dela Cruz, Alexander I. Kolesnikov, V. Ovidiu Garlea, Keith M. Taddei, David Graf, Kai Phillip Schmidt, Frédéric Mila, Sara Haravifard&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Geometrically frustrated magnetic systems, such as those based on the Shastry-Sutherland lattice (SSL), offer a rich playground for exploring unconventional magnetic states. The delicate balance between competing interactions in these systems leads to the emergence of novel phases. We present the characterization of Er2Be2GeO7, an SSL compound with Er3+ ions forming orthogonal dimers separated by non-magnetic layers whose structure is invariant under the P-421m space group. Neutron scattering reveals an antiferromagnetic dimer structure at zero field, typical of Ising spins on that lattice and consistent with the anisotropic magnetization observed. However, magnetization measurements exhibit fractional plateaus at 1/4 and 1/2 of saturation, in contrast to the expected 1/3 plateau of the SSL Ising model. By comparing the energy of candidate states with ground-state lower bounds we show that this behavior requires spatially anisotropic interactions, leading to an anisotropic Shastry-Sutherland Ising Model (ASSLIM) symmetric under the Cmm2 space group. This anisotropy is consistent with the small orthorhombic distortion observed with single-crystal neutron diffraction. The other properties, including thermodynamics, which have been investigated theoretically using tensor networks, point to small residual interactions, potentially due to further couplings and quantum fluctuations. This study highlights Er2Ge2GeO7 as a promising platform for investigating exotic magnetic phenomena.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12405'&gt;arXiv:2405.12405&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 20 May 2024 23:02:40 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>APTT: An accuracy-preserved tensor-train method for the Boltzmann-BGK equation</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12524</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Zhitao Zhu, Chuanfu Xiao, Kejun Tang, Jizu Huang, Chao Yang&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Solving the Boltzmann-BGK equation with traditional numerical methods suffers from high computational and memory costs due to the curse of dimensionality. In this paper, we propose a novel accuracy-preserved tensor-train (APTT) method to efficiently solve the Boltzmann-BGK equation. A second-order finite difference scheme is applied to discretize the Boltzmann-BGK equation, resulting in a tensor algebraic system at each time step. Based on the low-rank TT representation, the tensor algebraic system is then approximated as a TT-based low-rank system, which is efficiently solved using the TT-modified alternating least-squares (TT-MALS) solver. Thanks to the low-rank TT representation, the APTT method can significantly reduce the computational and memory costs compared to traditional numerical methods. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that the APTT method maintains the same convergence rate as that of the finite difference scheme. The convergence rate and efficiency of the APTT method are validated by several benchmark test cases.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12524'&gt;arXiv:2405.12524&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 21 May 2024 06:27:25 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Unlocking Data-free Low-bit Quantization with Matrix Decomposition for KV Cache Compression</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12591</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Peiyu Liu, Ze-Feng Gao, Wayne Xin Zhao, Yipeng Ma, Tao Wang, Ji-Rong Wen&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Key-value~(KV) caching is an important technique to accelerate the inference of large language models~(LLMs), but incurs significant memory overhead. To compress the size of KV cache, existing methods often compromise precision or require extra data for calibration, limiting their practicality in LLM deployment. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{DecoQuant}, a novel data-free low-bit quantization technique based on tensor decomposition methods, to effectively compress KV cache. Our core idea is to adjust the outlier distribution of the original matrix by performing tensor decomposition, so that the quantization difficulties are migrated from the matrix to decomposed local tensors. Specially, we find that outliers mainly concentrate on small local tensors, while large tensors tend to have a narrower value range. Based on this finding, we propose to apply low-bit quantization to the large tensor, while maintaining high-precision representation for the small tensor. Furthermore, we utilize the proposed quantization method to compress the KV cache of LLMs to accelerate the inference and develop an efficient dequantization kernel tailored specifically for DecoQuant. Through extensive experiments, DecoQuant demonstrates remarkable efficiency gains, showcasing up to a $\sim$75\% reduction in memory footprint while maintaining comparable generation quality.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12591'&gt;arXiv:2405.12591&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 21 May 2024 08:35:10 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Adaptive sampling-based optimization of quantics tensor trains for noisy functions: applications to quantum simulations</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Kohtaroh Sakaue, Hiroshi Shinaoka, Rihito Sakurai&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Tensor cross interpolation (TCI) is a powerful technique for learning a tensor train (TT) by adaptively sampling a target tensor based on an interpolation formula. However, when the tensor evaluations contain random noise, optimizing the TT is more advantageous than interpolating the noise. Here, we propose a new method that starts with an initial guess of TT and optimizes it using non-linear least-squares by fitting it to measured points obtained from TCI. We use quantics TCI (QTCI) in this method and demonstrate its effectiveness on sine and two-time correlation functions, with each evaluated with random noise. The resulting QTT exhibits increased robustness against noise compared to the QTCI method. Furthermore, we employ this optimized QTT of the correlation function in quantum simulation based on pseudo-imaginary-time evolution, resulting in ground-state energy with higher accuracy than the QTCI or Monte Carlo methods.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12730'&gt;arXiv:2405.12730&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 21 May 2024 12:36:53 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Phase diagram of the antiferromagnetic $J_1$-$J_2$ spin-$1$ pyrochlore Heisenberg model</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12745</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Imre Hagymási, Nils Niggemann, Johannes Reuther&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We study the phase diagram of the antiferromagnetic $J_1$-$J_2$ Heisenberg model on the pyrochlore lattice with $S=1$ spins at zero and finite temperatures. We use a combination of complementary state-of-the-art quantum many-body approaches such as density matrix renormalization group (DMRG), density-matrix purification and pseudo-Majorana functional renormalization group (PMFRG). We present an efficient approach to preserve the applicability of the PMFRG for spin-1 systems at finite temperatures despite the inevitable presence of unphysical spin states. The good performance of our methods is first demonstrated for the nearest-neighbor pyrochlore Heisenberg model where the finite temperature behavior of the specific heat and uniform susceptibility show excellent agreement within PMFRG and density-matrix purification. Including an antiferromagnetic second neighbor coupling we find that the non-magnetic ground-state phase of the nearest neighbor model extents up to $J_2/J_1 \sim 0.02 $ within DMRG, beyond which magnetic $\boldsymbol{k}=0$ long-range order sets in. Our PMFRG calculations find the phase transition in a similar regime $J_2/J_1\sim 0.035(8)$ which, together with the DMRG result, provides a strong argument for the existence of a small but finite non-magnetic ground-state phase in the spin-1 pyrochlore Heisenberg model. We also discuss the origin of discrepancies between different versions of the functional renormalization group concerning the location of this phase transition.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12745'&gt;arXiv:2405.12745&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 21 May 2024 12:55:26 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Charge and Spin Sharpening Transitions on Dynamical Quantum Trees</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13894</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Xiaozhou Feng, Nadezhda Fishchenko, Sarang Gopalakrishnan, Matteo Ippoliti&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The dynamics of monitored systems can exhibit a measurement-induced phase transition (MIPT) between entangling and disentangling phases, tuned by the measurement rate. When the dynamics obeys a continuous symmetry, the entangling phase further splits into a fuzzy phase and a sharp phase based on the scaling of fluctuations of the symmetry charge. While the sharpening transition for Abelian symmetries is well understood analytically, no such understanding exists for the non- Abelian case. In this work, building on a recent analytical solution of the MIPT on tree-like circuit architectures (where qubits are repatedly added or removed from the system in a recursive pattern), we study entanglement and sharpening transitions in monitored dynamical quantum trees obeying U (1) and SU (2) symmetries. The recursive structure of tree tensor networks enables powerful analytical and numerical methods to determine the phase diagrams in both cases. In the U (1) case, we analytically derive a Fisher-KPP-like differential equation that allows us to locate the critical point and identify its properties. We find that the entanglement/purification and sharpening transitions generically occur at distinct measurement rates. In the SU (2) case, we find that the fuzzy phase is generic, and a sharp phase is possible only in the limit of maximal measurement rate. In this limit, we analytically solve the boundaries separating the fuzzy and sharp phases, and find them to be in agreement with exact numerical simulations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13894'&gt;arXiv:2405.13894&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 22 May 2024 18:06:15 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Coded Computing Meets Quantum Circuit Simulation: Coded Parallel Tensor Network Contraction Algorithm</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13946</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Jin Lee, Sofia Gonzalez-Garcia, Zheng Zhang, Haewon Jeong&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Parallel tensor network contraction algorithms have emerged as the pivotal benchmarks for assessing the classical limits of computation, exemplified by Google's demonstration of quantum supremacy through random circuit sampling. However, the massive parallelization of the algorithm makes it vulnerable to computer node failures. In this work, we apply coded computing to a practical parallel tensor network contraction algorithm. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to code tensor network contractions. Inspired by matrix multiplication codes, we provide two coding schemes: 2-node code for practicality in quantum simulation and hyperedge code for generality. Our 2-node code successfully achieves significant gain for $f$-resilient number compared to naive replication, proportional to both the number of node failures and the dimension product of sliced indices. Our hyperedge code can cover tensor networks out of the scope of quantum, with degraded gain in the exchange of its generality.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13946'&gt;arXiv:2405.13946&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 22 May 2024 19:21:37 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Inference in the Era of Tensor Networks and Differential Programming</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14060</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Martin Roa-Villescas, Xuanzhao Gao, Sander Stuijk, Henk Corporaal, Jin-Guo Liu&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Probabilistic inference is a fundamental task in modern machine learning. Recent advances in tensor network (TN) contraction algorithms have enabled the development of better exact inference methods. However, many common inference tasks in probabilistic graphical models (PGMs) still lack corresponding TN-based adaptations. In this work, we advance the connection between PGMs and TNs by formulating and implementing tensor-based solutions for the following inference tasks: (i) computing the partition function, (ii) computing the marginal probability of sets of variables in the model, (iii) determining the most likely assignment to a set of variables, and (iv) the same as (iii) but after having marginalized a different set of variables. We also present a generalized method for generating samples from a learned probability distribution. Our work is motivated by recent technical advances in the fields of quantum circuit simulation, quantum many-body physics, and statistical physics. Through an experimental evaluation, we demonstrate that the integration of these quantum technologies with a series of algorithms introduced in this study significantly improves the effectiveness of existing methods for solving probabilistic inference tasks.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14060'&gt;arXiv:2405.14060&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 22 May 2024 23:09:57 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Effects of Topological Boundary Conditions on Bell Nonlocality</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14587</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Patrick Emonts, Mengyao Hu, Albert Aloy, Jordi Tura&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Bell nonlocality is the resource that enables device-independent quantum information processing tasks. It is revealed through the violation of so-called Bell inequalities, indicating that the observed correlations cannot be reproduced by any local hidden variable model. While well explored in few-body settings, the question of which Bell inequalities are best suited for a given task remains quite open in the many-body scenario. One natural approach is to assign Bell inequalities to physical Hamiltonians, mapping their interaction graph to two-body, nearest-neighbor terms. Here, we investigate the effect of boundary conditions in a two-dimensional square lattice, which can induce different topologies in lattice systems. We find a relation between the induced topology and the Bell inequality's effectiveness in revealing nonlocal correlations. By using a combination of tropical algebra and tensor networks, we quantify their detection capacity for nonlocality. Our work can act as a guide to certify Bell nonlocality in many-qubit devices by choosing a suitable Hamiltonian and measuring its ground state energy; a task that many quantum experiments are purposely built for.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14587'&gt;arXiv:2405.14587&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 23 May 2024 13:58:50 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Loschmidt echo, emerging dual unitarity and scaling of generalized temporal entropies after quenches to the critical point</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14706</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Stefano Carignano, Luca Tagliacozzo&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We show how the Loschmidt echo of a product state after a quench to a conformal invariant critical point and its leading finite time corrections can be predicted by using conformal field theories (CFT). We check such predictions with tensor networks, finding excellent agreement. As a result, we can use the Loschmidt echo to extract the universal information of the underlying CFT including the central charge, the operator content, and its generalized temporal entropies. We are also able to predict and confirm an emerging dual-unitarity of the evolution at late times, since the spatial transfer matrix operator that evolves the system in space becomes unitary in such limit. Our results on the growth of temporal entropies also imply that, using state-of-the art tensor networks algorithms, such calculations only require resources that increase polynomially with the duration of the quench, thus providing an example of numerically efficiently solvable out-of-equilibrium scenario.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14706'&gt;arXiv:2405.14706&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 23 May 2024 15:40:37 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Classical dynamics of the antiferromagnetic Heisenberg $S=1/2$ spin ladder</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16315</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; David A. Dahlbom, Jinu Thomas, Steven Johnston, Kipton Barros, Cristian D. Batista&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We employ a classical limit grounded in SU(4) coherent states to investigate the temperature-dependent dynamical spin structure factor of the $S = 1/2$ ladder consisting of weakly coupled dimers. By comparing the outcomes of this classical approximation with density matrix renormalization group and exact diagonalization calculations in finite size ladders, we demonstrate that the classical dynamics offers an accurate approximation across the entire temperature range when the interdimer coupling is weak and a good approximation in the high temperature regime even when the interdimer coupling is strong. This agreement is achieved after appropriately rescaling the temperature axis and renormalizing expectation values to satisfy a quantum sum rule, following D. Dahlbom et al. [Phys. Rev. B 109, 014427 (2024)]. We anticipate the method will be particularly effective when applied to 2D and 3D lattices composed of weakly-coupled dimers, situations that remain challenging for alternative numerical methods.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16315'&gt;arXiv:2405.16315&lt;/a&gt;] Published Sat, 25 May 2024 17:45:51 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Tree-like process tensor contraction for automated compression of environments</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16548</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Moritz Cygorek, Brendon W. Lovett, Jonathan Keeling, Erik M. Gauger&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The algorithm "automated compression of environments" (ACE) [Nat. Phys. 18, 662 (2022)] provides a versatile way of simulating an extremely broad class of open quantum systems. This is achieved by encapsulating the influence of the environment, which is determined by the interaction Hamiltonian(s) and initial states, into compact process tensor matrix product operator (PT-MPO) representations. The generality of the ACE method comes at high numerical cost. Here, we demonstrate that orders-of-magnitude improvement of ACE is possible by changing the order of PT-MPO contraction from a sequential to a tree-like scheme. The problem of combining two partial PT-MPOs with large inner bonds is solved by a preselection approach. The drawbacks of the preselection approach are that the MPO compression is suboptimal and that it is more prone to error accumulation than sequential combination and compression. We therefore also identify strategies to mitigate these disadvantages by fine-tuning compression parameters. This results in a scheme that is similar in compression efficiency and accuracy to the original ACE algorithm, yet is significantly faster. Our numerical experiments reach similar conclusions for bosonic and fermionic test cases, suggesting that our findings are characteristic of the combination of PT-MPOs more generally.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16548'&gt;arXiv:2405.16548&lt;/a&gt;] Published Sun, 26 May 2024 12:32:57 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

Making use of the first- and second-order correlation functions, we find that the system supports the superfluid, super-Tonks-Girardeau, and quasicrystal phases according to the Luttinger liquid theory. We also map out the phase diagram on the parameter plane consisting the contact and dipolar interaction strengths. Furthermore, we compute the Luttinger parameter, the structure factor, and the momentum distribution of the system. Finally, we show that the predicted dipolar effect can potentially be observed in quasi-one-dimensional gases of polar molecules.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16553'&gt;arXiv:2405.16553&lt;/a&gt;] Published Sun, 26 May 2024 12:49:58 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Classifying 2D topological phases: mapping ground states to string-nets</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Isaac H. Kim, Daniel Ranard&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We prove the conjectured classification of topological phases in two spatial dimensions with gappable boundary, in a simplified setting. Two gapped ground states of lattice Hamiltonians are in the same quantum phase of matter, or topological phase, if they can be connected by a constant-depth quantum circuit. It is conjectured that the Levin-Wen string-net models exhaust all possible gapped phases with gappable boundary, and these phases are labeled by unitary modular tensor categories. We prove this under the assumption that every phase has a representative state with zero correlation length satisfying the entanglement bootstrap axioms, or a strict form of area law. Our main technical development is to transform these states into string-net states using constant-depth quantum circuits.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17379'&gt;arXiv:2405.17379&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 27 May 2024 17:36:17 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Approximately-symmetric neural networks for quantum spin liquids</title>

Yao&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We propose and analyze a family of approximately-symmetric neural networks for quantum spin liquid problems. These tailored architectures are parameter-efficient, scalable, and significantly outperform existing symmetry-unaware neural network architectures. Utilizing the mixed-field toric code and PXP Rydberg Hamiltonian models, we demonstrate that our approach is competitive with the state-of-the-art tensor network and quantum Monte Carlo methods. Moreover, at the largest system sizes (N = 480 for toric code, N=1584 for Rydberg PXP), our method allows us to explore Hamiltonians with sign problems beyond the reach of both quantum Monte Carlo and finite-size matrix-product states. The network comprises an exactly symmetric block following a non-symmetric block, which we argue learns a transformation of the ground state analogous to quasiadiabatic continuation. Our work paves the way toward investigating quantum spin liquid problems within interpretable neural network architectures.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17541'&gt;arXiv:2405.17541&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 27 May 2024 18:00:00 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

This recovers a result by Lyubashenko [arXiv:hep-th/9405168] obtained via generators and relations. Pulling back the modular functor for C to a 2-category of bordisms with orientation reversing involution cancels the gluing anomaly, and further pulling back to the original bordism category along a doubling functor leads to the modular functor for the Drinfeld centre Z(C).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18038'&gt;arXiv:2405.18038&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 28 May 2024 10:50:00 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Unified Low-rank Compression Framework for Click-through Rate Prediction</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18146</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Hao Yu, Minghao Fu, Jiandong Ding, Yusheng Zhou, Jianxin Wu&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Deep Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction models play an important role in modern industrial recommendation scenarios. However, high memory overhead and computational costs limit their deployment in resource-constrained environments. Low-rank approximation is an effective method for computer vision and natural language processing models, but its application in compressing CTR prediction models has been less explored. Due to the limited memory and computing resources, compression of CTR prediction models often confronts three fundamental challenges, i.e., (1). How to reduce the model sizes to adapt to edge devices? (2). How to speed up CTR prediction model inference? (3). How to retain the capabilities of original models after compression? Previous low-rank compression research mostly uses tensor decomposition, which can achieve a high parameter compression ratio, but brings in AUC degradation and additional computing overhead. To address these challenges, we propose a unified low-rank decomposition framework for compressing CTR prediction models. We find that even with the most classic matrix decomposition SVD method, our framework can achieve better performance than the original model. To further improve the effectiveness of our framework, we locally compress the output features instead of compressing the model weights. Our unified low-rank compression framework can be applied to embedding tables and MLP layers in various CTR prediction models. Extensive experiments on two academic datasets and one real industrial benchmark demonstrate that, with 3-5x model size reduction, our compressed models can achieve both faster inference and higher AUC than the uncompressed original models.

      <title>E$^2$M: Double Bounded $α$-Divergence Optimization for Tensor-based Discrete Density Estimation</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18220</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Kazu Ghalamkari, Jesper Løve Hinrich, Morten Mørup&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Tensor-based discrete density estimation requires flexible modeling and proper divergence criteria to enable effective learning; however, traditional approaches using $\alpha$-divergence face analytical challenges due to the $\alpha$-power terms in the objective function, which hinder the derivation of closed-form update rules. We present a generalization of the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm, called E$^2$M algorithm. It circumvents this issue by first relaxing the optimization into minimization of a surrogate objective based on the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, which is tractable via the standard EM algorithm, and subsequently applying a tensor many-body approximation in the M-step to enable simultaneous closed-form updates of all parameters. Our approach offers flexible modeling for not only a variety of low-rank structures, including the CP, Tucker, and Tensor Train formats, but also their mixtures, thus allowing us to leverage the strengths of different low-rank structures. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in classification and density estimation tasks.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18220'&gt;arXiv:2405.18220&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 28 May 2024 14:28:28 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Computational Characterization of Symmetry-Protected Topological Phases in Open Quantum Systems</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18364</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Riku Masui, Keisuke Totsuka&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; It is a challenging problem to correctly characterize the symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases in open quantum systems. As the measurement-based quantum computation (MBQC) utilizes non-trivial edge states of the SPT phases as the logical qubit, its computational power is closely tied to the non-trivial topological nature of the phases. In this paper, we propose to use the gate fidelity which is a measure of the computational power of the MBQC to identify the SPT phases in mixed-state settings. Specifically, we investigate the robustness of the Haldane phase by considering the MBQC on the Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki state subject to different types of noises. To illustrate how our criterion works, we analytically and numerically calculated the gate fidelity to find that its behavior depends crucially on whether the noises satisfy a certain symmetry condition with respect to the on-site $\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry. In particular, the fidelity for the identity gate, which is given by the sum of the non-local string order parameters, plays an important role. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a stronger symmetry conditions are required to be able to perform other (e.g., the $Z$-rotation gate) gates with high fidelity. By examining which unitary gates can be implemented with the MBQC on the decohered states, we can gain a useful insight into the richer structure of noisy SPT states that cannot be captured solely by the string order parameters.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18364'&gt;arXiv:2405.18364&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 28 May 2024 17:00:17 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Anomalous thermal broadening in the Shastry-Sutherland model and SrCu$_2($BO$_3)_2$</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18475</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Zhenjiu Wang, Paul McClarty, Dobromila Dankova, Andreas Honecker, Alexander Wietek&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The quantum magnet SrCu$_2($BO$_3)_2$ and its remarkably accurate theoretical description, the spin-$1/2$ Shastry-Sutherland model, host a variety of intriguing phenomena such as a dimer ground state with a nearly flat band of triplon excitations, a series of magnetization plateaux, and a possible pressure-induced deconfined quantum critical point. One open puzzle originating from inelastic neutron scattering and Raman experiments is the anomalous broadening of the triplon modes at relatively low temperatures compared to the triplon gap $\Delta$. We demonstrate that the experimentally observed broadening is captured by the Shastry-Sutherland model. To this end, we develop a numerical simulation method based on matrix-product states to simulate dynamical spectral functions at nonzero temperatures accurately. Perturbative calculations identify the origin of this phenomenon as a small energy scale compared to $\Delta$ between single triplon and bound triplon states at the experimentally relevant model parameters.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18475'&gt;arXiv:2405.18475&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 28 May 2024 18:00:02 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Finite-temperature Rydberg arrays: quantum phases and entanglement characterization</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18477</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Nora Reinić, Daniel Jaschke, Darvin Wanisch, Pietro Silvi, Simone Montangero&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; As one of the most prominent platforms for analog quantum simulators, Rydberg atom arrays are a promising tool for exploring quantum phases and transitions. While the ground state properties of one-dimensional Rydberg systems are already thoroughly examined, we extend the analysis towards the finite-temperature scenario. For this purpose, we develop a tensor network-based numerical toolbox for constructing the quantum many-body states at thermal equilibrium, which we exploit to probe classical correlations as well as entanglement monotones. We clearly observe ordered phases continuously shrinking due to thermal fluctuations at finite system sizes. Moreover, by examining the entanglement of formation and entanglement negativity of a half-system bipartition, we numerically confirm that a conformal scaling law of entanglement extends from the zero-temperature critical points into the low-temperature regime.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18477'&gt;arXiv:2405.18477&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 28 May 2024 18:00:03 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Spectroscopy and complex-time correlations using minimally entangled typical thermal states</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18484</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Zhenjiu Wang, Paul McClarty, Dobromila Dankova, Andreas Honecker, Alexander Wietek&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Tensor network states have enjoyed great success at capturing aspects of strong correlation physics. However, obtaining dynamical correlators at non-zero temperatures is generically hard even using these methods. Here, we introduce a practical approach to computing such correlators using minimally entangled typical thermal states (METTS). While our primary method directly computes dynamical correlators of physical operators in real time, we propose extensions where correlations are evaluated in the complex-time plane. The imaginary time component bounds the rate of entanglement growth and strongly alleviates the computational difficulty allowing the study of larger system sizes. To extract the physical correlator one must take the limit of purely real-time evolution. We present two routes to obtaining this information (i) via an analytic correlation function in complex time combined with a stochastic analytic continuation method to obtain the real-time limit and (ii) a hermitian correlation function that asymptotically captures the desired correlation function quantitatively without requiring effort of numerical analytic continuation. We show that these numerical techniques capture the finite-temperature dynamics of the Shastry-Sutherland model - a model of interacting spin one-half in two dimensions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18484'&gt;arXiv:2405.18484&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 28 May 2024 18:00:06 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Towards an exact electronic quantum many-body treatment of Kondo correlation in magnetic impurities</title>

Although it has served as the testing ground for quantum many-body methods for decades, the precise description of Kondo physics with material specificity remains challenging. Here, we present a systematic ab initio approach to converge towards an exact zero-temperature electronic treatment of Kondo correlations. Across a series of 3d transition metals, we extract Kondo temperatures matching the subtle experimental trends, with an accuracy exceeding that of standard models. We further obtain microscopic insight into the origin of these trends. More broadly, we demonstrate the possibility to start from fully ab initio many-body simulations and push towards the realm of converged predictions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18709'&gt;arXiv:2405.18709&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 29 May 2024 02:38:08 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>ACE: A general-purpose non-Markovian open quantum systems simulation toolkit based on process tensors</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19319</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Moritz Cygorek, Erik M. Gauger&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We describe a general-purpose computational toolkit for simulating open quantum systems, which provides numerically exact solutions for composites of zero-dimensional quantum systems that may be strongly coupled to multiple, quite general non-Markovian environments. It is based on process tensor matrix product operators (PT-MPOs), which efficiently encapsulate environment influences. The code features implementations of several PT-MPO algorithms, in particular, Automated Compression of Environments (ACE) for general environments comprised of independent modes as well as schemes for generalized spin boson models. The latter includes a divide-and-conquer scheme for periodic PT-MPOs, which enable million time step simulations for realistic models. PT-MPOs can be precalculated and reused for efficiently probing different time-dependent system Hamiltonians. They can also be stacked together and combined to provide numerically complete solutions of small networks of open quantum systems. The code is written in C++ and is fully controllable by configuration files, for which we have developed a versatile and compact human-readable format.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19319'&gt;arXiv:2405.19319&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 29 May 2024 17:50:50 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Non-equilibrium quantum Monte Carlo algorithm for stabilizer Renyi entropy in spin systems</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Zejun Liu, Bryan K. Clark&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Quantum magic, or nonstabilizerness, provides a crucial characterization of quantum systems, regarding the classical simulability with stabilizer states. In this work, we propose a novel and efficient algorithm for computing stabilizer Rényi entropy, one of the measures for quantum magic, in spin systems with sign-problem free Hamiltonians. This algorithm is based on the quantum Monte Carlo simulation of the path integral of the work between two partition function ensembles and it applies to all spatial dimensions and temperatures. We demonstrate this algorithm on the one and two dimensional transverse field Ising model at both finite and zero temperatures and show the quantitative agreements with tensor-network based algorithms. Furthermore, we analyze the computational cost and provide both analytical and numerical evidences for it to be polynomial in system size.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19577'&gt;arXiv:2405.19577&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 29 May 2024 23:59:02 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Phase Transitions in Quantum Many-Body Scars</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Peter Græns Larsen, Anne E. B. Nielsen&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We propose a type of phase transition in quantum many-body systems, which occurs in highly excited quantum many-body scar states, while most of the spectrum is largely unaffected. Such scar state phase transitions can be realized by embedding a matrix product state, known to undergo a phase transition, as a scar state into the thermal spectrum of a parent Hamiltonian. We find numerically that the mechanism for the scar state phase transition involves the formation or presence of low-entropy states at energies similar to the scar state in the vicinity of the phase transition point.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20113'&gt;arXiv:2405.20113&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 30 May 2024 14:51:01 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Recurrent neural network wave functions for Rydberg atom arrays on kagome lattice</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20384</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Mohamed Hibat-Allah, Ejaaz Merali, Giacomo Torlai, Roger G Melko, Juan Carrasquilla&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Rydberg atom array experiments have demonstrated the ability to act as powerful quantum simulators, preparing strongly-correlated phases of matter which are challenging to study for conventional computer simulations. A key direction has been the implementation of interactions on frustrated geometries, in an effort to prepare exotic many-body states such as spin liquids and glasses. In this paper, we apply two-dimensional recurrent neural network (RNN) wave functions to study the ground states of Rydberg atom arrays on the kagome lattice. We implement an annealing scheme to find the RNN variational parameters in regions of the phase diagram where exotic phases may occur, corresponding to rough optimization landscapes. For Rydberg atom array Hamiltonians studied previously on the kagome lattice, our RNN ground states show no evidence of exotic spin liquid or emergent glassy behavior. In the latter case, we argue that the presence of a non-zero Edwards-Anderson order parameter is an artifact of the long autocorrelations times experienced with quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations, and we show that autocorrelations can be systematically reduced by increasing numerical effort. This result emphasizes the utility of autoregressive models, such as RNNs, in conjunction with QMC, to explore Rydberg atom array physics on frustrated lattices and beyond.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20384'&gt;arXiv:2405.20384&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 30 May 2024 18:00:06 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Quantum and classical magnetic Bloch points</title>

Schmidt&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; A Bloch point represents a three-dimensional hedgehog singularity of a magnetic vector field in which the magnetization vanishes. However, standard micromagnetic theory, developed for magnetic moments of fixed lengths, lacks full applicability in studying such singularities. To address this gap, we study a Bloch point in a quantum Heisenberg model for the case of spin-1/2 particles. Performing an exact diagonalization of the Hamiltonian as well as using density matrix renormalization group techniques, we obtain the ground state, which can be used to recover the corresponding magnetization profile. Our findings demonstrate a variation of the spin length in the quantum model, leading smoothly to zero magnetization at the Bloch point. Our results indicate the necessity of generalizing the classical micromagnetic model by adding the third degree of freedom of the spins: the ability to change its length. To this end, we introduce the micromagnetic $\mathbb{S}_{3}$-model, which enables the description of magnets with and without Bloch point singularities.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20798'&gt;arXiv:2405.20798&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 31 May 2024 13:59:56 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Dirac spin liquid in quantum dipole arrays</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Marcus Bintz, Vincent S. Liu, Johannes Hauschild, Ahmed Khalifa, Shubhayu Chatterjee, Michael P. Zaletel, Norman Y. Yao&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We predict that the gapless $U(1)$ Dirac spin liquid naturally emerges in a two-dimensional array of quantum dipoles. In particular, we demonstrate that the dipolar XY model$\unicode{x2014}$realized in both Rydberg atom arrays and ultracold polar molecules$\unicode{x2014}$hosts a quantum spin liquid ground state on the kagome lattice. Large-scale density matrix renormalization group calculations indicate that this spin liquid exhibits signatures of gapless, linearly-dispersing spinons, consistent with the $U(1)$ Dirac spin liquid. We identify a route to adiabatic preparation via staggered on-site fields and demonstrate that this approach can prepare cold spin liquids within experimentally realistic time-scales. Finally, we propose a number of novel signatures of the Dirac spin liquid tailored to near-term quantum simulators, including termination-dependent edge modes and the Friedel response to a local perturbation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00098'&gt;arXiv:2406.00098&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 31 May 2024 18:00:01 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Learning topological states from randomized measurements using variational tensor network tomography</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Yanting Teng, Rhine Samajdar, Katherine Van Kirk, Frederik Wilde, Subir Sachdev, Jens Eisert, Ryan Sweke, Khadijeh Najafi&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Learning faithful representations of quantum states is crucial to fully characterizing the variety of many-body states created on quantum processors. While various tomographic methods such as classical shadow and MPS tomography have shown promise in characterizing a wide class of quantum states, they face unique limitations in detecting topologically ordered two-dimensional states. To address this problem, we implement and study a heuristic tomographic method that combines variational optimization on tensor networks with randomized measurement techniques. Using this approach, we demonstrate its ability to learn the ground state of the surface code Hamiltonian as well as an experimentally realizable quantum spin liquid state. In particular, we perform numerical experiments using MPS ansätze and systematically investigate the sample complexity required to achieve high fidelities for systems of sizes up to $48$ qubits. In addition, we provide theoretical insights into the scaling of our learning algorithm by analyzing the statistical properties of maximum likelihood estimation. Notably, our method is sample-efficient and experimentally friendly, only requiring snapshots of the quantum state measured randomly in the $X$ or $Z$ bases. Using this subset of measurements, our approach can effectively learn any real pure states represented by tensor networks, and we rigorously prove that random-$XZ$ measurements are tomographically complete for such states.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00193'&gt;arXiv:2406.00193&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 31 May 2024 21:05:43 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Nicolas Allegra&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Modern quantum optical systems such as photonic quantum computers and quantum imaging devices require great precision in their designs and implementations in the hope to realistically exploit entanglement and reach a real quantum advantage. The theoretical and experimental explorations and validations of these systems are greatly dependent on the precision of our classical simulations. However, as Hilbert spaces increases, traditional computational methods used to design and optimize these systems encounter hard limitations due to the quantum curse of dimensionally. To address this challenge, we propose an approach based on neural and tensor networks to approximate the exact unitary evolution of closed entangled systems in a precise, efficient and quantum consistent manner. By training the networks with a reasonably small number of examples of quantum dynamics, we enable efficient parameter estimation in larger Hilbert spaces, offering an interesting solution for a great deal of quantum metrology problems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01157'&gt;arXiv:2406.01157&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 03 Jun 2024 09:51:25 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>From high-dimensional committors to reactive insights</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Nils E. Strand, Schuyler B. Nicholson, Hadrien Vroylandt, Todd R. Gingrich&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Transition path theory (TPT) offers a powerful formalism for extracting the rate and mechanism of rare dynamical transitions between metastable states. Most applications of TPT either focus on systems with modestly sized state spaces or use collective variables to try to tame the curse of dimensionality. Increasingly, expressive function approximators like neural networks and tensor networks have shown promise in computing the central object of TPT, the committor function, even in very high dimensional systems. That progress prompts our consideration of how one could use such a high dimensional function to extract mechanistic insight. Here, we present and illustrate a straightforward but powerful way to track how individual dynamical coordinates evolve during a reactive event. The strategy, which involves marginalizing the reactive ensemble, naturally captures the evolution of the dynamical coordinate's distribution, not just its mean reactive behavior.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01452'&gt;arXiv:2406.01452&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 03 Jun 2024 15:42:31 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

Upon adjusting parameters of local unitary gates, the dynamics can be either chaotic or integrable. The latter corresponds to a generalization of the space-time discretized (Trotterized) higher-spin quantum Heisenberg chain. We demonstrate that breaking of space-reflection symmetry results in a drift in the dynamical spin susceptibility. Remarkably, we find a universal drift velocity given by a simple formula which, at zero average magnetization, depends only on the values of SU(2) Casimir invariants associated with local spins. In the integrable case, the drift velocity formula is confirmed analytically based on the exact solution of thermodynamic Bethe ansatz equations. Finally, by inspecting the large fluctuations of the time-integrated current between two halves of the system in stationary maximum-entropy states, we demonstrate violation of the Gallavotti-Cohen symmetry, implying that such states cannot be regarded as equilibrium ones. We show that the scaled cumulant generating function of the time-integrated current instead obeys a generalized fluctuation relation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01571'&gt;arXiv:2406.01571&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 03 Jun 2024 17:51:36 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Pivoting through the chiral-clock family</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Nick G. Jones, Abhishodh Prakash, Paul Fendley&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The Onsager algebra, invented to solve the two-dimensional Ising model, can be used to construct conserved charges for a family of integrable $N$-state chiral clock models. We show how it naturally gives rise to a "pivot" procedure for this family of chiral Hamiltonians. These Hamiltonians have an anti-unitary CPT symmetry that when combined with the usual $\mathbb{Z}_N$ clock symmetry gives a non-abelian dihedral symmetry group $D_{2N}$. We show that this symmetry gives rise to symmetry-protected topological (SPT) order in this family for all even $N$, and representation-SPT (RSPT) physics for all odd $N$. The simplest such example is a next-nearest-neighbour chain generalising the spin-1/2 cluster model, an SPT phase of matter. We derive a matrix-product state representation of its fixed-point ground state along with the ensuing entanglement spectrum and symmetry fractionalisation. We analyse a rich phase diagram combining this model with the Onsager-integrable chiral Potts chain, and find trivial, symmetry-breaking and (R)SPT orders, as well as extended gapless regions. For odd $N$, the phase transitions are "unnecessarily" critical from the SPT point of view.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01680'&gt;arXiv:2406.01680&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 03 Jun 2024 18:00:01 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Phase diagram and topology of the XXZ chain with alternating bonds and staggered magnetic field</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01760</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; B. F. Márquez, N. Aucar Boidi, K. Hallberg, A. A. Aligia&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The XXZ spin-half chain has Heisenberg exchange interactions $J_z$ ($J_\perp$) in the $z$ ($x,y$) direction. The model has a transition from the spin-fluid phase for $-J_\perp &lt; J_z &lt; J_\perp$ to the N\'{e}el phase for $J_z &gt; J_\perp &gt;0$. When bond alternation $\delta$ is included, the N\'{e}el phase transitions to the dimer phase for a finite value of $\delta$. We determine the phase diagram using simple topological indicators related to the polarization of both spins. When a staggered magnetic field $B$ is included, a contour plot of these indicators as a function of $\delta$ and $B$ determine the amount of topological quantized spin pumping around closed circuits in the $(\delta,B)$ plane.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01760'&gt;arXiv:2406.01760&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 03 Jun 2024 19:58:45 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Gifts from long-range interaction: Emergent gapless topological behaviors in quantum spin chain</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01974</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Sheng Yang, Hai-Qing Lin, Xue-Jia Yu&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Topology in condensed matter physics is typically associated with a bulk energy gap. However, recent research has shifted focus to topological phases without a bulk energy gap, exhibiting nontrivial gapless topological behaviors. In this letter, we explore a cluster Ising chain with long-range antiferromagnetic interactions that decay as a power law with the distance. Using complementary numerical and analytical techniques, we demonstrate that long-range interactions can unambiguously induce an algebraic topological phase and a topological Gaussian universality, both of which exhibit nontrivial gapless topological behaviors. Our study not only provides a platform to investigate the fundamental physics of quantum many-body systems but also offers a novel route toward searching for gapless topological phases in realistic quantum simulators.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01974'&gt;arXiv:2406.01974&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 04 Jun 2024 05:18:44 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Quantum colored strings in the hole-doped $t$-$J_z$ model</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01980</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Jia-Long Wang, Shi-Jie Hu, Xue-Feng Zhang&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The stripe phase, an intertwined order observed in high-temperature superconductors, is regarded as playing a key role in elucidating the underlying mechanism of superconductivity, especially in cuprates. Following Jan Zaanen's early scenario, the filled charge stripe, with one hole per unit cell of the charge order, can be taken as the interactive elastic quantum strings of holes, stabilized by $\pi$-phase shifts between neighboring magnetic domains. However, this scenario is challenging to explain, particularly in terms of electron pairing, which necessitates hole pairs. In this work, we propose a new effective model for describing the stripe phase in the hole-doped $t$-$J_z$ model. With respect to the antiferromagnetic background, the model comprises three types of color-labeled point-defects coupling to an effective spin field, so named as ``colored string". Comparing with numerical results from large-scale density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations, we find semi-quantitative agreement in local hole density, magnetic moment, and the newly proposed spectrum features of the effective spin field. By systematically analyzing the hole-density distribution and the scaling of groundstate energy at different system sizes, we determine the effective core radius and the effective hopping amplitude of the quantum string. Furthermore, the local pinning field can be finely adjusted to drag the quantum string, offering a potential method for detecting it in optical lattices. At last, we further demonstrate the partially-filled stripe with less than one hole per unit cell of the charge order can also be well described by the effective theory.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01980'&gt;arXiv:2406.01980&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 04 Jun 2024 05:46:59 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

Stutz, Michael Foss-Feig&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Empirical evidence for a gap between the computational powers of classical and quantum computers has been provided by experiments that sample the output distributions of two-dimensional quantum circuits. Many attempts to close this gap have utilized classical simulations based on tensor network techniques, and their limitations shed light on the improvements to quantum hardware required to frustrate classical simulability. In particular, quantum computers having in excess of $\sim 50$ qubits are primarily vulnerable to classical simulation due to restrictions on their gate fidelity and their connectivity, the latter determining how many gates are required (and therefore how much infidelity is suffered) in generating highly-entangled states. Here, we describe recent hardware upgrades to Quantinuum's H2 quantum computer enabling it to operate on up to $56$ qubits with arbitrary connectivity and $99.843(5)\%$ two-qubit gate fidelity. Utilizing the flexible connectivity of H2, we present data from random circuit sampling in highly connected geometries, doing so at unprecedented fidelities and a scale that appears to be beyond the capabilities of state-of-the-art classical algorithms. The considerable difficulty of classically simulating H2 is likely limited only by qubit number, demonstrating the promise and scalability of the QCCD architecture as continued progress is made towards building larger machines.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02501'&gt;arXiv:2406.02501&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 04 Jun 2024 17:20:30 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Tensor Network Space-Time Spectral Collocation Method for Solving the Nonlinear Convection Diffusion Equation</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02505</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Dibyendu Adak, M. Engin Danis, Duc P. Truong, Kim Ø. Rasmussen, Boian S. Alexandrov&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Spectral methods provide highly accurate numerical solutions for partial differential equations, exhibiting exponential convergence with the number of spectral nodes. Traditionally, in addressing time-dependent nonlinear problems, attention has been on low-order finite difference schemes for time discretization and spectral element schemes for spatial variables. However, our recent developments have resulted in the application of spectral methods to both space and time variables, preserving spectral convergence in both domains. Leveraging Tensor Train techniques, our approach tackles the curse of dimensionality inherent in space-time methods. Here, we extend this methodology to the nonlinear time-dependent convection-diffusion equation. Our discretization scheme exhibits a low-rank structure, facilitating translation to tensor-train (TT) format. Nevertheless, controlling the TT-rank across Newton's iterations, needed to deal with the nonlinearity, poses a challenge, leading us to devise the "Step Truncation TT-Newton" method. We demonstrate the exponential convergence of our methods through various benchmark examples. Importantly, our scheme offers significantly reduced memory requirement compared to the full-grid scheme.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02505'&gt;arXiv:2406.02505&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 04 Jun 2024 17:24:10 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Efficient Leverage Score Sampling for Tensor Train Decomposition</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Vivek Bharadwaj, Beheshteh T. Rakhshan, Osman Asif Malik, Guillaume Rabusseau&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Tensor Train~(TT) decomposition is widely used in the machine learning and quantum physics communities as a popular tool to efficiently compress high-dimensional tensor data. In this paper, we propose an efficient algorithm to accelerate computing the TT decomposition with the Alternating Least Squares (ALS) algorithm relying on exact leverage scores sampling. For this purpose, we propose a data structure that allows us to efficiently sample from the tensor with time complexity logarithmic in the tensor size. Our contribution specifically leverages the canonical form of the TT decomposition. By maintaining the canonical form through each iteration of ALS, we can efficiently compute (and sample from) the leverage scores, thus achieving significant speed-up in solving each sketched least-square problem. Experiments on synthetic and real data on dense and sparse tensors demonstrate that our method outperforms SVD-based and ALS-based algorithms.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02749'&gt;arXiv:2406.02749&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 04 Jun 2024 20:08:24 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

While the tensor network is now regarded as a powerful tool in quantum computer simulation, there still exists a complexity issue in updating the tensors. This work studies the tensor updates simplification in the context of the tensor network based quantum computer simulation. According to the numerical simulations, a method called simple update, also originated in quantum many-body spin systems, shows a good balance of the fidelity and the computational complexity.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03010'&gt;arXiv:2406.03010&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 05 Jun 2024 07:18:28 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Vertex Representation of Hyperbolic Tensor Networks</title>

The tensors form a network of regular $p$-sided polygons ($p&gt;4$) with the coordination number four. The response to multi-state spin systems on the hyperbolic TN is analyzed for their entire parameter space. We show that entanglement entropy is sensitive to distinguish various hyperbolic geometries whereas other thermodynamic quantities are not. We test the numerical accuracy of vertex TNs in the phase transitions of the first, second, and infinite order at the point of maximal entanglement entropy. The hyperbolic structure of TNs induces non-critical properties in the bulk although boundary conditions significantly affect the total free energy in the thermodynamic limit. Thus developed vertex-type TN can be used for the lowest-energy quantum states on the hyperbolic lattices.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03426'&gt;arXiv:2406.03426&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 05 Jun 2024 16:25:21 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

The stationary point on a fixed rank matrix product state manifold is obtained via a joint optimization on the Grassman manifold [Phys. Rev. Lett. 117, 210402] together with swap gates controlled permutations. The minimization of the global quantity, the block entropy area, guarantees that the method fulfills all criteria with respect to partial derivatives.

      <title>Towards a Real-Time Computation of Timelike Hadronic Vacuum Polarization and Light-by-Light Scattering: Schwinger Model Tests</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03536</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; João Barata, Kazuki Ikeda, Swagato Mukherjee, Jonathan Raghoonanan&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Hadronic vacuum polarization (HVP) and light-by-light scattering (HLBL) are crucial for evaluating the Standard Model predictions concerning the muon's anomalous magnetic moment. However, direct first-principle lattice gauge theory-based calculations of these observables in the timelike region remain challenging. Discrepancies persist between lattice quantum chromodynamics (QCD) calculations in the spacelike region and dispersive approaches relying on experimental data parametrization from the timelike region. Here, we introduce a methodology employing 1+1-dimensional quantum electrodynamics (QED), i.e. the Schwinger Model, to investigate the HVP and HLBL. To that end, we use both tensor network techniques, specifically matrix product states, and classical emulators of digital quantum computers. Demonstrating feasibility in a simplified model, our approach sets the stage for future endeavors leveraging digital quantum computers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03536'&gt;arXiv:2406.03536&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 05 Jun 2024 18:00:01 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Operator dynamics and entanglement in space-time dual Hadamard lattices</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03781</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Pieter W. Claeys, Austen Lamacraft&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Many-body quantum dynamics defined on a spatial lattice and in discrete time -- either as stroboscopic Floquet systems or quantum circuits -- has been an active area of research for several years. Being discrete in space and time, a natural question arises: when can such a model be viewed as evolving unitarily in space as well as in time? Models with this property, which sometimes goes by the name space-time duality, have been shown to have a number of interesting features related to entanglement growth and correlations. One natural way in which the property arises in the context of (brickwork) quantum circuits is by choosing dual unitary gates: two site operators that are unitary in both the space and time directions. We introduce a class of models with $q$ states per site, defined on the square lattice by a complex partition function and paremeterized in terms of $q\times q$ Hadamard matrices, that have the property of space-time duality. These may interpreted as particular dual unitary circuits or stroboscopically evolving systems, and generalize the well studied self-dual kicked Ising model. We explore the operator dynamics in the case of Clifford circuits, making connections to Clifford cellular automata [J. Math. Phys. 49, 112104 (2008)] and in the $q\to\infty$ limit to the classical spatiotemporal cat model of many body chaos [Nonlinearity 34, 2800 (2021)]. We establish integrability and the corresponding conserved charges for a large subfamily and show how the long-range entanglement protocol discussed in the recent paper [Phys. Rev. B 105, 144306 (2022)] can be reinterpreted in purely graphical terms and directly applied here.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03781'&gt;arXiv:2406.03781&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 06 Jun 2024 06:48:43 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Subspace Clustering in Wavelet Packets Domain</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03819</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Ivica Kopriva, Damir Sersic&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Subspace clustering (SC) algorithms utilize the union of subspaces model to cluster data points according to the subspaces from which they are drawn. To better address separability of subspaces and robustness to noise we propose a wavelet packet (WP) based transform domain subspace clustering. Depending on the number of resolution levels, WP yields several representations instantiated in terms of subbands. The first approach combines original and subband data into one complementary multi-view representation. Afterward, we formulate joint representation learning as a low-rank MERA tensor network approximation problem. That is motivated by the strong representation power of the MERA network to capture complex intra/inter-view dependencies in corresponding self-representation tensor. In the second approach, we use a self-stopping computationally efficient method to select the subband with the smallest clustering error on the validation set. When existing SC algorithms are applied to the chosen subband, their performance is expected to improve. Consequently, both approaches enable the re-use of SC algorithms developed so far. Improved clustering performance is due to the dual nature of subbands as representations and filters, which is essential for noise suppression. We exemplify the proposed WP domain approach to SC on the MERA tensor network and eight other well-known linear SC algorithms using six well-known image datasets representing faces, digits, and objects. Although WP domain-based SC is a linear method, it achieved clustering performance comparable with some best deep SC algorithms and outperformed many other deep SC algorithms by a significant margin. That is in particular case for the WP MERA SC algorithm. On the COIL100 dataset, it achieves an accuracy of 87.45% and outperforms the best deep SC competitor in the amount of 14.75%.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03819'&gt;arXiv:2406.03819&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 06 Jun 2024 07:49:11 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Topological Phases in Half-Integer Higher Spin $J_1$-$J_2$ Heisenberg Chains</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04030</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Sahinur Reja, Satoshi Nishimoto&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We study the ground state properties of antiferromagnetic $J_1$-$J_2$ chains with half-integer spins ranging from $S=\frac{3}{2}$ to $S=\frac{11}{2}$ using the density-matrix renormalization group method. We map out the ground-state phase diagrams as a function of $\frac{J_2}{J_1}$ containing topological phases with alternating $\frac{2S-1}{2}$ and $\frac{2S+1}{2}$ valence bonds. We identify these topological phases and their boundaries by calculating the string order parameter, the dimer order parameter, and the spin gap for those high-$S$ systems in thermodynamic limit (finite size scaling). We find that these topological regions narrow down inversely with $S$ and converge to a single point at $\frac{J_2}{J_1}=\frac{1}{4}$ in the classical limit -- a critical threshold between commensurate and incommensurate orders. In addition, we extend the discussion of the Majumder-Ghosh state, previously noted only for $S=\frac{1}{2}$, and speculate its possible presence as a ground state in half-integer high spin systems over a substantial range of $\frac{J_2}{J_1}$ values.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04030'&gt;arXiv:2406.04030&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 06 Jun 2024 13:00:11 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>On the zeros of partition functions with multi-spin interactions</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04179</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Alexander Barvinok&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Let $X_1, \ldots, X_n$ be probability spaces, let $X$ be their direct product, let $\phi_1, \ldots, \phi_m: X \longrightarrow {\Bbb C}$ be random variables, each depending only on a few coordinates of a point $x=(x_1, \ldots, x_n)$, and let $f=\phi_1 + \ldots + \phi_m$. The expectation $E\thinspace e^{\lambda f}$, where $\lambda \in {\Bbb C}$, appears in statistical physics as the partition function of a system with multi-spin interactions, and also in combinatorics and computer science, where it is known as the partition function of edge-coloring models, tensor network contractions or a Holant polynomial. Assuming that each $\phi_i$ is 1-Lipschitz in the Hamming metric of $X$, that each $\phi_i(x)$ depends on at most $r \geq 2$ coordinates $x_1, \ldots, x_n$ of $x \in X$, and that for each $j$ there are at most $c \geq 1$ functions $\phi_i$ that depend on the coordinate $x_j$, we prove that $E\thinspace e^{\lambda f} \ne 0$ provided $| \lambda | \leq \ (3 c \sqrt{r-1})^{-1}$ and that the bound is sharp up to a constant factor. Taking a scaling limit, we prove a similar result for functions $\phi_1, \ldots, \phi_m: {\Bbb R}^n \longrightarrow {\Bbb C}$ that are 1-Lipschitz in the $\ell^1$ metric of ${\Bbb R}^n$ and where the expectation is taken with respect to the standard Gaussian measure in ${\Bbb R}^n$. As a corollary, the value of the expectation can be efficiently approximated, provided $\lambda$ lies in a slightly smaller disc.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04179'&gt;arXiv:2406.04179&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 06 Jun 2024 15:36:13 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Coarse-To-Fine Tensor Trains for Compact Visual Representations</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04332</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Sebastian Loeschcke, Dan Wang, Christian Leth-Espensen, Serge Belongie, Michael J. Kastoryano, Sagie Benaim&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The ability to learn compact, high-quality, and easy-to-optimize representations for visual data is paramount to many applications such as novel view synthesis and 3D reconstruction. Recent work has shown substantial success in using tensor networks to design such compact and high-quality representations. However, the ability to optimize tensor-based representations, and in particular, the highly compact tensor train representation, is still lacking. This has prevented practitioners from deploying the full potential of tensor networks for visual data. To this end, we propose 'Prolongation Upsampling Tensor Train (PuTT)', a novel method for learning tensor train representations in a coarse-to-fine manner. Our method involves the prolonging or `upsampling' of a learned tensor train representation, creating a sequence of 'coarse-to-fine' tensor trains that are incrementally refined. We evaluate our representation along three axes: (1). compression, (2). denoising capability, and (3). image completion capability. To assess these axes, we consider the tasks of image fitting, 3D fitting, and novel view synthesis, where our method shows an improved performance compared to state-of-the-art tensor-based methods.

      <title>Magnetic response and antiferromagnetic correlations in strained kagome ribbons</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; R. F. P. Costa, E. Vernek, S. E. Ulloa&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We study the physics of the strong-coupling Hubbard model in a kagome lattice ribbon under mechanical tension and half-filling. It is known that in the absence of strain, the lattice symmetry of the system and strong electronic interactions induce magnetic frustration. As uniaxial strain is applied, the ribbon exhibits various configurations with energy oscillations that depend on the direction of the strain axis. The ground states are obtained by density-matrix renormalization-group calculations. We find that the system is characterized by strong antiferromagnetic bonds distributed throughout the lattice in directions and patterns that depend on strain directions and may coexist with easily polarizable sites that are only weakly correlated to their neighbors. We identify frustration and correlation measures that follow the strain and interaction dependence of the system well. These results illustrate that strain-dependent magnetic susceptibility could be explored experimentally to help probe the role of symmetry and interactions in these systems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04514'&gt;arXiv:2406.04514&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 06 Jun 2024 21:17:58 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Emergence of topological states in relaxation dynamics of interacting bosons</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Wang Huang, Xu-Chen Yang, Rui Cao, Ying-Hai Wu, Jianmin Yuan, Yongqiang Li&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Topological concepts have been employed to understand the ground states of many strongly correlated systems, but it is still quite unclear if and how topology manifests itself in the relaxation dynamics. Here we uncover emergent topological phenomena in the time evolution of far-from-equilibrium one-dimensional interacting bosons. Beginning with simple product states, the system evolves into long-time stationary states with high energy that are nonthermal for a wide range of parameters, and they exhibit nonlocal string correlation that is characteristic of the symmetry-protected topological ground state of the Hamiltonian. In contrast, no topological feature is found in the stationary state as long as the system thermalizes. This difference is further corroborated by the distinct behaviour of quantum entanglement and edge states of the system. Our theoretical prediction can be examined by current experimental techniques and paves the way for a more comprehensive understanding of topological phases in nonequilibrium settings.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04536'&gt;arXiv:2406.04536&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 06 Jun 2024 22:12:29 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Magnetism of $\mathrm{NaYbS_2}$: From finite temperatures to ground state</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04819</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Weizhen Zhuo, Zheng Zhang, Mingtai Xie, Anmin Zhang, Jianting Ji, Feng Jin, Qingming Zhang&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Rare-earth chalcogenide compounds $\mathrm{ARECh_2}$ (A = alkali or monovalent metal, RE = rare earth, Ch = O, S, Se, Te) are a large family of quantum spin liquid (QSL) candidate materials. $\mathrm{NaYbS_2}$ is a representative member of the family. Several key issues on $\mathrm{NaYbS_2}$, particularly how to determine the highly anisotropic spin Hamiltonian and describe the magnetism at finite temperatures and the ground state, remain to be addressed. In this paper, we conducted an in-depth and comprehensive study on the magnetism of $\mathrm{NaYbS_2}$ from finite temperatures to the ground state. Firstly, we successfully detected three crystalline electric field (CEF) excitation energy levels using low-temperature Raman scattering technique. Combining them with the CEF theory and magnetization data, we worked out the CEF parameters, CEF energy levels, and CEF wavefunctions. We further determined a characteristic temperature of $\sim$40 K, above which the magnetism is dominated by CEF excitations while below which the spin-exchange interactions play a main role. The characteristic temperature has been confirmed by the temperature-dependent electron spin resonance (ESR) linewidth. Low-temperature ESR experiments on the dilute magnetic doped crystal of $\mathrm{NaYb_{0.1}Lu_{0.9}S_2}$ further helped us to determine the accurate $g$-factor. Next, we quantitatively obtained the spin-exchange interactions in the spin Hamiltonian by consistently simulating the magnetization and specific heat data. Finally, the above studies allow us to explore the ground state magnetism of $\mathrm{NaYbS_2}$ by using the density matrix renormalization group. We combined numerical calculations and experimental results to demonstrate that the ground state of $\mathrm{NaYbS_2}$ is a Dirac-like QSL.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04819'&gt;arXiv:2406.04819&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 07 Jun 2024 10:39:07 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Operator entanglement growth quantifies complexity of cellular automata</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Wout Merbis, Calvin Bakker&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Cellular automata (CA) exemplify systems where simple local interaction rules can lead to intricate and complex emergent phenomena at large scales. The various types of dynamical behavior of CA are usually categorized empirically into Wolfram's complexity classes. Here, we propose a quantitative measure, rooted in quantum information theory, to categorize the complexity of classical deterministic cellular automata. Specifically, we construct a Matrix Product Operator (MPO) of the transition matrix on the space of all possible CA configurations. We find that the growth of entropy of the singular value spectrum of the MPO reveals the complexity of the CA and can be used to characterize its dynamical behavior. This measure defines the concept of operator entanglement entropy for CA, demonstrating that quantum information measures can be meaningfully applied to classical deterministic systems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04895'&gt;arXiv:2406.04895&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 07 Jun 2024 12:43:01 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Kondo Screening and Indirect Magnetic Exchange through a Conventional Superconductor Studied by the Density-Matrix Renormalization Group</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05029</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Cassian Plorin, Michael Potthoff&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The competition between the Kondo screening and indirect magnetic exchange in systems with two magnetic impurities coupled to a conventional s-wave superconductor gives rise to a nontrivial ground-state phase diagram. Here, we utilize the density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) method and exploit the non-abelian spin-SU(2) symmetry to study the phase diagram for two quantum-spin-$\frac12$ impurities locally exchange coupled to large one-dimensional chains. The nonlocal inter-impurity exchange is treated as an emergent Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) coupling. We find qualitatively different phase diagrams for impurity spins coupled to sites with odd or even distances $d$ on the chain and a partial-Kondo-screened spin-doublet phase that extends over the whole range of local exchange couplings $J$ in the limit of weak superconducting pairing strength $\Delta$. Our numerical studies are complemented by exact diagonalization of small (quantum-box) systems and by perturbative-in-$J$ computations of the $d$ and $\Delta$ dependent RKKY interaction. It is thereby demonstrated that the specific system geometry is essential for our understanding of magnetic impurity interactions in superconducting hosts, and thus for insights into the control of quantum-state properties in nanoparticle systems and topological superconductivity.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05029'&gt;arXiv:2406.05029&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 07 Jun 2024 15:47:55 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Quantum nuclear dynamics on a distributed set of ion-trap quantum computing systems</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05197</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Anurag Dwivedi, A. J. Rasmusson, Philip Richerme, Srinivasan S. Iyengar&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Quantum nuclear dynamics with wavepacket time-evolution is classically intractable and viewed as a promising avenue for quantum information processing. Here, we use an IonQ 11-qubit trapped-ion quantum computer, Harmony, to study the quantum wavepacket dynamics of a shared-proton within a short-strong hydrogen-bonded system. We also provide the first application of distributed quantum computing for chemical dynamics problems, where the distributed set of quantum processes is constructed using a tensor network formalism. For a range of initial states, we experimentally drive the ion-trap system to emulate the quantum nuclear wavepacket as it evolves along the potential surface generated from electronic structure. Following the experimental creation of the nuclear wavepacket, we extract measurement observables such as its time-dependent spatial projection and its characteristic vibrational frequencies to good agreement with classical results. Vibrational eigenenergies obtained from quantum computational are in agreement with those obtained from classical simulations to within a fraction of a kcal/mol, thus suggesting chemical accuracy. Our approach opens a new paradigm for studying the quantum chemical dynamics and vibrational spectra of molecules and also provides the first demonstration for parallel quantum computation on a distributed set of ion-trap quantum computers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05197'&gt;arXiv:2406.05197&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 07 Jun 2024 18:27:50 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Entanglement with neutral atoms in the simulation of nonequilibrium dynamics of one-dimensional spin models</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05291</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Anupam Mitra&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Quantum entanglement is a key ingredient for quantum information processing with capabilities beyond that of classical computation. We study the generation and role of entanglement in the dynamics of spin-1/2 models, both for the design of quantum gates for general-purpose quantum computation and for quantum simulation of interacting spin models. We introduce the neutral atom M{\o}lmer-S{\o}rensen gate, involving rapid adiabatic Rydberg dressing interleaved in a spin-echo sequence. We show its robustness to quasi-static experimental imperfections and favorable scaling with the time-energy scales of Rydberg-mediated entanglement generation. In quantum simulation, we consider critical behavior in quench dynamics of transverse field Ising models. Using matrix product states to calculate the dynamics, we find that order parameters, critical point, and critical exponents can be estimated using modest bond dimensions. Considering the role of chaos and equilibration in quenches, we find that local observables are well approximated either due to low global entanglement or the proximity of local marginals to the maximally mixed state. These findings highlight the challenge of identifying relevant quantum phenomena that remain inaccessible to classical descriptions. Understanding the regimes where classical descriptions fail but remain accessible to pre-fault tolerant quantum hardware will help inform the design of future quantum information processors&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05291'&gt;arXiv:2406.05291&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 07 Jun 2024 23:29:16 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Bipartite reweight-annealing algorithm of quantum Monte Carlo to extract large-scale data of entanglement entropy and its derivative</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05324</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Zhe Wang, Zhiyan Wang, Yi-Ming Ding, Bin-Bin Mao, Zheng Yan&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We propose a quantum Monte Carlo scheme capable of extracting large-scale data of Rényi entanglement entropy (EE) with high precision and low technical barrier. Instead of directly computing the ratio of two partition functions within different space-time manifolds, we obtain them separately via a reweight-annealing scheme and connect them from the ratio of a reference point. The incremental process can thus be designed along a path of real physical parameters within this framework, and all intermediates are meaningful EEs corresponding to these parameters. In a single simulation, we can obtain many multiples ($\sim \beta L^d$, d is the space dimension) of EEs, which has been proven to be powerful for determining phase transition points and critical exponents. Additionally, we introduce a formula to calculate the derivative of EE without resorting to numerical differentiation from dense EE data. This formula only requires computing the difference of energies in different space-time manifolds. The calculation of EE and its derivative becomes much cheaper and simpler in our scheme. We then demonstrate the feasibility of using EE and its derivative to find phase transition points, critical exponents, and various phases.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05324'&gt;arXiv:2406.05324&lt;/a&gt;] Published Sat, 08 Jun 2024 02:27:45 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Global Sensitivity Analysis of Uncertain Parameters in Bayesian Networks</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05764</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Rafael Ballester-Ripoll, Manuele Leonelli&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Traditionally, the sensitivity analysis of a Bayesian network studies the impact of individually modifying the entries of its conditional probability tables in a one-at-a-time (OAT) fashion. However, this approach fails to give a comprehensive account of each inputs' relevance, since simultaneous perturbations in two or more parameters often entail higher-order effects that cannot be captured by an OAT analysis. We propose to conduct global variance-based sensitivity analysis instead, whereby $n$ parameters are viewed as uncertain at once and their importance is assessed jointly. Our method works by encoding the uncertainties as $n$ additional variables of the network. To prevent the curse of dimensionality while adding these dimensions, we use low-rank tensor decomposition to break down the new potentials into smaller factors. Last, we apply the method of Sobol to the resulting network to obtain $n$ global sensitivity indices. Using a benchmark array of both expert-elicited and learned Bayesian networks, we demonstrate that the Sobol indices can significantly differ from the OAT indices, thus revealing the true influence of uncertain parameters and their interactions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05764'&gt;arXiv:2406.05764&lt;/a&gt;] Published Sun, 09 Jun 2024 12:36:38 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Computational and Statistical Guarantees for Tensor-on-Tensor Regression with Tensor Train Decomposition</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06002</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Zhen Qin, Zhihui Zhu&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Recently, a tensor-on-tensor (ToT) regression model has been proposed to generalize tensor recovery, encompassing scenarios like scalar-on-tensor regression and tensor-on-vector regression. However, the exponential growth in tensor complexity poses challenges for storage and computation in ToT regression. To overcome this hurdle, tensor decompositions have been introduced, with the tensor train (TT)-based ToT model proving efficient in practice due to reduced memory requirements, enhanced computational efficiency, and decreased sampling complexity. Despite these practical benefits, a disparity exists between theoretical analysis and real-world performance. In this paper, we delve into the theoretical and algorithmic aspects of the TT-based ToT regression model. Assuming the regression operator satisfies the restricted isometry property (RIP), we conduct an error analysis for the solution to a constrained least-squares optimization problem. This analysis includes upper error bound and minimax lower bound, revealing that such error bounds polynomially depend on the order $N+M$. To efficiently find solutions meeting such error bounds, we propose two optimization algorithms: the iterative hard thresholding (IHT) algorithm (employing gradient descent with TT-singular value decomposition (TT-SVD)) and the factorization approach using the Riemannian gradient descent (RGD) algorithm. When RIP is satisfied, spectral initialization facilitates proper initialization, and we establish the linear convergence rate of both IHT and RGD.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06002'&gt;arXiv:2406.06002&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 10 Jun 2024 03:51:38 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Learning effective Hamiltonians for adaptive time-evolution quantum algorithms</title>

Recent advances have outlined protocols enabling more efficient adaptive Trotter protocols, which have been shown to exhibit a controlled error in the dynamics of local observables and correlation functions. However, it has remained open to which extent the errors on the actual generator of the dynamics, i.e., the target many-body Hamiltonian, remain controlled. Here, we propose to use quantum Hamiltonian learning to numerically obtain the effective Hamiltonian and apply it on the recently introduced ADA-Trotter algorithm as a concrete demonstration. Our key observation is that deviations from the target generator remain bounded on all simulation times. This result suggests that the ADA-Trotter not only generates reliable digital quantum simulation of local dynamics, but also controllably approximates the global quantum state of the target system. Our proposal is sufficiently general and readily applicable to other adaptive time-evolution algorithms.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06198'&gt;arXiv:2406.06198&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 10 Jun 2024 11:50:38 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Compute Better Spent: Replacing Dense Layers with Structured Matrices</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06248</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Shikai Qiu, Andres Potapczynski, Marc Finzi, Micah Goldblum, Andrew Gordon Wilson&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Dense linear layers are the dominant computational bottleneck in foundation models. Identifying more efficient alternatives to dense matrices has enormous potential for building more compute-efficient models, as exemplified by the success of convolutional networks in the image domain. In this work, we systematically explore structured matrices as replacements for dense matrices. We show that different structures often require drastically different initialization scales and learning rates, which are crucial to performance, especially as models scale. Using insights from the Maximal Update Parameterization, we determine the optimal scaling for initialization and learning rates of these unconventional layers. Finally, we measure the scaling laws of different structures to compare how quickly their performance improves with compute. We propose a novel matrix family containing Monarch matrices, the Block Tensor-Train (BTT), which we show performs better than dense matrices for the same compute on multiple tasks. On CIFAR-10/100 with augmentation, BTT achieves exponentially lower training loss than dense when training MLPs and ViTs. BTT matches dense ViT-S/32 performance on ImageNet-1k with 3.8 times less compute and is more efficient than dense for training small GPT-2 language models.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06248'&gt;arXiv:2406.06248&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 10 Jun 2024 13:25:43 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Parametric kernel low-rank approximations using tensor train decomposition</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Abraham Khan, Arvind K. Saibaba&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Computing low-rank approximations of kernel matrices is an important problem with many applications in scientific computing and data science. We propose methods to efficiently approximate and store low-rank approximations to kernel matrices that depend on certain hyperparameters. The main idea behind our method is to use multivariate Chebyshev function approximation along with the tensor train decomposition of the coefficient tensor. The computations are in two stages: an offline stage, which dominates the computational cost and is parameter-independent, and an online stage, which is inexpensive and instantiated for specific hyperparameters. A variation of this method addresses the case that the kernel matrix is symmetric and positive semi-definite. The resulting algorithms have linear complexity in terms of the sizes of the kernel matrices. We investigate the efficiency and accuracy of our method on parametric kernel matrices induced by various kernels, such as the Matérn kernel, through various numerical experiments. Our methods have speedups up to $200\times$ in the online time compared to other methods with similar complexity and comparable accuracy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06344'&gt;arXiv:2406.06344&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 10 Jun 2024 15:03:19 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Feasibility of accelerating homogeneous catalyst discovery with fault-tolerant quantum computers</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Nicole Bellonzi, Alexander Kunitsa, Joshua T. Cantin, Jorge A. Campos-Gonzalez-Angulo, Maxwell D. Radin, Yanbing Zhou, Peter D. Johnson, Luis A. Martínez-Martínez, Mohammad Reza Jangrouei, Aritra Sankar Brahmachari, Linjun Wang, Smik Patel, Monika Kodrycka, Ignacio Loaiza, Robert A. Lang, Alán Aspuru-Guzik, Artur F. Izmaylov, Jhonathan Romero Fontalvo, Yudong Cao&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The industrial manufacturing of chemicals consumes a significant amount of energy and raw materials. In principle, the development of new catalysts could greatly improve the efficiency of chemical production. However, the discovery of viable catalysts can be exceedingly challenging because it is difficult to know the efficacy of a candidate without experimentally synthesizing and characterizing it. This study explores the feasibility of using fault-tolerant quantum computers to accelerate the discovery of homogeneous catalysts for nitrogen fixation, an industrially important chemical process. It introduces a set of ground-state energy estimation problems representative of calculations needed for the discovery of homogeneous catalysts and analyzes them on three dimensions: economic utility, classical hardness, and quantum resource requirements. For the highest utility problem considered, two steps of a catalytic cycle for the generation of cyanate anion from dinitrogen, the economic utility of running these computations is estimated to be $200,000, and the required runtime for double-factorized phase estimation on a fault-tolerant superconducting device is estimated under conservative assumptions to be 139,000 QPU-hours. The computational cost of an equivalent DMRG calculation is estimated to be about 400,000 CPU-hours. These results suggest that, with continued development, it will be feasible for fault-tolerant quantum computers to accelerate the discovery of homogeneous catalysts.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06335'&gt;arXiv:2406.06335&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 10 Jun 2024 14:52:20 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Rigorous lower bound on dynamical exponents in gapless frustration-free systems</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06415</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Rintaro Masaoka, Tomohiro Soejima, Haruki Watanabe&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; This work rigorously establishes a universal lower bound $z\ge2$ for the dynamical exponent in frustration-free quantum many-body systems whose ground states exhibit power-law decaying correlations. The derivation relies on the Gosset-Huang inequality, providing a unified framework applicable across various lattice structures and spatial dimensions, independent of specific boundary conditions. Remarkably, our result can be applied to prove new bounds for dynamics of classical stochastic processes. Specifically, we utilize a well-established mapping from the time evolution of local Markov processes with detailed balance to that of frustration-free quantum Hamiltonians, known as Rokhsar-Kivelson Hamiltonians. This proves $z \ge 2$ for such Markov processes, which is an improvement over existing bounds. Beyond these applications, the quantum analysis of the $z\ge2$ bound is further broadened to include systems exhibiting hidden correlations, which may not be evident from purely local operators.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06415'&gt;arXiv:2406.06415&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 10 Jun 2024 16:08:33 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Inclusive reactions from finite Minkowski spacetime correlation functions</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06877</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Marco A. Carrillo, Raúl A. Briceño, Alexandru M. Sturzu&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The need to determine scattering amplitudes of few-hadron systems for arbitrary kinematics expands a broad set of subfields of modern-day nuclear and hadronic physics. In this work, we expand upon previous explorations on the use of real-time methods, like quantum computing or tensor networks, to determine few-body scattering amplitudes. Such calculations must be performed in a finite Minkowski spacetime, where scattering amplitudes are not well defined. Our previous work presented a conjecture of a systematically improvable estimator for scattering amplitudes constructed from finite-volume correlation functions. Here we provide further evidence that the prescription works for larger kinematic regions than previously explored as well as a broader class of scattering amplitudes. Finally, we devise a new method for estimating the order of magnitude of the error associated with finite time separations needed for such calculations. In units of the lightest mass of the theory, we find that to constrain amplitudes using real-time methods within $\mathcal{O}(10\%)$, the spacetime volumes must satisfy $mL \sim \mathcal{O}(10-10^2)$ and $ mT\sim \mathcal{O}(10^2-10^4)$.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06877'&gt;arXiv:2406.06877&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 11 Jun 2024 01:39:24 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Optimal Qubit Mapping Search for Encoding Classical Data into Matrix Product State Representation with Minimal Loss</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06935</link>

This research paper investigates techniques to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of MPS representations specifically designed for encoding classical data. Based on the observations that MPS truncation error depends on the pattern of the classical data, we devised an algorithm that finds optimal qubit mapping for given classical data, thereby improving the efficiency and fidelity of the MPS representation. Furthermore, we evaluate the impact of the optimized MPS in the context of quantum classifiers, demonstrating their enhanced performance compared to the conventional mapping. This improvement confirms the efficacy of the proposed techniques for encoding classical data into quantum states. MPS representation combined with optimal qubit mapping can pave a new way for more efficient and accurate quantum data representation and processing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06935'&gt;arXiv:2406.06935&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 11 Jun 2024 04:19:05 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>MPSDynamics.jl: Tensor network simulations for finite-temperature (non-Markovian) open quantum system dynamics</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07052</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Thibaut Lacroix, Brieuc Le Dé, Angela Riva, Angus J. Dunnett, Alex W. Chin&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The MPSDynamics.jl package provides an easy to use interface for performing open quantum systems simulations at zero and finite temperatures. The package has been developed with the aim of studying non-Markovian open system dynamics using the state-of-the-art numerically exact Thermalized-Time Evolving Density operator with Orthonormal Polynomials Algorithm (T-TEDOPA) based on environment chain mapping. The simulations rely on a tensor network representation of the quantum states as matrix product states (MPS) and tree tensor network (TTN) states. Written in the Julia programming language, MPSDynamics.jl is a versatile open-source package providing a choice of several variants of the Time-Dependent Variational Principle (TDVP) method for time evolution (including novel bond-adaptive one-site algorithms). The package also provides strong support for the measurement of single and multi-site observables, as well as the storing and logging of data, which makes it a useful tool for the study of many-body physics. It currently handles long-range interactions, time-dependent Hamiltonians, multiple environments, bosonic and fermionic environments, and joint system-environment observables.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07052'&gt;arXiv:2406.07052&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 11 Jun 2024 08:34:59 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Simulation of the Dissipative Dynamics of Strongly Interacting NV Centers with Tensor Networks</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08108</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Jirawat Saiphet, Daniel Braun&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; NV centers in diamond are a promising platform for highly sensitive quantum sensors for magnetic fields and other physical quantities. The quest for high sensitivity combined with high spatial resolution leads naturally to dense ensembles of NV centers, and hence to strong, long-range interactions between them. Hence, simulating strongly interacting NVs becomes essential. However, obtaining the exact dynamics for a many-spin system is a challenging task due to the exponential scaling of the Hilbert space dimension, a problem that is exacerbated when the system is modelled as an open quantum system. In this work, we employ the Matrix Product Density Operator (MPDO) method to represent the many-body mixed state and to simulate the dynamics of an ensemble of NVs in the presence of strong long-range couplings due to dipole-dipole forces. We benchmark different time-evolution algorithms in terms of numerical accuracy and stability against time evolution based on exact numerical diagonalization. Subsequently, we simulate the dynamics in the strong interaction regime, and study the impact of decoherence on the accuracy of the MPDO method. Lastly, we investigate the dynamics of quantum Fisher information and discuss under what circumstances a strong interaction can improve sensitivity for magnetic field sensing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08108'&gt;arXiv:2406.08108&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 12 Jun 2024 11:40:14 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Exact Correlation Functions for Dual-Unitary Quantum circuits with exceptional points</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08338</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Xi-Dan Hu, Dan-Bo Zhang&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Dual-unitary quantum circuits can provide analytic spatiotemporal correlation functions of local operators from transfer matrices, enriching our understanding of quantum dynamics with exact solutions. Nevertheless, a full understanding is still lacking as the case of a non-diagonalizable transfer matrix with exceptional points has less been investigated. In this paper, we give an inverse approach for constructing dual-unitary quantum circuits with exceptional points in the transfer matrices, by establishing relations between transfer matrices and local unitary gates. As a consequence of the coalesce of eigenvectors, the correlation functions exhibit a polynomial modified exponential decay, which is significantly different from pure exponential decay, especially at early stages. Moreover, we point out that the Hamiltonian evolution of a kicked XXZ spin chain can be approximately mapped to a dual-unitary circuit with exceptional points by Trotter decomposition. Finally, we investigate the dynamics approaching and at exceptional points, showing that behaviors of correlation functions are distinct by Laplace transformation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08338'&gt;arXiv:2406.08338&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 12 Jun 2024 15:44:29 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Mean Field Study of Superconductivity in the Square Lattice $t$-$J$ Model with Three-Site Hopping</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08780</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Ke Yang, Qianqian Chen, Lei Qiao, Zheng Zhu&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; It remains an open question whether the two-dimensional single-band pure Hubbard model and its related pure $t$-$J$ model truly capture the superconducting order in cuprates. Recent numerical studies on this issue have raised a notable disparity in superconducting order between the pure Hubbard model and the pure $t$-$J$ model. Inspired by these, we investigate the role of the three-site hopping term in $d$-wave superconductivity, such a term is usually neglected in the effective Hamiltonian of the Hubbard model, though its amplitude is of the same order as the superexchange coupling $J$ in the $t$-$J$ model. Our slave-boson mean-field solution demonstrates the suppression of $d$-wave superconducting order by incorporating the three-site hopping term, consistent with numerical observations by the density matrix renormalization group. This suppression could be understood as a result of competition between superexchange interaction and three-site hopping, the former favors $d$-wave pairing while the latter favors $s$-wave pairing. We also discussed its role in quasiparticle dispersion and boson-condensation temperature. Our findings may offer an alternative understanding of the recent numerical contrasting findings in the strong coupling regime: the absent or weak superconductivity in the pure Hubbard model, while the robust superconductivity in the $t$-$J$ model without including the three-site hopping term.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08780'&gt;arXiv:2406.08780&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 13 Jun 2024 03:21:00 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

This model suffers from the sign problem, which has prevented us from investigating the properties of the phase transition. We investigate the properties of the phase transition by changing the chemical potential $\mu$ at a fixed coupling of $\beta$. We determine the transition point $\mu_{\rm c}$ and the critical exponent $\nu$ from the $\mu$ dependence of the number density in the thermodynamic limit. The dynamical critical exponent $z$ is also extracted from the scaling behavior of the temporal correlation length as a function of $\mu$.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08865'&gt;arXiv:2406.08865&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 13 Jun 2024 07:06:46 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Bayesian inference of general noise-model parameters from the syndrome statistics of surface codes</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08981</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Takumi Kobori, Synge Todo&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The performance of error correction in the surface code can be enhanced by leveraging the knowledge of the noise model for physical qubits. To provide accurate noise information to the decoder in parallel with quantum computation, an adaptive estimation of the noise model based on syndrome measurement statistics is an effective approach. While noise model estimation based on syndrome measurement statistics is well-established for Pauli noise, it remains unexplored for more complex and realistic scenarios such as amplitude damping which cannot be represented as a Pauli channel. In this paper, we propose Bayesian inference methods for general noise models, integrating a tensor network simulator of surface code, which can efficiently simulate various noise models, with Monte Carlo sampling techniques. For stationary noise, we propose a method based on the Markov chain Monte Carlo. For time-varying noise, which is a more realistic scenario, we introduce another method based on the sequential Monte Carlo. We present numerical results of applying our proposed methods to various noise models, such as static, time-varying, and nonuniform cases, and evaluate their performance in detail.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08981'&gt;arXiv:2406.08981&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 13 Jun 2024 10:26:04 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Approximate Contraction of Arbitrary Tensor Networks with a Flexible and Efficient Density Matrix Algorithm</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09769</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Linjian Ma, Matthew Fishman, Miles Stoudenmire, Edgar Solomonik&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Tensor network contractions are widely used in statistical physics, quantum computing, and computer science. We introduce a method to efficiently approximate tensor network contractions using low-rank approximations, where each intermediate tensor generated during the contractions is approximated as a low-rank binary tree tensor network. The proposed algorithm has the flexibility to incorporate a large portion of the environment when performing low-rank approximations, which can lead to high accuracy for a given rank. Here, the environment refers to the remaining set of tensors in the network, and low-rank approximations with larger environments can generally provide higher accuracy. For contracting tensor networks defined on lattices, the proposed algorithm can be viewed as a generalization of the standard boundary-based algorithms. In addition, the algorithm includes a cost-efficient density matrix algorithm for approximating a tensor network with a general graph structure into a tree structure, whose computational cost is asymptotically upper-bounded by that of the standard algorithm that uses canonicalization. Experimental results indicate that the proposed technique outperforms previously proposed approximate tensor network contraction algorithms for multiple problems in terms of both accuracy and efficiency.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09769'&gt;arXiv:2406.09769&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 14 Jun 2024 07:13:52 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Optimisation of ultrafast singlet fission in 1D rings towards unit efficiency</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Francesco Campaioli, Alice Pagano, Daniel Jaschke, Simone Montangero&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Singlet fission (SF) is an electronic transition that in the last decade has been under the spotlight for its applications in optoelectronics, from photovoltaics to spintronics. Despite considerable experimental and theoretical advancements, optimising SF in materials like multichromophoric systems and molecular crystals remains a challenge, due to the complexity of its analysis beyond perturbative methods. Here, we tackle the case of 1D rings, aiming to promote singlet fission and prevent its back-reaction. We study ultrafast SF non-perturbatively, by numerically solving a spin-boson model, via exact propagation and tensor network methods. By optimising over a parameter space relevant to organic molecular materials, we identify two classes of solutions that can take SF efficiency beyond 85% in the non-dissipative (coherent) regime, and to 99% when exciton-phonon interactions can be tuned. After discussing the experimental feasibility of the optimised solutions, we conclude by proposing that this approach can be extended to a wider class of optoelectronic optimisation problems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09847'&gt;arXiv:2406.09847&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 14 Jun 2024 08:54:38 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

Feiguin, Julian Rincon&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We present a class of one-dimensional generic spinless fermion lattice Hamiltonians that express quasi-Fermi liquid physics, manifesting both Luttinger and Fermi liquid features due to solely irrelevant interactions. Using infinite matrix product state techniques, we unveil its universal structure by calculating static and dynamic responses. Key features include a finite discontinuity in the momentum distribution at the Fermi level, despite power-law singularities in the spectral function protected by particle-hole symmetry. Away from half-filling Landau quasiparticles emerge. Charge dynamics show either high-energy bound states or concentration of spectral weight within the continuum for attractive or repulsive interactions, respectively. These universal features are realized across multiple models and energy scales thus reifying the quasi-Fermi liquid as a unique paradigm for one-dimensional fermions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10063'&gt;arXiv:2406.10063&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 14 Jun 2024 14:21:16 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

Ignacio Cirac&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Matrix-product unitaries (MPU) are 1D tensor networks describing time evolution and unitary symmetries of quantum systems, while their action on states by construction preserves the entanglement area law. MPU which are formed by a single repeated tensor are known to coincide with 1D quantum cellular automata (QCA), i.e., unitaries with an exact light cone. However, this correspondence breaks down for MPU with open boundary conditions, even if the resulting operator is translation-invariant. Such unitaries can turn short- to long-range correlations and thus alter the underlying phase of matter. Here we make the first steps towards a theory of MPU with uniform bulk but arbitrary boundary. In particular, we study the structure of a subclass with a direct-sum form which maximally violates the QCA property. We also consider the general case of MPU formed by site-dependent (nonuniform) tensors and show a correspondence between MPU and locally maximally entanglable states.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10195'&gt;arXiv:2406.10195&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 14 Jun 2024 17:29:04 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Entanglement in $(1+1)$-dimensional Free Scalar Field Theory: Tiptoeing between Continuum and Discrete Formulations</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11031</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Dimitrios Katsinis, Georgios Pastras&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We review some classic works on ground state entanglement entropy in $(1+1)$-dimensional free scalar field theory. We point out identifications between the methods for the calculation of entanglement entropy and we show how the formalism developed for the discretized theory can be utilized in order to obtain results in the continuous theory. We specify the entanglement spectrum and we calculate the entanglement entropy for the theory defined on an interval of finite length $L$. Finally, we derive the modular Hamiltonian directly, without using the modular flow, via the continuous limit of the expressions obtained in the discretized theory. In a specific coordinate system, the modular Hamiltonian assumes the form of a free field Hamiltonian on the Rindler wedge.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11031'&gt;arXiv:2406.11031&lt;/a&gt;] Published Sun, 16 Jun 2024 18:00:42 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Resolving Geometric Excitations of Fractional Quantum Hall States</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11195</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Yang Liu, Tongzhou Zhao, T. Xiang&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The quantum dynamics of the intrinsic metric profoundly influence the neutral excitations in the fractional quantum Hall system, as established by Haldane in 2011 \cite{Haldane2011}, and further evidenced by a recent two-photon experiment \cite{Liang2024}. Despite these advancements, a comprehensive understanding of the dynamic properties of these excitations, especially at long wavelengths, continues to elude interest. In this study, we employ tensor-network methods to investigate the neutral excitations of the Laughlin and Moore-Read states on an infinite cylinder. This investigation deepens our understanding of the excitation spectrum in regions where traditional methods do not work effectively. The spectral functions for both states reveal the presence of $S=-2$ geometric excitations. For the first time, we unveil the complex spectra of both neutral fermion and bosonic Girvin-MacDonald-Platzman modes within the excitation continuum by calculating the three-particle density response function for the Moore-Read state. Our findings support the hypothesis of emergent supersymmetry and highlight the potential for detecting neutral fermions in future experiments.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11195'&gt;arXiv:2406.11195&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 17 Jun 2024 04:05:39 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>A spin chain with non-Hermitian $\mathscr{PT}-$symmetric boundary couplings: exact solution, dissipative Kondo effect, and phase transitions on the edge</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10334</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Pradip Kattel, Parameshwar R. Pasnoori, J. H. Pixley, Natan Andrei&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We construct an exactly solvable $\mathscr{PT}-$symmetric non-Hermitian model where a spin$-\frac{1}{2}$ isotropic quantum Heisenberg spin chain is coupled to two spin$-\frac{1}{2}$ Kondo impurities at its boundaries with coupling strengths that are complex conjugates of each other. Solving the model by means of a combination of the Bethe Ansatz and density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) techniques, we show that the model exhibits three distinct boundary phases: a $\mathscr{PT}$ symmetric phase with a dissipative Kondo effect, a phase with bound modes and spontaneously broken $\mathscr{PT}$ symmetry, and a phase with an effectively unscreened spin (i.e. a free local moment). In the Kondo and the unscreened phases, the $\mathscr{PT}-$symmetry is unbroken, and hence all states have real energies, whereas in the bound mode phases, in addition to the states with real energies, there exist states with complex energy eigenvalues that appear in complex conjugate pairs, signaling spontaneous breaking of the $\mathscr{PT}-$symmetry. The exact solution is used to provide an accessible benchmark for DMRG with a non-Hermitian matrix product operator representation that demonstrates an accuracy comparable to its Hermitian limit thus showing the power of DMRG to handle non-Hermitian many body calculations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10334'&gt;arXiv:2406.10334&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 14 Jun 2024 18:00:01 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Theory of charge-6e condensed phase in Kagome lattice superconductors</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11447</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Tong-Yu Lin, Feng-Feng Song, Guang-Ming Zhang&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We develop a Ginzburg-Landau theory for commensurate pair density wave (PDW) states in a hexagonal lattice system, relevant to the kagome superconductors $\rm{AV_3Sb_5}$. Compared to previous theoretical frameworks, the commensurate wave vectors permit additional symmetric terms in the free energy, altering the system's ground state and its degeneracy. In particular, we analyze topological defects in the energetically favorable $\psi_{\text{kagome}}$ ground state and find that kinks on domain walls can carry $1/3$ topological charges. We further establish a correspondence between the SC fluctuations in these states and an effective $J_1-J_2$ frustrated XY model on the emergent kagome lattice. By employing a state-of-the-art numerical tensor network method, we rigorously solve this effective model at finite temperatures and confirm the existence of a vestigial phase characterized by $1/3$ vortex-antivortex pairs in low temperatures with the absence of phase coherence of Cooper pairs, which is dual to the charge-$6e$ condensed phase. Our theory provides a potential explanation for the vestigial charge-$6e$ magnetoresistance oscillations observed in recent experiments [J. Ge, et. al., Phys. Rev. X 14, 021025 (2024)].&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11447'&gt;arXiv:2406.11447&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 17 Jun 2024 12:02:11 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Weakly first-order melting of the 1/3 plateau in the Shastry-Sutherland model</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10689</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Samuel Nyckees, Philippe Corboz, Frédéric Mila&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We investigate the thermal properties of the 1/3 plateau in the Shastry-Sutherland model with infinite projected entangled-pair states (iPEPS) by performing the imaginary time evolution of the infinite temperature density matrix. We show that both the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ and $\mathbb{Z}_3$ broken symmetries of the ground states are restored at a unique temperature where the correlation length has a peak, and that the melting of the plateau occurs via a single weakly first-order transition. We focus on the experimentally relevant coupling constants deep into the 1/3 plateau phase at $h = 1$ and $J'/J = 0.63$, which was estimated to describe the SrCu$_2$(BO$_3$)$_2$ compound. By computing the free energy we are able to locate the transition temperature around $T_c \simeq 4.8$K well above the temperature $T=2$K, at which the 1/3 plateau was observed in experiments. The investigation is supplemented by adding a bias term to the Hamiltonian and studying the induced crossover. We further map the transition line in the field-temperature phase diagram.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10689'&gt;arXiv:2406.10689&lt;/a&gt;] Published Sat, 15 Jun 2024 17:04:34 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Holographic Classical Shadow Tomography</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11788</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Shuhan Zhang, Xiaozhou Feng, Matteo Ippoliti, Yi-Zhuang You&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We introduce "holographic shadows", a new class of randomized measurement schemes for classical shadow tomography that achieves the optimal scaling of sample complexity for learning geometrically local Pauli operators at any length scale, without the need for fine-tuning protocol parameters such as circuit depth or measurement rate. Our approach utilizes hierarchical quantum circuits, such as tree quantum circuits or holographic random tensor networks. Measurements within the holographic bulk correspond to measurements at different scales on the boundary (i.e. the physical system of interests), facilitating efficient quantum state estimation across observable at all scales. Considering the task of estimating string-like Pauli observables supported on contiguous intervals of $k$ sites in a 1D system, our method achieves an optimal sample complexity scaling of $\sim d^k\mathrm{poly}(k)$, with $d$ the local Hilbert space dimension. We present a holographic minimal cut framework to demonstrate the universality of this sample complexity scaling and validate it with numerical simulations, illustrating the efficacy of holographic shadows in enhancing quantum state learning capabilities.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11788'&gt;arXiv:2406.11788&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 17 Jun 2024 17:40:59 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Solitons with irrational charge in a one-dimensional quantum ferroelectric</title>

Kivelson&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We use analytic (mean-field) and density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) methods to study a simplified one-dimensional version of the SSH-Holstein model of electron-phonon interactions with one electron per site (half filling) where, as a function of the ratio of the two couplings, three distinct insulating phases arise - a site-centered charge-density-wave (CDW), a bond-centered bond-density-wave (BDW), and an intermediate ferroelectric (inversion-symmetry breaking) phase with coexisting CDW and BDW order. In the intermediate phase our DMRG results establish the existence of point-like soliton excitations with irrational charge (that depends on a ratio of coupling constants) and either spin 1/2 or spin 0, and a surprisingly light effective mass.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11952'&gt;arXiv:2406.11952&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 17 Jun 2024 18:00:00 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Edge Spin fractionalization in one-dimensional spin-$S$ quantum antiferromagnets</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11955</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Pradip Kattel, Yicheng Tang, J. H. Pixley, Natan Andrei&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We show that a gapped spin-$S$ chain with antiferromagnetic (AFM) order exhibits in the thermodynamic limit exponentially localized fractional $\pm \frac{S}{2}$ edge modes when the system possesses U(1) symmetry. We show this for integrable and non integrable spin chains both analytically and numerically. Through exact analytical solutions, we show that an AFM spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ chain with {\it explicitly} broken $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry and an integrable AFM spin-$1$ chain with {\it spontaneously} broken $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry have $\pm \frac{1}{4}$ and $\pm \frac{1}{2}$ fractionalized edge modes, respectively. Furthermore, employing the density matrix renormalization group technique, we extend this analysis to {\it generic} $XXZ-S$ chains with $S\leq 3$ and demonstrate that these fractional spins are robust quantum observables, substantiated by the observation of a variance of the associated fractional spin operators that is consistent with a vanishing functional form in the thermodynamic limit. Moreover, we find that the edge modes are robust to disorder that couples to the Néel order parameter.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11955'&gt;arXiv:2406.11955&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 17 Jun 2024 18:00:01 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Constrained dynamics and confinement in the two-dimensional quantum Ising model</title>

In the ordered phase, the model is predicted to exhibit dynamically constrained dynamics, leading to confinement of elementary excitations and slow thermalization. After demonstrating the signatures of confinement, we probe the dynamics of interfaces in the constrained regime through sudden quenches of product states with domains of opposite magnetization. We find that the nature of excitations can be captured by perturbation theory throughout the confining regime, and identify the crossover to the deconfining regime. We systematically explore the effect of the transverse field on the modes propagating along flat interfaces and investigate the crossover from resonant to diffusive melting of a square of flipped spins embedded in a larger lattice.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11979'&gt;arXiv:2406.11979&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 17 Jun 2024 18:01:34 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Exploring Gamification in Quantum Computing: The Qubit Factory</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Glen Evenbly&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Gamification of quantum theory can provide new inroads into the subject: by allowing users to experience simulated worlds that manifest obvious quantum behaviors they can potentially build intuition for quantum phenomena. The Qubit Factory is an engineering-style puzzle game based on a gamified quantum circuit simulator that is designed to provide an introduction to qubits and quantum computing, while being approachable to those with no prior background in the area. It introduces an intuitive visual language for representing quantum states, gates and circuits, further enhanced by animations to aid in visualization. The Qubit Factory presents a hierarchy of increasingly difficult tasks for the user to solve, where each task requires the user to construct and run an appropriate classical/quantum circuit built from a small selection of components. Earlier tasks cover the fundamentals of qubits, quantum gates, superpositions and entanglement. Later tasks cover important quantum algorithms and protocols including superdense coding, quantum teleportation, entanglement distillation, classical and quantum error correction, state tomography, the Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm, quantum repeaters and more.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11995'&gt;arXiv:2406.11995&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 17 Jun 2024 18:08:53 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Equivalence Classes of Quantum Error-Correcting Codes</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Andrey Boris Khesin, Alexander Li&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Quantum error-correcting codes (QECC's) are needed to combat the inherent noise affecting quantum processes. Using ZX calculus, we represent QECC's in a form called a ZX diagram, consisting of a tensor network. In this paper, we present canonical forms for CSS codes and CSS states (which are CSS codes with 0 inputs), and we show the resulting canonical forms for the toric code and certain surface codes. Next, we introduce the notion of prime code diagrams, ZX diagrams of codes that have a single connected component with the property that no sequence of rewrite rules can split such a diagram into two connected components. We also show the Fundamental Theorem of Clifford Codes, proving the existence and uniqueness of the prime decomposition of Clifford codes. Next, we tabulate equivalence classes of ZX diagrams under a different definition of equivalence that allows output permutations and any local operations on the outputs. Possible representatives of these equivalence classes are analyzed. This work expands on previous works in exploring the canonical forms of QECC's in their ZX diagram representations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12083'&gt;arXiv:2406.12083&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 17 Jun 2024 20:48:43 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Efficient particle-conserving brick-wall quantum circuits</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12130</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Babatunde M. Ayeni&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; In variational quantum optimization with particle-conserving quantum circuits, it is often difficult to decide a priori which particle-conserving gates and circuit ansatzes would be most efficient for a given problem. This is important especially for noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) processors with limited resources. While this may be challenging to answer in general, deciding which particle-conserving gate would be most efficient is easier within a specified circuit ansatz. In this paper, we show how to construct efficient particle-conserving gates using some practical ideas from symmetric tensor networks. We derive different types of particle-conserving gates, including the generalized one. We numerically test the gates under the framework of brick-wall circuits. We show that the general particle-conserving gate with only four real parameters is generally best. In addition, we present an algorithm to extend brick-wall circuit with two-qubit nearest-neighbouring gates to non-nearest-neighbouring gates. We test and compare the efficiency of the circuits with Heisenberg spin chain with and without next-nearest-neighbouring interactions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12130'&gt;arXiv:2406.12130&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 17 Jun 2024 22:40:18 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>The Green's function Monte Carlo combined with projected entangled pair state approach to the frustrated $J_1$-$J_2$ Heisenberg model</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12207</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; He-Yu Lin, Yibin Guo, Rong-Qiang He, Z. Y. Xie, Zhong-Yi Lu&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The tensor network algorithm, a family of prevalent numerical methods for quantum many-body problems, aptly captures the entanglement properties intrinsic to quantum systems, enabling precise representation of quantum states. However, its computational cost is notably high, particularly in calculating physical observables like correlation functions. To surmount the computational challenge and enhance efficiency, we propose integrating the Green's function Monte Carlo (GFMC) method with the projected entangled pair state (PEPS) ansatz. This approach combines the high-efficiency characteristics of Monte Carlo with the sign-free nature of tensor network states and proves effective in addressing the computational bottleneck. To showcase its prowess, we apply this hybrid approach to investigate the antiferromagnetic $J_1$-$J_2$ Heisenberg model on the square lattice, a model notorious for its sign problem in quantum Monte Carlo simulations. Our results reveal a substantial improvement in the accuracy of ground-state energy when utilizing a preliminary PEPS as the guiding wave function for GFMC. By calculating the structure factor and spin-spin correlation functions, we further characterize the phase diagram, identifying a possible columnar valence-bond state phase within the intermediate parameter range of $0.52 &lt; J_2/J_1 &lt; 0.58$. This comprehensive study underscores the efficacy of our combined approach, demonstrating its ability to accurately simulate frustrated quantum spin systems while ensuring computational efficiency.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12207'&gt;arXiv:2406.12207&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 18 Jun 2024 02:08:28 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Cluster-projected matrix product state: framework for engineering exact quantum many-body ground states in one and two dimensions</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12357</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Hidehiro Saito, Chisa Hotta&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We propose a framework to design concurrently a frustration-free quantum many-body Hamiltonian and its numerically exact ground states on a sufficiently large finite-size cluster in one and two dimensions using an elementary matrix product state (MPS) representation. Our approach strategically chooses a local cluster Hamiltonian, which is arranged to overlap with neighboring clusters on a designed lattice. The frustration-free Hamiltonian is given as the sum of the cluster Hamiltonians by ensuring that there exists a state that has its local submanifolds as the lowest-energy eigenstate of every cluster. The key to find such a solution is a systematic protocol, which projects out excited states on every cluster using MPS and effectively entangles the cluster states. The protocol offers several advantages, including the ability to achieve exact many-body ground-state solutions at nearly equal cost in one and two dimensions, those belonging to gapless or long-range entangled classes of ground states, flexibility in designing Hamiltonians unbiasedly across various forms of models, and numerically feasible validation through energy calculations. Our protocol offers the exact ground state for general frustration-free Hamiltonian, and enables the exploration of exact phase boundaries and the analysis of even a spatially nonuniform random system, providing platforms for quantum simulations and benchmarks.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12357'&gt;arXiv:2406.12357&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 18 Jun 2024 07:41:36 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Entanglement swapping in critical quantum spin chains</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Masahiro Hoshino, Masaki Oshikawa, Yuto Ashida&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The transfer of quantum information between many-qubit states is a subject of fundamental importance in quantum science and technology. We consider entanglement swapping in critical quantum spin chains, where the entanglement between the two chains is induced solely by the Bell-state measurements. We employ a boundary conformal field theory (CFT) approach and describe the measurements as conformal boundary conditions in the replicated field theory. We show that the swapped entanglement exhibits a logarithmic scaling, whose coefficient takes a universal value determined by the scaling dimension of the boundary condition changing operator. We apply our framework to the critical spin-1/2 XXZ chain and determine the universal coefficient by the boundary CFT analysis. We also numerically verify these results by the tensor-network calculations. Possible experimental relevance to Rydberg atom arrays is briefly discussed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12377'&gt;arXiv:2406.12377&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 18 Jun 2024 08:04:58 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

We focus on low-entanglement variational manifolds and target Hamiltonians with classical ground states. Despite the presence of highly entangled intermediate states along the exact quantum annealing path, the variational evolution converges to the target ground state. We demonstrate this approach with several examples that align with our theoretical analysis.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12392'&gt;arXiv:2406.12392&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 18 Jun 2024 08:31:01 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Integrability of open boundary driven quantum circuits</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12695</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Chiara Paletta, Tomaž Prosen&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; In this paper, we address the problem of Yang-Baxter integrability of doubled quantum circuit of qubits (spins 1/2) with open boundary conditions where the two circuit replicas are only coupled at the left or right boundary. We investigate the cases where the bulk is given by elementary six vertex unitary gates of either the free fermionic XX type or interacting XXZ type. By using the Sklyanin's construction of reflection algebra, we obtain the most general solutions of the boundary Yang-Baxter equation for such a setup. We use this solution to build, from the transfer matrix formalism, integrable circuits with two step discrete time Floquet (aka brickwork) dynamics. We prove that, only if the bulk is a free-model, the boundary matrices are in general non-factorizable, and for particular choice of free parameters yield non-trivial unitary dynamics with boundary interaction between the two chains. Then, we consider the limit of continuous time evolution and we give the interpretation of a restricted set of the boundary terms in the Lindbladian setting. Specifically, for a particular choice of free parameters, the solutions correspond to an open quantum system dynamics with the source terms representing injecting or removing particles from the boundary of the spin chain.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12695'&gt;arXiv:2406.12695&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 18 Jun 2024 15:08:46 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>A Space Group Symmetry Informed Network for O(3) Equivariant Crystal Tensor Prediction</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12888</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Keqiang Yan, Alexandra Saxton, Xiaofeng Qian, Xiaoning Qian, Shuiwang Ji&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We consider the prediction of general tensor properties of crystalline materials, including dielectric, piezoelectric, and elastic tensors. A key challenge here is how to make the predictions satisfy the unique tensor equivariance to O(3) group and invariance to crystal space groups. To this end, we propose a General Materials Tensor Network (GMTNet), which is carefully designed to satisfy the required symmetries. To evaluate our method, we curate a dataset and establish evaluation metrics that are tailored to the intricacies of crystal tensor predictions. Experimental results show that our GMTNet not only achieves promising performance on crystal tensors of various orders but also generates predictions fully consistent with the intrinsic crystal symmetries. Our code is publicly available as part of the AIRS library (https://github.com/divelab/AIRS).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12888'&gt;arXiv:2406.12888&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 03 Jun 2024 16:26:16 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Tensor networks for non-invertible symmetries in 3+1d and beyond</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12978</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Pranay Gorantla, Shu-Heng Shao, Nathanan Tantivasadakarn&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Tensor networks provide a natural language for non-invertible symmetries in general Hamiltonian lattice models. We use ZX-diagrams, which are tensor network presentations of quantum circuits, to define a non-invertible operator implementing the Wegner duality in 3+1d lattice $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory. The non-invertible algebra, which mixes with lattice translations, can be efficiently computed using ZX-calculus. We further deform the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory while preserving the duality and find a model with nine exactly degenerate ground states on a torus, consistent with the Lieb-Schultz-Mattis-type constraint imposed by the symmetry. Finally, we provide a ZX-diagram presentation of the non-invertible duality operators (including non-invertible parity/reflection symmetries) of generalized Ising models based on graphs, encompassing the 1+1d Ising model, the three-spin Ising model, the Ashkin-Teller model, and the 2+1d plaquette Ising model. The mixing (or lack thereof) with spatial symmetries is understood from a unifying perspective based on graph theory.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12978'&gt;arXiv:2406.12978&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 18 Jun 2024 18:00:15 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Non-stabilizerness in kinetically-constrained Rydberg atom arrays</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Ryan Smith, Zlatko Papić, Andrew Hallam&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Non-stabilizer states are a fundamental resource for universal quantum computation. However,despite broad significance in quantum computing, the emergence of "many-body" non-stabilizerness in interacting quantum systems remains poorly understood due to its analytical intractability. Here we show that Rydberg atom arrays provide a natural reservoir of non-stabilizerness that extends beyond single qubits and arises from quantum correlations engendered by the Rydberg blockade. We demonstrate that this non-stabilizerness can be experimentally accessed in two complementary ways, either by performing quench dynamics or via adiabatic ground state preparation. Using the analytical framework based on matrix product states, we explain the origin of Rydberg nonstabilizerness via a quantum circuit decomposition of the wave function.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14348'&gt;arXiv:2406.14348&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 20 Jun 2024 14:17:34 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Thermally activated detection of dark particles in a weakly coupled quantum Ising ladder</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15024</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Yunjing Gao, Jiahao Yang, Huihang Lin, Rong Yu, Jianda Wu&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The Ising$_h^2$ integrable field theory emerges when two quantum critical Ising chains are weakly coupled. This theory possesses eight types of relativistic particles, among which the lightest one ($B_1$) has been predicted to be a dark particle, which cannot be excited from the ground state through (quasi-)local operations. The stability on one hand highlights its potential for applications, and on the other hand makes it challenging to be observed. Here, we point out that the mass of the $B_1$ dark particle $m_{B_1}$ appears as a thermally activated gap extracted from local spin dynamical structure factor at low frequency ($\omega \ll m_{B_1}$) and low temperatures ($T \ll m_{B_1}$). We then further propose that this gapped behavior can be directly detected via the NMR relaxation rate measurement in a proper experimental setup. Our results provide a practical criterion for verifying the existence of dark particles.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15024'&gt;arXiv:2406.15024&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 21 Jun 2024 09:58:23 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Chiral Spin Liquid and Quantum Phase Transition in the Triangular Lattice Hofstadter-Hubbard Model</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15348</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Stefan Divic, Tomohiro Soejima, Valentin Crépel, Michael P. Zaletel, Andrew Millis&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Recent advancements in moiré engineering motivate study of the behavior of strongly-correlated electrons subject to substantial orbital magnetic flux. We investigate the triangular lattice Hofstadter-Hubbard model at one-quarter flux quantum per plaquette and a density of one electron per site, where geometric frustration has been argued to stabilize a chiral spin liquid phase intermediate between the weak-coupling integer quantum Hall and strong-coupling 120deg antiferromagnetic phases. In this work, we use Density Matrix Renormalization Group methods and analytical arguments to analyze the compactification of the Hofstadter-Hubbard model to cylinders of finite radius. We introduce a glide particle-hole symmetry operation which for odd-circumference cylinders, we show, is spontaneously broken at the quantum Hall to spin liquid transition. We further demonstrate that the transition is associated with a diverging correlation length of a charge-neutral operator. For even-circumference cylinders the transition is associated with a dramatic quantitative enhancement in the correlation length upon threading external magnetic flux. Altogether, we argue that the 2+1D CSL-IQH transition is in fact continuous and features critical correlations of the charge density and other spin rotationally-invariant observables.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15348'&gt;arXiv:2406.15348&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 21 Jun 2024 17:58:25 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Observation of a non-Hermitian supersonic mode on a trapped-ion quantum computer</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15557</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Yuxuan Zhang, Juan Carrasquilla, Yong Baek Kim&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Quantum computers have long been anticipated to excel in simulating quantum many-body physics. While most previous work has focused on Hermitian physics, we demonstrate the power of variational quantum circuits for resource-efficient simulations of dynamical and equilibrium physics in non-Hermitian systems, revealing new phenomena beyond standard Hermitian quantum machines. Using a variational quantum compilation scheme for fermionic systems, we reduce gate count, save qubits, and eliminate the need for postselection, a major challenge in simulating non-Hermitian dynamics via standard Trotterization. Experimentally, we observed a supersonic mode in the connected density-density correlation function on an $ n = 18 $ fermionic chain after a non-Hermitian, locally interacting quench, which would otherwise be forbidden by the Lieb-Robinson bound in a Hermitian system. Additionally, we investigate sequential quantum circuits generated by tensor networks for ground state preparation, here defined as the eigenstate with the lowest real part eigenvalue, using a variance minimization scheme. Through a trapped-ion implementation on the Quantinuum H1 quantum processor, we accurately capture correlation functions and energies across an exceptional point on a dissipative spin chain up to length $ n = 20 $ using only 3 qubits. Motivated by these advancements, we provide an analytical example demonstrating that simulating single-qubit non-Hermitian dynamics for $\Theta(\log(n))$ time from certain initial states is exponentially hard on a quantum computer, offering insights into the opportunities and limitations of using quantum computation for simulating non-Hermitian physics.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15557'&gt;arXiv:2406.15557&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 21 Jun 2024 18:00:06 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

Reichman&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We investigate the application of matrix product state (MPS) representations of the influence functionals (IF) for the calculation of real-time equilibrium correlation functions in open quantum systems. Focusing specifically on the unbiased spin-boson model, we explore the use of IF-MPSs for complex time propagation, as well as IF-MPSs for constructing correlation functions in the steady state. We examine three different IF approaches: one based on the Kadanoff-Baym contour targeting correlation functions at all times, one based on a complex contour targeting the correlation function at a single time, and a steady state formulation which avoids imaginary or complex times, while providing access to correlation functions at all times. We show that within the IF language, the steady state formulation provides a powerful approach to evaluate equilibrium correlation functions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15737'&gt;arXiv:2406.15737&lt;/a&gt;] Published Sat, 22 Jun 2024 05:06:43 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

We present high-quality data collapses for the order parameter and for the entanglement entropy for three minimal models: transverse-field Ising, 3-state Potts and Ashkin-Teller. Furthermore, we show that scan-DMRG successfully captures the universal critical scaling when applied across the magnetic Wess-Zumino-Witten and non-magnetic Ising transitions in the frustrated Haldane chain. In addition, we report a universal scaling of the lowest excitation energy as a function of a gradient rate. Finally, we argue that the scan-DMRG approach has significantly lower computational cost compare to the conventional DMRG protocols to study quantum phase transitions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16594'&gt;arXiv:2406.16594&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 24 Jun 2024 12:34:40 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>OQuPy: A Python package to efficiently simulate non-Markovian open quantum systems with process tensors</title>

Eastham, Dominic Gribben, Jonathan Keeling, Dainius Kilda, Peter Kirton, Ewen D. C. Lawrence, Brendon W. Lovett, Eoin O'Neill, Aidan Strathearn, Roosmarijn de Wit&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Non-Markovian dynamics arising from the strong coupling of a system to a structured environment is essential in many applications of quantum mechanics and emerging technologies. Deriving an accurate description of general quantum dynamics including memory effects is however a demanding task, prohibitive to standard analytical or direct numerical approaches. We present a major release of our open source software package, OQuPy (Open Quantum System in Python), which provides several recently developed numerical methods that address this challenging task. It utilizes the process tensor approach to open quantum systems in which a single map, the process tensor, captures all possible effects of an environment on the system. The representation of the process tensor in a tensor network form allows an exact yet highly efficient description of non-Markovian open quantum systems (NM-OQS). The OQuPy package provides methods to (1) compute the dynamics and multi-time correlations of quantum systems coupled to single and multiple environments, (2) optimize control protocols for NM-OQS, (3) simulate interacting chains of NM-OQS, and (4) compute the mean-field dynamics of an ensemble of NM-OQS coupled to a common central system. Our aim is to provide an easily accessible and extensible tool for researchers of open quantum systems in fields such as quantum chemistry, quantum sensing, and quantum information.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16650'&gt;arXiv:2406.16650&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 24 Jun 2024 13:59:34 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

We demonstrate the usefulness of this technique by computing the average plaquette at zero temperature and the Polyakov loop susceptibility at finite temperatures for 2+1D SU(2) and SU(3) gauge theories. The deconfinement transition is identified for both gauge groups, with the SU(2) case being consistent with previous Monte Carlo results.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16763'&gt;arXiv:2406.16763&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 24 Jun 2024 16:21:02 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>A CFT dual for evaporating black holes: boundary continuous matrix product states</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Niloofar Vardian&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Tensor network states, especially Matrix Product States (MPS), are crucial tools for studying how particles in large quantum systems are entangled with each other. MPS are particularly effective for modeling systems in one-dimensional space. Their continuous version, known as continuous Matrix Product States (cMPS), extends this approach to more complex quantum field theories that describe systems with an infinite number of interacting particles. This paper introduces a novel extension, boundary continuous Matrix Product States (BCMPS), which incorporate boundary states from conformal field theory (CFT). We construct BCMPS and explore their potential holographic duals, linking them to black hole microstates with end-of-the-world branes in AdS/CFT. This connection hints at a deeper relationship between tensor networks and spacetime geometry, potentially offering new insights into the interplay between quantum information and gravity.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17021'&gt;arXiv:2406.17021&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 24 Jun 2024 18:00:03 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Density matrix renormalization group study of quantum-geometry-facilitated pair density wave order</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17187</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Hao-Xin Wang, Wen Huang&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Understanding the formation of novel pair density waves (PDWs) in strongly correlated electronic systems remains challenging. Recent mean-field studies suggest that PDW phases may arise in strong-coupling multiband superconductors by virtue of the quantum geometric properties of paired electrons. However, scrutiny through sophisticated many-body calculations has been lacking. Employing large-scale density matrix renormalization group calculations, we obtain in the strong-coupling regime the phase diagram as a function of doping concentration and a tuning interaction parameter for a simple two-orbital model that incorporates quantum geometric effects. The phase diagram reveals a robust PDW phase spanning a broad range of parameters, characterized by a Luttinger parameter $K_{sc} \sim 0.3$ and the absence of coexisting competing spin or charge density wave orders. The observed pairing field configuration aligns with the phenomenological understanding that quantum geometry can promote PDW formation. Our study provides the most compelling numerical evidence to date for quantum-geometry-facilitated intrinsic PDW order in strongly correlated systems, paving the way for further exploration of novel PDW orders and quantum geometric effects in such systems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17187'&gt;arXiv:2406.17187&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 25 Jun 2024 00:01:58 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

Leveraging the robust support of MindSpore, an advanced open-source deep learning training/inference framework, MindSpore Quantum exhibits exceptional efficiency in the design and training of variational quantum algorithms on both CPU and GPU platforms, delivering remarkable performance. Furthermore, this framework places a strong emphasis on enhancing the operational efficiency of quantum algorithms when executed on real quantum hardware. This encompasses the development of algorithms for quantum circuit compilation and qubit mapping, crucial components for achieving optimal performance on quantum processors. In addition to the core framework, we introduce QuPack, a meticulously crafted quantum computing acceleration engine. QuPack significantly accelerates the simulation speed of MindSpore Quantum, particularly in variational quantum eigensolver (VQE), quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA), and tensor network simulations, providing astonishing speed. This combination of cutting-edge technologies empowers researchers and practitioners to explore the frontiers of quantum computing with unprecedented efficiency and performance.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17248'&gt;arXiv:2406.17248&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 25 Jun 2024 03:28:40 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Plaquette-type valence bond solid state in the $J_1$-$J_2$ square-lattice Heisenberg model</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17417</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Jiale Huang, Xiangjian Qian, Mingpu Qin&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We utilize Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) and Fully Augmented Matrix Product States (FAMPS) methods to investigate the Valence Bond Solid (VBS) phase in the $J_1$-$J_2$ square lattice Heisenberg model. To differentiate between the Columnar Valence Bond Solid (CVBS) and Plaquette Valence Bond Solid (PVBS) phases, we introduce an anisotropy $\Delta_y$ in the nearest neighboring coupling in the $y$-direction, aiming at detecting the possible spontaneous rotational symmetry breaking in the VBS phase. In the calculations, we push the bond dimension to as large as $D = 25000$ in FAMPS, simulating systems at a maximum size of $14 \times 14$. With a careful extrapolation of the truncation errors and appropriate finite-size scaling, followed by finite $\Delta_y$ scaling analysis of the VBS dimer order parameters, we identify the VBS phase as a PVBS type, meaning there is no spontaneous rotational symmetry breaking in the VBS phase. This study not only resolves the long-standing issue of the characterization of the VBS order in the $J_1$-$J_2$ square lattice Heisenberg model but also highlights the capabilities of FAMPS in the study of two-dimensional quantum many-body systems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17417'&gt;arXiv:2406.17417&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 25 Jun 2024 09:39:28 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>A Matrix Product State Model for Simultaneous Classification and Generation</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17441</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Alex Mossi, Bojan Žunkovic, Kyriakos Flouris&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Quantum machine learning (QML) is a rapidly expanding field that merges the principles of quantum computing with the techniques of machine learning. One of the powerful mathematical frameworks in this domain is tensor networks. These networks are used to approximate high-order tensors by contracting tensors with lower ranks. Initially developed for simulating quantum systems, tensor networks have become integral to quantum computing and, by extension, to QML. Drawing inspiration from these quantum methods, specifically the Matrix Product States (MPS), we apply them in a classical machine learning setting. Their ability to efficiently represent and manipulate complex, high-dimensional data makes them effective in a supervised learning framework. Here, we present an MPS model, in which the MPS functions as both a classifier and a generator. The dual functionality of this novel MPS model permits a strategy that enhances the traditional training of supervised MPS models. This framework is inspired by generative adversarial networks and is geared towards generating more realistic samples by reducing outliers. In addition, our contributions offer insights into the mechanics of tensor network methods for generation tasks. Specifically, we discuss alternative embedding functions and a new sampling method from non-normalized MPSs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17441'&gt;arXiv:2406.17441&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 25 Jun 2024 10:23:36 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Exact results on the dynamics of the stochastic Floquet-East model</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Cecilia De Fazio, Juan P. Garrahan, Katja Klobas&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We introduce a stochastic generalisation of the classical deterministic Floquet-East model, a discrete circuit with the same kinetic constraint as the East model of glasses. We prove exactly that, in the limit of long time and large size, this model has a large deviation phase transition between active and inactive dynamical phases. We also compute the finite time and size scaling of general space-time fluctuations, which for the case of inactive regions gives rise to dynamical hydrophobicity. We also discuss how, through the Trotter limit, these exact results also hold for the continuous-time East model, thus proving long-standing observations in kinetically constrained models. Our results here illustrate the applicability of exact tensor network methods for solving problems in many-body stochastic systems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17464'&gt;arXiv:2406.17464&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 25 Jun 2024 11:08:20 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Unifying methods for optimal control in non-Markovian quantum systems via process tensors</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Carlos Ortega-Taberner, Eoin O'Neill, Eoin Butler, Gerald E. Fux, P. R. Eastham&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The large dimensionality of environments is the limiting factor in applying optimal control to open quantum systems beyond Markovian approximations. Multiple methods exist to simulate non-Markovian open systems which effectively reduce the environment to a number of active degrees of freedom. Here we show that several of these methods can be expressed in terms of a process tensor in the form of a matrix-product-operator, which serves as a unifying framework to show how they can be used in optimal control, and to compare their performance. The matrix-product-operator form provides a general scheme for computing gradients using back propagation, and allows the efficiency of the different methods to be compared via the bond dimensions of their respective process tensors.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17719'&gt;arXiv:2406.17719&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 25 Jun 2024 17:09:41 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

We observe a continuum of scattering, which is reproduced by matrix product simulations, and no phase transition is detected in any bulk measurements. Comparison to heat capacity simulations suggest the material is within the Heisenberg spin liquid phase. AC Susceptibility shows a significant 23~mK downturn, indicating a gap in the magnetic spectrum. The combination of a gap with no detectable magnetic order, comparison to theoretical models, and comparison to other $A$YbSe$_2$ compounds all strongly indicate NaYbSe$_2$ is within the quantum spin liquid phase. The gap also allows us to rule out a gapless Dirac spin liquid, with a gapped $\mathbb{Z}_2$ liquid the most natural explanation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17773'&gt;arXiv:2406.17773&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 25 Jun 2024 17:58:47 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Quantum-Inspired Fluid Simulation of 2D Turbulence with GPU Acceleration</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17823</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Leonhard Hölscher, Pooja Rao, Lukas Müller, Johannes Klepsch, Andre Luckow, Tobias Stollenwerk, Frank K. Wilhelm&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Tensor network algorithms can efficiently simulate complex quantum many-body systems by utilizing knowledge of their structure and entanglement. These methodologies have been adapted recently for solving the Navier-Stokes equations, which describe a spectrum of fluid phenomena, from the aerodynamics of vehicles to weather patterns. Within this quantum-inspired paradigm, velocity is encoded as matrix product states (MPS), effectively harnessing the analogy between interscale correlations of fluid dynamics and entanglement in quantum many-body physics. This particular tensor structure is also called quantics tensor train (QTT). By utilizing NVIDIA's cuQuantum library to perform parallel tensor computations on GPUs, our adaptation speeds up simulations by up to 12.1 times. This allows us to study the algorithm in terms of its applicability, scalability, and performance. By simulating two qualitatively different but commonly encountered 2D flow problems at high Reynolds numbers up to $1\times10^7$ using a fourth-order time stepping scheme, we find that the algorithm has a potential advantage over direct numerical simulations in the turbulent regime as the requirements for grid resolution increase drastically. In addition, we derive the scaling $\chi=\mathcal{O}(\text{poly}(1/\epsilon))$ for the maximum bond dimension $\chi$ of MPS representing turbulent flow fields, with an error $\epsilon$, based on the spectral distribution of turbulent kinetic energy. Our findings motivate further exploration of related quantum algorithms and other tensor network methods.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17823'&gt;arXiv:2406.17823&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 25 Jun 2024 10:31:20 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Computing linear optical spectra in the presence of nonadiabatic effects on Graphics Processing Units using molecular dynamics and tensor-network approaches</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17994</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Evan Lambertson, Dayana Bashirova, Kye E. Hunter, Benhardt Hansen, Tim J. Zuehlsdorff&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We compare two recently developed strategies, implemented in open source software packages, for computing linear optical spectra in condensed phase environments in the presence of nonadiabatic effects. Both approaches rely on computing excitation energy and transition dipole fluctuations along molecular dynamics (MD) trajectories, treating molecular and environmental degrees of freedom on the same footing. Spectra are then generated in two ways: In the recently developed Gaussian Non-Condon Theory (GNCT), the linear response functions are computed in terms of independent adiabatic excited states, with non-Condon effects described through spectral densities of transition dipole fluctuations. For strongly coupled excited states, we instead parameterize a linear vibronic coupling (LVC) Hamiltonian directly from spectral densities of energy fluctuations and diabatic couplings computed along the MD trajectory. The optical spectrum is then calculated using powerful, numerically exact tensor-network approaches. Both the electronic structure calculations to sample system fluctuations and the quantum dynamics simulations using tensor-network methods are carried out on graphics processing units (GPUs), enabling rapid calculations on complex condensed phase systems. We assess the performance of the approaches using model systems in the presence of a conical intersection (CI), and the pyrazine molecule in different solvent environments.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17994'&gt;arXiv:2406.17994&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 26 Jun 2024 00:44:51 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>AdaZeta: Adaptive Zeroth-Order Tensor-Train Adaption for Memory-Efficient Large Language Models Fine-Tuning</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18060</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Yifan Yang, Kai Zhen, Ershad Banijamal, Athanasios Mouchtaris, Zheng Zhang&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) has achieved remarkable performance across various natural language processing tasks, yet it demands more and more memory as model sizes keep growing. To address this issue, the recently proposed Memory-efficient Zeroth-order (MeZO) methods attempt to fine-tune LLMs using only forward passes, thereby avoiding the need for a backpropagation graph. However, significant performance drops and a high risk of divergence have limited their widespread adoption. In this paper, we propose the Adaptive Zeroth-order Tensor-Train Adaption (AdaZeta) framework, specifically designed to improve the performance and convergence of the ZO methods. To enhance dimension-dependent ZO estimation accuracy, we introduce a fast-forward, low-parameter tensorized adapter. To tackle the frequently observed divergence issue in large-scale ZO fine-tuning tasks, we propose an adaptive query number schedule that guarantees convergence. Detailed theoretical analysis and extensive experimental results on Roberta-Large and Llama-2-7B models substantiate the efficacy of our AdaZeta framework in terms of accuracy, memory efficiency, and convergence speed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18060'&gt;arXiv:2406.18060&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 26 Jun 2024 04:33:13 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Probing a Modified Luttinger Sum Rule in the Strongly Interacting 1D Fermi-Hubbard Model</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18216</link>

This phenomenon remains subject of debate and is at the heart of an ongoing discussion about the nature of the metallic state in the pseudogap regime. Here we study a minimal model of a $k_F$ changing crossover in the one-dimensional Fermi-Hubbard model, where a tuning of the onsite interaction leads to a crossover between a spin-$1/2$ Luttinger liquid with small Fermi momentum and a spinless chargon liquid with large Fermi momentum. We attribute this to an emergent $U(1)$ symmetry in the strongly correlated limit, which can be used to derive a modified Luttinger sum rule recovering the large Fermi momentum. We analyse Friedel oscillations at the edge of a system to directly probe the change of Fermi momentum at zero and non-zero temperature. This paves the way for a direct experimental observation of changes of the Fermi momentum using ultracold fermions in a quantum gas microscope, with possible extensions to higher dimensional systems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18216'&gt;arXiv:2406.18216&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 26 Jun 2024 09:58:29 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Scalable tomography of many-body quantum environments with low temporal entanglement</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18458</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Ilia A. Luchnikov, Michael Sonner, Dmitry A. Abanin&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Describing dynamics of a quantum system coupled to a complex many-body environment is a ubiquitous problem in quantum science. General non-Markovian environments are characterized by their influence matrix~(IM) -- a multi-time tensor arising from repeated interactions between the system and environment. While complexity of the most generic IM grows exponentially with the evolution time, recent works argued that for many instances of physical many-body environments, the IM is significantly less complex. This is thanks to area-law scaling of temporal entanglement, which quantifies the correlations between the past and the future states of the system. However, efficient classical algorithms for computing IM are only available for non-interacting environments or certain interacting 1D environments. Here, we study a learning algorithm for reconstructing IMs of large many-body environments simulated on a quantum processor. This hybrid algorithm involves experimentally collecting quantum measurement results of auxiliary qubits which are repeatedly coupled to the many-body environment, followed by a classical machine-learning construction of a matrix-product (MPS) representation of the IM. Using the example of 1D spin-chain environments, with a classically generated training dataset, we demonstrate that the algorithm allows scalable reconstruction of IMs for long evolution times. The reconstructed IM can be used to efficiently model quantum transport through an impurity, including cases with multiple leads and time-dependent controls. These results indicate the feasibility of characterizing long-time dynamics of complex environments using a limited number of measurements, under the assumption of a moderate temporal entanglement.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18458'&gt;arXiv:2406.18458&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 26 Jun 2024 16:08:45 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

Recent progress in classical algorithms, especially those based on tensor network methods, has significantly reduced the classical simulation time and challenged the claim of the first-generation quantum advantage experiments. However, in terms of generating uncorrelated samples, time-to-solution, and energy consumption, previous classical simulation experiments still underperform the \textit{Sycamore} processor. Here we report an energy-efficient classical simulation algorithm, using 1432 GPUs to simulate quantum random circuit sampling which generates uncorrelated samples with higher linear cross entropy score and is 7 times faster than \textit{Sycamore} 53 qubits experiment. We propose a post-processing algorithm to reduce the overall complexity, and integrated state-of-the-art high-performance general-purpose GPU to achieve two orders of lower energy consumption compared to previous works. Our work provides the first unambiguous experimental evidence to refute \textit{Sycamore}'s claim of quantum advantage, and redefines the boundary of quantum computational advantage using random circuit sampling.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18889'&gt;arXiv:2406.18889&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 27 Jun 2024 05:01:47 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Exact Fisher zeros and thermofield dynamics across a quantum critical point</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18981</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Yang Liu, Songtai Lv, Yuchen Meng, Zefan Tan, Erhai Zhao, Haiyuan Zou&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; By setting the inverse temperature $\beta$ loose to occupy the complex plane, Fisher showed that the zeros of the complex partition function $Z$, if approaching the real $\beta$ axis, reveal a thermodynamic phase transition. More recently, Fisher zeros were used to mark the dynamical phase transition in quench dynamics. It remains unclear, however, how Fisher zeros can be employed to better understand quantum phase transitions or the non-unitary dynamics of open quantum systems. Here we answer this question by a comprehensive analysis of the analytically continued one-dimensional transverse field Ising model. We exhaust all the Fisher zeros to show that in the thermodynamic limit they congregate into a remarkably simple pattern in the form of continuous open or closed lines. These Fisher lines evolve smoothly as the coupling constant is tuned, and a qualitative change identifies the quantum critical point. By exploiting the connection between $Z$ and the thermofield double states, we obtain analytical expressions for the short- and long-time dynamics of the survival amplitude, including its scaling behavior at the quantum critical point. We point out $Z$ can be realized and probed in monitored quantum circuits. The exact analytical results are corroborated by the numerical tensor renormalization group. We further show that similar patterns of Fisher zeros also emerge in other spin models. Therefore, the approach outlined may serve as a powerful tool for interacting quantum systems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18981'&gt;arXiv:2406.18981&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 27 Jun 2024 08:22:43 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Wei-You Liao, Xiang Wang, Xiao-Yue Xu, Chen Ding, Shuo Zhang, He-Liang Huang, Chu Guo&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We introduce JuliVQC: a light-weight, yet extremely efficient variational quantum circuit simulator. JuliVQC is part of an effort for classical simulation of the \textit{Zuchongzhi} quantum processors, where it is extensively used to characterize the circuit noises, as a building block in the Schr$\ddot{\text{o}}$dinger-Feynman algorithm for classical verification and performance benchmarking, and for variational optimization of the Fsim gate parameters. The design principle of JuliVQC is three-fold: (1) Transparent implementation of its core algorithms, realized by using the high-performance script language Julia; (2) Efficiency is the focus, with a cache-friendly implementation of each elementary operations and support for shared-memory parallelization; (3) Native support of automatic differentiation for both the noiseless and noisy quantum circuits. We perform extensive numerical experiments on JuliVQC in different application scenarios, including quantum circuits, variational quantum circuits and their noisy counterparts, which show that its performance is among the top of the popular alternatives.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19212'&gt;arXiv:2406.19212&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 27 Jun 2024 14:36:34 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Refined Phase Diagram for a Spin-1 System Exhibiting a Haldane Phase</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Mohamad Mousa, Birgit Wehefritz-Kaufmann, Sabre Kais, Shawn Cui, Ralph Kaufmann&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We provide the phase diagram of a 2-parameter spin-1 chain that has a symmetry-protected topological (SPT) Haldane phase using computational algorithms along with tensor-network tools. We improve previous results, showing the existence of a new phase and new triple points. New striking features are the triple end of the Haldane phase and the complexity of phases bordering the Haldane phase in proximity allowing moving to nearby non-SPT phases via small perturbations. These characteristics make the system, which appears in Rydberg excitons, e.g. in Cu$_2$O, a prime candidate for applications.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19372'&gt;arXiv:2406.19372&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 27 Jun 2024 17:51:23 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Magic phase transition and non-local complexity in generalized $W$ State</title>

Giampaolo&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We employ the Stabilizer Renyi Entropy (SRE) to characterize a quantum phase transition that has so far eluded any standard description and can thus now be explained in terms of the interplay between its non-stabilizer properties and entanglement. The transition under consideration separates a region with a unique ground state from one with a degenerate ground state manifold spanned by states with finite and opposite (intensive) momenta. We show that SRE has a jump at the crossing points, while the entanglement entropy remains continuous. Moreover, by leveraging on a Clifford circuit mapping, we connect the observed jump in SRE to that occurring between standard and generalized $W$-states with finite momenta. This mapping allows us to quantify the SRE discontinuity analytically.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19457'&gt;arXiv:2406.19457&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 27 Jun 2024 18:00:06 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Interplay between local and non-local frustration in the 1D ANNNI chain I -- The even case</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19449</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Gianpaolo Torre, Alberto Giuseppe Catalano, Sven Benjamin Kožić, Fabio Franchini, Salvatore Marco Giampaolo&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We consider the effects of the competition between different sources of frustration in 1D spin chains through the analysis of the paradigmatic ANNNI model, which possesses an extensive amount of frustration of local origin due to the competition between nearest and next-to-nearest neighbor interactions. An additional, non-extensive amount of topological frustration can be added by applying suitable boundary conditions, and we show that this seemingly subdominant contribution significantly affects the model. Choosing periodic boundary conditions with an {\it even} number of sites not divisible by 4 and using the entanglement entropy as a probe, we demonstrate that in one of the model's phases, the ground state can be characterized as hosting two (almost) independent excitations. Thus, not only do we show an intriguing interplay between different types of frustration, but also manage to propose a non-trivial quasi-particle interpretation for it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19449'&gt;arXiv:2406.19449&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 27 Jun 2024 18:00:02 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>High-order Adaptive Rank Integrators for Multi-scale Linear Kinetic Transport Equations in the Hierarchical Tucker Format</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19479</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; William A. Sands, Wei Guo, Jing-Mei Qiu, Tao Xiong&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; In this paper, we present a new adaptive rank approximation technique for computing solutions to the high-dimensional linear kinetic transport equation. The approach we propose is based on a macro-micro decomposition of the kinetic model in which the angular domain is discretized with a tensor product quadrature rule under the discrete ordinates method. To address the challenges associated with the curse of dimensionality, the proposed low-rank method is cast in the framework of the hierarchical Tucker decomposition. The adaptive rank integrators we propose are built upon high-order discretizations for both time and space. In particular, this work considers implicit-explicit discretizations for time and finite-difference weighted-essentially non-oscillatory discretizations for space. The high-order singular value decomposition is used to perform low-rank truncation of the high-dimensional time-dependent distribution function. The methods are applied to several benchmark problems, where we compare the solution quality and measure compression achieved by the adaptive rank methods against their corresponding full-grid methods. We also demonstrate the benefits of high-order discretizations in the proposed low-rank framework.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19479'&gt;arXiv:2406.19479&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 27 Jun 2024 18:44:47 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>One-dimensional $Z_2$ lattice gauge theory in periodic Gauss-law sectors</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Vaibhav Sharma, Erich J Mueller&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We calculate the properties of a one-dimensional $Z_2$ lattice gauge theory in different Gauss law sectors, corresponding to different configurations of static charges set by the orientations of the gauge spins. Importantly, in quantum simulator experiments these sectors can be accessed without adding any additional physical particles or changing the Hamiltonian: The Gauss law sectors are simply set by the initial conditions. We study the interplay between conservation laws and interactions when the static charges are chosen to form periodic patterns. We classify the different Gauss law sectors and use the density matrix renormalization group to calculate the ground state compressibility, density profiles, charge density wave order parameters, and single particle correlation functions as a function of matter density. We find confined and deconfined phases, charge density waves, correlated insulators, and supersolids.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19565'&gt;arXiv:2406.19565&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 27 Jun 2024 22:49:59 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Efficient Tensor Network Algorithms for Spin Foam Models</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19676</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Seth K. Asante, Sebastian Steinhaus&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Numerical computations and methods have become increasingly crucial in the study of spin foam models across various regimes. This paper adds to this field by introducing new algorithms based on tensor network methods for computing amplitudes, focusing on topological SU(2) BF and Lorentzian EPRL spin foam models. By reorganizing the sums and tensors involved, vertex amplitudes are recast as a sequence of matrix contractions. This reorganization significantly reduces computational complexity and memory usage, allowing for scalable and efficient computations of the amplitudes for larger representation labels on standard consumer hardware--previously infeasible due to the computational demands of high-valent tensors. We apply these tensor network algorithms to analyze the characteristics of various vertex configurations, including Regge and vector geometries for the SU(2) BF theory, demonstrating consistent scaling behavior and differing oscillation patterns. Our benchmarks reveal substantial improvements in computational time and memory allocations, especially for large representation labels. Additionally, these tensor network methods are applicable to generic 2-complexes with multiple vertices, where we introduce partial-coherent vertex amplitudes to streamline the computations. The implementation of these algorithms is available on GitHub for further exploration and use.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19676'&gt;arXiv:2406.19676&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 28 Jun 2024 06:28:52 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>$\mathbb{Z}_4$ transitions in quantum loop models on a zig-zag ladder</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Bowy M. La Rivière, Natalia Chepiga&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We study the nature of quantum phase transitions out of $\mathbb{Z}_4$ ordered phases in quantum loop models on a zig-zag ladder. We report very rich critical behavior that includes a pair of Ising transitions, a multi-critical Ashkin-Teller point and a remarkably extended interval of a chiral transition. Although plaquette states turn out to be essential to realize chiral transitions, we demonstrate that critical regimes can be manipulated by deforming the model as to increase the presence of leg-dimerized states. This can be done to the point where the chiral transition turns into first order, we argue that this is associated with the emergence of a critical end point.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.20093'&gt;arXiv:2406.20093&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 28 Jun 2024 17:57:33 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Efficient state preparation for the quantum simulation of molecules in first quantization</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00249</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; William J. Huggins, Oskar Leimkuhler, Torin F. Stetina, K. Birgitta Whaley&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The quantum simulation of real molecules and materials is one of the most highly anticipated applications of quantum computing. Algorithms for simulating electronic structure using a first-quantized plane wave representation are especially promising due to their asymptotic efficiency. However, previous proposals for preparing initial states for these simulation algorithms scale poorly with the size of the basis set. We address this shortcoming by showing how to efficiently map states defined in a Gaussian type orbital basis to a plane wave basis with a scaling that is logarithmic in the number of plane waves. Our key technical result is a proof that molecular orbitals constructed from Gaussian type basis functions can be compactly represented in a plane wave basis using matrix product states. While we expect that other approaches could achieve the same logarithmic scaling with respect to basis set size, our proposed state preparation technique is also highly efficient in practice. For example, in a series of numerical experiments on small molecules, we find that our approach allows us to prepare an approximation to the Hartree-Fock state using orders of magnitude fewer non-Clifford gates than a naive approach. By resolving the issue of state preparation, our work allows for the first quantum simulation of molecular systems whose end-to-end complexity is truly sublinear in the basis set size.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00249'&gt;arXiv:2407.00249&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 28 Jun 2024 22:46:01 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Achieving Energetic Superiority Through System-Level Quantum Circuit Simulation</title>

Despite recent advances in classical algorithms aimed at refuting the milestone claim of Google's sycamore, challenges remain in generating uncorrelated samples of random quantum circuits. In this paper, we present a groundbreaking large-scale system technology that leverages optimization on global, node, and device levels to achieve unprecedented scalability for tensor networks. This enables the handling of large-scale tensor networks with memory capacities reaching tens of terabytes, surpassing memory space constraints on a single node. Our techniques enable accommodating large-scale tensor networks with up to tens of terabytes of memory, reaching up to 2304 GPUs with a peak computing power of 561 PFLOPS half-precision. Notably, we have achieved a time-to-solution of 14.22 seconds with energy consumption of 2.39 kWh which achieved fidelity of 0.002 and our most remarkable result is a time-to-solution of 17.18 seconds, with energy consumption of only 0.29 kWh which achieved a XEB of 0.002 after post-processing, outperforming Google's quantum processor Sycamore in both speed and energy efficiency, which recorded 600 seconds and 4.3 kWh, respectively.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00769'&gt;arXiv:2407.00769&lt;/a&gt;] Published Sun, 30 Jun 2024 17:14:59 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

Recently, superconducting artificial molecules (Andreev molecules) have opened new avenues to engineer topological superconducting materials. In this work, we demonstrate a heteroatomic Andreev molecule, where two normal artificial atoms realized by quantum dots (QDs) are coupled by a superconducting island (SCI). We show that the two normal atoms strongly hybridize and form a 3-electron-based molecular state. Our density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) calculations explain quantitatively the robust binding of electrons. The tunability of the structure allows us to drive a quantum phase transition from an antiferromagnetic Andreev molecular state to a heteroatomic Andreev molecule with ferromagnetically coupled QDs using simple electrical gating.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00825'&gt;arXiv:2407.00825&lt;/a&gt;] Published Sun, 30 Jun 2024 20:40:39 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Polaritonic Chemistry using the Density Matrix Renormalization Group Method</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01381</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Mikuláš Matoušek, Nam Vu, Niranjan Govind, Jonathan J. Foley IV, Libor Veis&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The emerging field of polaritonic chemistry explores the behavior of molecules under strong coupling with cavity modes. Despite recent developments in ab initio polaritonic methods for simulating polaritonic chemistry under electronic strong coupling, their capabilities are limited, especially in cases where the molecule also features strong electronic correlation. To bridge this gap, we have developed a novel method for cavity QED calculations utilizing the Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) algorithm in conjunction with the Pauli-Fierz Hamiltonian. Our approach is applied to investigate the effect of the cavity on the S0 -S1 transition of n-oligoacenes, with n ranging from 2 to 5, encompassing 22 fully correlated {\pi} orbitals in the largest pentacene molecule. Our findings indicate that the influence of the cavity intensifies with larger acenes. Additionally, we demonstrate that, unlike the full determinantal representation, DMRG efficiently optimizes and eliminates excess photonic degrees of freedom, resulting in an asymptotically constant computational cost as the photonic basis increases.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01381'&gt;arXiv:2407.01381&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 01 Jul 2024 15:32:59 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Quantum Simulation with Gauge Fixing: from Ising Lattice Gauge Theory to Dynamical Flux Model</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01422</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Junsen Wang, Xiangxiang Sun, Wei Zheng&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Quantum simulation of synthetic dynamic gauge field has attracted much attentions in recent years. There are two traditional ways to simulate gauge theories. One is to directly simulate the full Hamiltonian of gauge theories with local gauge symmetries. And the other is to engineer the projected Hamiltonian in one gauge subsector. In this work, we provide the third way towards the simulation of gauge theories based on gauge fixing. To demonstrate this concept, we fix the gauge of an Ising lattice gauge field coupled with spinless fermions on a ladder geometry. After the gauge fixing, this gauge theory is reduced to a simpler model, in which fermions hop on a ladder with a fluctuating dynamical $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ flux. Then we shows that this model can be realized via Floquet engineering in ultracold atomic gases. By analytical and numerical studies of this dynamical flux model, we deduce that there is confinement to deconfinement phase transition in the original unfixed gauge theory. This work paves the way to quantum simulate lattice gauge theory using the concept of gauge fixing, relevant both for condensed matter and high energy physics.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01422'&gt;arXiv:2407.01422&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 01 Jul 2024 16:12:17 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

We use tools provided by these networks to study the relationship between non-isometries and quantum extremal surfaces behind the horizon. Furthermore, we introduce a limited notion of dynamics for these interior tensor networks based on the qudit models introduced by Akers et al., and study the evolution of quantum extremal surfaces in an evaporating black hole. We also find a tensor network description of a wormhole connecting the black hole interior to the radiation, providing a mechanism for interior states and operators to be encoded in the radiation after the Page time. As a particular case, we construct a tensor network realization of the backwards-forwards maps recently proposed to incorporate non-trivial effective dynamics in dynamical constructions of these non-isometric black hole codes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01666'&gt;arXiv:2407.01666&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 01 Jul 2024 18:00:00 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Clifford Dressed Time-Dependent Variational Principle</title>

By leveraging the Clifford group, which maps Pauli strings to other Pauli strings while maintaining low computational complexity, we introduce a Clifford dressed single-site 1-TDVP scheme. During the TDVP integration, we apply a global Clifford transformation as needed to reduce entanglement by iteratively sweeping over two-qubit Clifford unitaries that connect neighboring sites in a checkerboard pattern. We validate the new algorithm numerically using various quantum many-body models, including both integrable and non-integrable systems. Our results demonstrate that the Clifford dressed TDVP significantly improves entanglement management and computational efficiency, achieving higher accuracy, extended simulation times, and enhanced precision in computed observables compared to standard TDVP approaches. Additionally, we propose incorporating Clifford gates directly within the two-site 2-TDVP scheme.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01692'&gt;arXiv:2407.01692&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 01 Jul 2024 18:04:25 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Federico Rottoli, Colin Rylands, Pasquale Calabrese&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The entanglement Hamiltonian (EH) provides the most comprehensive characterization of bipartite entanglement in many-body quantum systems. Ground states of local Hamiltonians inherit this locality, resulting in EHs that are dominated by local, few-body terms. Unfortunately, in non-equilibrium situations, analytic results are rare and largely confined to continuous field theories, which fail to accurately describe microscopic models. To address this gap, we present an analytic result for the EH following a quantum quench in non-interacting fermionic models, valid in the ballistic scaling regime. The derivation adapts the celebrated quasiparticle picture to operators, providing detailed insights into its physical properties. The resulting analytic formula serves as a foundation for engineering EHs in quantum optics experiments.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01730'&gt;arXiv:2407.01730&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 01 Jul 2024 19:03:47 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Many-body effects on high-harmonic generation in Hubbard ladders</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01936</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Yuta Murakami, Thomas Hansen, Shintaro Takayoshi, Lars Bojer Madsen, Philipp Werner&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We show how many-body effects associated with background spin dynamics control the high-harmonic generation (HHG) in Mott insulators by analyzing the two-leg ladder Hubbard model. Spin dynamics activated by the interchain hopping $t_y$ drastically modifies the HHG features. When two chains are decoupled ($t_y=0$), HHG originates from the dynamics of coherent doublon-holon pairs because of spin-charge separation. With increasing $t_y$, the doublon-holon pairs lose their coherence due to their interchain hopping and resultant spin-strings. Furthermore, the HHG signal from spin-polarons -- charges dressed by spin clouds -- leads to an additional plateau in the HHG spectrum. For large $t_y$, we identify unconventional HHG processes involving $three$ elementary excitations -- two polarons and one magnon. Our results demonstrate the nontrivial nature of HHG in strongly correlated systems, and its qualitative differences to conventional semiconductors.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01936'&gt;arXiv:2407.01936&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 02 Jul 2024 04:11:35 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Learning tensor networks with tensor cross interpolation: new algorithms and libraries</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02454</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Yuriel Núñez Fernández, Marc K. Ritter, Matthieu Jeannin, Jheng-Wei Li, Thomas Kloss, Thibaud Louvet, Satoshi Terasaki, Olivier Parcollet, Jan von Delft, Hiroshi Shinaoka, Xavier Waintal&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The tensor cross interpolation (TCI) algorithm is a rank-revealing algorithm for decomposing low-rank, high-dimensional tensors into tensor trains/matrix product states (MPS). TCI learns a compact MPS representation of the entire object from a tiny training data set. Once obtained, the large existing MPS toolbox provides exponentially fast algorithms for performing a large set of operations. We discuss several improvements and variants of TCI. In particular, we show that replacing the cross interpolation by the partially rank-revealing LU decomposition yields a more stable and more flexible algorithm than the original algorithm. We also present two open source libraries, xfac in Python/C++ and TensorCrossInterpolation.jl in Julia, that implement these improved algorithms, and illustrate them on several applications. These include sign-problem-free integration in large dimension, the superhigh-resolution quantics representation of functions, the solution of partial differential equations, the superfast Fourier transform, the computation of partition functions, and the construction of matrix product operators.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02454'&gt;arXiv:2407.02454&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 02 Jul 2024 17:32:29 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>A Max-Flow approach to Random Tensor Networks</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02559</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Khurshed Fitter, Faedi Loulidi, Ion Nechita&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We study the entanglement entropy of a random tensor network (RTN) using tools from free probability theory. Random tensor networks are simple toy models that help the understanding of the entanglement behavior of a boundary region in the ADS/CFT context. One can think of random tensor networks are specific probabilistic models for tensors having some particular geometry dictated by a graph (or network) structure. We first introduce our model of RTN, obtained by contracting maximally entangled states (corresponding to the edges of the graph) on the tensor product of Gaussian tensors (corresponding to the vertices of the graph). We study the entanglement spectrum of the resulting random spectrum along a given bipartition of the local Hilbert spaces. We provide the limiting eigenvalue distribution of the reduced density operator of the RTN state, in the limit of large local dimension. The limit value is described via a maximum flow optimization problem in a new graph corresponding to the geometry of the RTN and the given bipartition. In the case of series-parallel graphs, we provide an explicit formula for the limiting eigenvalue distribution using classical and free multiplicative convolutions. We discuss the physical implications of our results, allowing us to go beyond the semiclassical regime without any cut assumption, specifically in terms of finite corrections to the average entanglement entropy of the RTN.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02559'&gt;arXiv:2407.02559&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 02 Jul 2024 18:00:01 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Low variance estimations of many observables with tensor networks and informationally-complete measurements</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Stefano Mangini, Daniel Cavalcanti&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Accurately estimating the properties of quantum systems is a central challenge in quantum computing and quantum information. We propose a method to obtain unbiased estimators of multiple observables with low statistical error by post-processing informationally complete measurements using tensor networks. Compared to other observable estimation protocols based on classical shadows and measurement frames, our approach offers several advantages: (i) it can be optimised to provide lower statistical error, resulting in a reduced measurement budget to achieve a specified estimation precision; (ii) it scales to a large number of qubits due to the tensor network structure; (iii) it can be applied to any measurement protocol with measurement operators that have an efficient tensor-network representation. We benchmark the method through various numerical examples, including spin and chemical systems, and show that our method can provide statistical error that are orders of magnitude lower than the ones given by classical shadows.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02923'&gt;arXiv:2407.02923&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 03 Jul 2024 08:55:37 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Tensor Networks for Lattice Gauge Theories beyond one dimension: a Roadmap</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03058</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Giuseppe Magnifico, Giovanni Cataldi, Marco Rigobello, Peter Majcen, Daniel Jaschke, Pietro Silvi, Simone Montangero&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Tensor network methods are a class of numerical tools and algorithms to study many-body quantum systems in and out of equilibrium, based on tailored variational wave functions. They have found significant applications in simulating lattice gauge theories approaching relevant problems in high-energy physics. Compared to Monte Carlo methods, they do not suffer from the sign problem, allowing them to explore challenging regimes such as finite chemical potentials and real-time dynamics. Further development is required to tackle fundamental challenges, such as accessing continuum limits or computations of large-scale quantum chromodynamics. In this work, we review the state-of-the-art of Tensor Network methods and discuss a possible roadmap for algorithmic development and strategies to enhance their capabilities and extend their applicability to open high-energy problems. We provide tailored estimates of the theoretical and computational resource scaling for attacking large-scale lattice gauge theories.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03058'&gt;arXiv:2407.03058&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 03 Jul 2024 12:30:04 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Clifford Circuits Augmented Time-Dependent Variational Principle</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03202</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Xiangjian Qian, Jiale Huang, Mingpu Qin&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The recently proposed Clifford Circuits Augmented Matrix Product States (CA-MPS) (arXiv:2405.09217) seamlessly augments Density Matrix Renormalization Group with Clifford circuits. In CA-MPS, the entanglement from stabilizers is transferred to the Clifford circuits which can be easily handled according to the Gottesman-Knill theorem. As a result, MPS needs only to deal with the non-stabilizer entanglement, which largely reduce the bond dimension and the resource required for the accurate simulation of many-body systems. In this work, we generalize CA-MPS to the framework of Time-Dependent Variational Principle (TDVP) for time evolution simulations. In this method, we apply Clifford circuits to the resulting MPS in each TDVP step with a two-site sweeping process similar as in DMRG, aiming at reducing the entanglement entropy in the MPS, and the Hamiltonian is transformed accordingly using the chosen Clifford circuits. Similar as in CA-MPS, the Clifford circuits doesn't increase the number of terms in the Hamiltonian which makes the overhead very small in the new method. We test this method in both XXZ chain and two dimensional Heisenberg model. The results show that the Clifford circuits augmented TDVP method can reduce the entanglement entropy in the time evolution process and hence makes the simulation reliable for longer time. The Clifford circuits augmented Time-Dependent Variational Principle provides a useful tool for the simulation of time evolution process of many-body systems in the future.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03202'&gt;arXiv:2407.03202&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 03 Jul 2024 15:34:15 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>When big data actually are low-rank, or entrywise approximation of certain function-generated matrices</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03250</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Stanislav Budzinskiy&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The article concerns low-rank approximation of matrices generated by sampling a smooth function of two $m$-dimensional variables. We identify several misconceptions surrounding a claim that, for a specific class of analytic functions, such $n \times n$ matrices admit accurate entrywise approximation of rank that is independent of $m$ and grows as $\log(n)$ -- colloquially known as ''big-data matrices are approximately low-rank''. We provide a theoretical explanation of the numerical results presented in support of this claim, describing three narrower classes of functions for which function-generated matrices can be approximated within an entrywise error of order $\varepsilon$ with rank $\mathcal{O}(\log(n) \varepsilon^{-2} \log(\varepsilon^{-1}))$ that is independent of the dimension $m$: (i) functions of the inner product of the two variables, (ii) functions of the Euclidean distance between the variables, and (iii) shift-invariant positive-definite kernels. We extend our argument to tensor-train approximation of tensors generated with functions of the ''higher-order inner product'' of their multiple variables. We discuss our results in the context of low-rank approximation of (a) growing datasets and (b) attention in transformer neural networks.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03250'&gt;arXiv:2407.03250&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 03 Jul 2024 16:29:47 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Meson Mass Sets Onset Time of Anomalous Dynamical Quantum Phase Transitions</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Jesse J. Osborne, Johannes Knaute, Ian P. McCulloch, Jad C. Halimeh&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Dynamical quantum phase transitions (DQPTs) have been established as a rigorous framework for investigating far-from-equilibrium quantum many-body criticality. Although initially thought to be trivially connected to an order parameter flipping sign, a certain kind of \textit{anomalous} DQPTs have been discovered that exhibit no direct connection to the order parameter and have been shown to arise in the presence of confinement. Here, we show in two paradigmatic models how the onset time of anomalous DQPTs is directly connected, through a power law, to the meson mass in the confined regime of a global symmetry-broken phase. This relation becomes more prominent the closer the initial parameters are to the equilibrium quantum critical point, where a relativistic quantum field theory emerges. Our findings draw a direct connection between mesons and anomalous DQPTs, highlighting the power of the latter to classify exotic far-from-equilibrium criticality.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03394'&gt;arXiv:2407.03394&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 03 Jul 2024 18:00:00 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>2500 vibronic eigenstates of the NO$_3$ radical</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Henrik R. Larsson, Alexandra Viel&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The nitrate radical NO$_3$ plays an important role in atmospheric chemistry, yet many aspects of its coupled and anharmonic vibronic structure remain elusive. Here, using an accurate, coupled full-dimensional diabatic potential that includes five electronic states, we revisit the vibronic spectrum associated with the electronic $\tilde X ^2A_2'$ state. Using recently developed tensor network state methods, we are able to compute more than 2500 vibronic states, thereby increasing the number of computed full-dimensional states by a factor of 50, compared to previous work. While we obtain good agreement with experiment for most of the assigned vibronic levels, for several others, we observe striking disagreement. Further, for the antisymmetric bending motion we find remarkably large symmetry-induced level splittings that are larger than the zero-order reference. We discuss non-negligible nonadiabatic effects and show that the Born-Oppenheimer approximation leads to significant errors in the spectrum.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03398'&gt;arXiv:2407.03398&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 03 Jul 2024 18:00:00 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Magic spreading in random quantum circuits</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Xhek Turkeshi, Emanuele Tirrito, Piotr Sierant&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Magic is the resource that quantifies the amount of beyond-Clifford operations necessary for universal quantum computing. It bounds the cost of classically simulating quantum systems via stabilizer circuits central to quantum error correction and computation. How rapidly do generic many-body dynamics generate magic resources under the constraints of locality and unitarity? We address this central question by exploring magic spreading in brick-wall random unitary circuits. We explore scalable magic measures intimately connected to the algebraic structure of the Clifford group. These metrics enable the investigation of the spreading of magic for system sizes of up to $N=1024$ qudits, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art, which was restricted to about a dozen qudits. We demonstrate that magic resources equilibrate on timescales logarithmic in the system size, akin to anti-concentration and Hilbert space delocalization phenomena, but qualitatively different from the spreading of entanglement entropy. As random circuits are minimal models for chaotic dynamics, we conjecture that our findings describe the phenomenology of magic resources growth in a broad class of chaotic many-body systems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03929'&gt;arXiv:2407.03929&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 04 Jul 2024 13:43:46 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Measuring multipartite quantum correlations by thermodynamic work extraction</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04058</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Toshihiro Yada, Nobuyuki Yoshioka, Takahiro Sagawa&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Quantum correlations are at the core of quantum mechanics and play a crucial role in various fields. While bipartite quantum correlations have been extensively studied, multipartite quantum correlations in many-body systems remain elusive due to their complex structure. In particular, a primary challenge lies in the fact that the calculation of multipartite quantum correlation measure often requires exponential cost. In this work, we tackle this problem by adopting a thermodynamic approach; we introduce a measure of multipartite quantum correlations based on the difference in extractable thermodynamic work by global operations and local operations and classical communication (LOCC). This can be regarded as a multipartite generalization of the work deficit, which has attracted attention as a thermodynamic measure of bipartite quantum correlation. A distinguishing feature of the thermodynamic approach to multipartite quantum correlation is that we can compare the degree of quantum correlations with clear operational meaning. Importantly, we develop an efficient calculation method of the multipartite work deficit. This efficient method works for a special class of quantum many-body systems described by matrix product states (MPS), where the numerical cost is shown to be proportional to the system size, significantly reducing the exponential cost required for the direct calculations. We demonstrate this efficient method in the AKLT state and the cluster state, and analytically obtain the exact values of this measure. We further show that a quantum phase transition described by MPS is well captured by the multipartite work deficit. This shows that the multipartite work deficit does not only highlight the fundamental connection between multipartite quantum correlations and quantum thermodynamics, but also serves as an efficiently-computable probe of the structures of quantum many-body systems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04058'&gt;arXiv:2407.04058&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 04 Jul 2024 16:58:30 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

Utilizing Yurke and Denker's quantum circuit network theory within the framework of continuous MERA (cMERA) in AdS space, we analyze the quantization and interactions of transmission lines. The metric is revealed to be described by the inductance of the quantum circuit, which is AdS-space in its 0-limit. These results provide new insights into handling and controlling complex phenomena in quantum circuits, potentially advancing the understanding of quantum computing and quantum communication.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04171'&gt;arXiv:2407.04171&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 04 Jul 2024 22:09:31 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

It is based on adding fresh qubits at each Trotter step, which enables a simpler implementation of the dynamics in the extended system. After each step, the extra qubits are recycled, so that the whole process accurately approximates the correct unitary evolution. A key ingredient of the approach is an isometry that maps a simple, diagonal Hamiltonian in the extended system to the original one, and we give a procedure to compute this isometry. We estimate the error at each time step, as well as the number of gates, which scales as $O(N^2)$, where $N$ is the number of orbitals. We illustrate our results with three examples: the Hydrogen chain, small molecules, and the FeMoco molecule. In the Hydrogen chain and the Hydrogen molecule we observe that the error scales in the same way as the Trotter error. For FeMoco, we estimate the number of gates in a fault-tolerant setup.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04432'&gt;arXiv:2407.04432&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 05 Jul 2024 11:27:09 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Quantum algorithm for partial differential equations of non-conservative systems with spatially varying parameters</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05019</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Yuki Sato, Hiroyuki Tezuka, Ruho Kondo, Naoki Yamamoto&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Partial differential equations (PDEs) are crucial for modeling various physical phenomena such as heat transfer, fluid flow, and electromagnetic waves. In computer-aided engineering (CAE), the ability to handle fine resolutions and large computational models is essential for improving product performance and reducing development costs. However, solving large-scale PDEs, particularly for systems with spatially varying material properties, poses significant computational challenges. In this paper, we propose a quantum algorithm for solving second-order linear PDEs of non-conservative systems with spatially varying parameters, using the linear combination of Hamiltonian simulation (LCHS) method. Our approach transforms those PDEs into ordinary differential equations represented by qubit operators, through spatial discretization using the finite difference method. Then, we provide an algorithm that efficiently constructs the operator corresponding to the spatially varying parameters of PDEs via a logic minimization technique, which reduces the number of terms and subsequently the circuit depth. We also develop a scalable method for realizing a quantum circuit for LCHS, using a tensor-network-based technique, specifically a matrix product state (MPS). We validate our method with applications to the acoustic equation with spatially varying parameters and the dissipative heat equation. Our approach includes a detailed recipe for constructing quantum circuits for PDEs, leveraging efficient encoding of spatially varying parameters of PDEs and scalable implementation of LCHS, which we believe marks a significant step towards advancing quantum computing's role in solving practical engineering problems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05019'&gt;arXiv:2407.05019&lt;/a&gt;] Published Sat, 06 Jul 2024 09:23:04 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Quantum Supercritical Crossover with Dynamical Singularity</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05455</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Junsen Wang, Enze Lv, Xinyang Li, Yuliang Jin, Wei Li&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Supercritical states, characterized by strong fluctuations and intriguing phenomena, emerge above the critical point. In this study, we extend this notable concept of supercriticality from classical to quantum systems near the quantum critical point, by studying the one- and two-dimensional quantum Ising models through tensor network calculations and scaling analyses. We reveal the existence of quantum supercritical (QSC) crossover lines, determined by not only response functions but also quantum information quantities. A supercritical scaling law, $h \sim (g - g_c)^{\Delta}$, is revealed, where $g$ ($h$) is the transverse (longitudinal) field, $g_c$ is the critical field, and $\Delta$ is a critical exponent. Moreover, we uncover the QSC crossover line defines a boundary for the dynamical singularity to appear in quench dynamics, which can be ascribed to the intersection between the Lee-Yang zero line and the real-time axis. In particular, when the Hamiltonian parameter is quenched to the QSC crossover line, a singular cusp with exponent 1/2 emerge in the Loschmidt rate function, signaling a new dynamical universality class different from the linear cusp for $h=0$. Possible platforms, such as quantum simulators and quantum magnets are proposed for studying QSC crossovers in experiments. Our work paves the way for exploring QSC crossovers in and out of equilibrium in quantum many-body systems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05455'&gt;arXiv:2407.05455&lt;/a&gt;] Published Sun, 07 Jul 2024 17:52:02 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Ground-state phase diagram of the SU($4$) Heisenberg model on a plaquette lattice</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05556</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Ryui Kaneko, Shimpei Goto, Ippei Danshita&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We investigate the ground state of the SU($4$) Heisenberg model on a square lattice with spatial anisotropy on each plaquette bond using the tensor-network method based on infinite projected entangled pair states. We find that the SU($4$) singlet ground state appears in the strongly anisotropic limit, whereas Néel and valence-bond crystal orders coexist in the nearly isotropic limit. By examining the intermediate parameter region, we identify a phase transition between these phases. The nature of the phase transition is likely to be of first order, and the transition point is estimated to be around $J'/J\approx 0.85(5)$, where $J$ and $J'$ are the interaction strengths of intra- and interplaquette bonds, respectively. We also calculate the anisotropy dependence of singlet correlations on a plaquette bond, which will be useful for future experiments of ultracold atoms in optical lattices.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05556'&gt;arXiv:2407.05556&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 08 Jul 2024 02:14:44 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Persistent oscillation of a Cooper-pair condensate of topological defects in a nonintegrable quantum Ising chain</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06036</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Francis A. Bayocboc Jr., Jacek Dziarmaga, Marek M. Rams, Wojciech H. Zurek&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We identify persistent oscillations in a nonintegrable quantum Ising chain. In the integrable chain with nearest-neighbor interactions, the nature, origin, and decay of post-transition oscillations are tied to the Kibble-Zurek mechanism. Remarkably, when coupling to the next-nearest neighbor is added, the resulting nonintegrable ''zigzag'' chain (still in the quantum Ising universality class) supports persistent oscillation: Topological defects (kinks) appear as a result of the quantum phase transition. However, in a ''zigzag'' Ising chain defects can form Cooper pairs. The oscillation of the Cooper-pair condensate has a frequency that depends on the binding energy gap between the paired and the unpaired defects, so it can be excited by resonant driving. While one might have expected that the integrability-breaking ''zigzag'' coupling causes relaxation, the oscillations we identify are persistent: Their longevity in our simulations is likely limited only by numerical accuracy. This oscillation of the Cooper-pair condensate of kinks is a manifestation of quantum coherence and should be experimentally accessible.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06036'&gt;arXiv:2407.06036&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 08 Jul 2024 15:35:42 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Fast and spectrally accurate construction of adaptive diagonal basis sets for electronic structure</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06171</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Michael Lindsey, Sandeep Sharma&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; In this article, we combine the periodic sinc basis set with a curvilinear coordinate system for electronic structure calculations. This extension allows for variable resolution across the computational domain, with higher resolution close to the nuclei and lower resolution in the inter-atomic regions. We address two key challenges that arise while using basis sets obtained by such a coordinate transformation. First, we use pseudospectral methods to evaluate the integrals needed to construct the Hamiltonian in this basis. Second, we demonstrate how to construct an appropriate coordinate transformation by solving the Monge-Amp\`ere equation using a new approach that we call the cyclic Knothe-Rosenblatt flow. The solution of both of these challenges enables mean-field calculations at a cost that is log-linear in the number of basis functions. We demonstrate that our method approaches the complete basis set limit faster than basis sets with uniform resolution. We also emphasize how these basis sets satisfy the diagonal approximation, which is shown to be a consequence of the pseudospectral method. The diagonal approximation is highly desirable for the solution of the electronic structure problem in many frameworks, including mean field theories, tensor network methods, quantum computing, and quantum Monte Carlo.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06171'&gt;arXiv:2407.06171&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 08 Jul 2024 17:48:40 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Many-body Liouvillian dynamics with a non-Hermitian tensor-network kernel polynomial algorithm</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Guangze Chen, Jose L. Lado, Fei Song&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Understanding the dynamics of open quantum many-body systems is a major problem in quantum matter. Specifically, efficiently solving the spectrum of the Liouvillian superoperator governing such dynamics remains a critical open challenge. Here, we put forward a method for solving the many-body Liouvillian spectrum and dynamics based on the non-Hermitian kernel polynomial method and tensor-network techniques. We demonstrate the faithfulness of our method by computing the dynamics of the dephasing quantum compass model with a gradient magnetic field and comparing it with exact results. In particular, we show that our method allows us to characterize the quantum Zeno crossover and the reduction of relaxation rate due to Stark localization in this model. We further demonstrate the ability of our method to go beyond exact results by exploring nearest-neighbor interaction effects on the Liouvillian dynamics, elucidating the interplay between Stark localization and many-body interactions. Our method provides an efficient solution to many-body Liouvillian spectrum and dynamics, establishing a methodology to explore large open quantum many-body systems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06282'&gt;arXiv:2407.06282&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 08 Jul 2024 18:00:24 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

We consider as specific model the critical XXZ spin chain, which breaks the $SU(2)$ symmetry of spin rotations except at the isotropic point, and is described by the massless compact boson in the continuum limit. We examine the $U(1)$ subgroup of $SU(2)$ that is broken outside the isotropic point by applying conformal perturbation theory, which we complement with numerical simulations on the lattice. We also analyse the entanglement asymmetry of the full $SU(2)$ group. By relying on very generic scaling arguments, we derive an asymptotic expression for it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06427'&gt;arXiv:2407.06427&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 08 Jul 2024 22:16:22 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

Izmaylov&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Linear combination of unitaries (LCU) decompositions have appeared as one of the main tools for encoding operators on quantum computers, allowing efficient implementations of arbitrary operators.

Over the past years, many different decomposition techniques have appeared for the electronic structure Hamiltonian.

      <title>Luttinger liquid tensor network: sine versus tangent dispersion of massless Dirac fermions</title>

Beenakker&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; To apply the powerful many-body techniques of tensor networks to massless Dirac fermions one wants to discretize the $p\cdot\sigma$ Hamiltonian and construct a matrix-product-operator (MPO) representation. We compare two alternative discretization schemes, one with a sine dispersion, the other with a tangent dispersion, applied to a one-dimensional Luttinger liquid with Hubbard interaction. Both types of lattice fermions allow for an exact MPO representation of low bond dimension, so they are efficiently computable, but only the tangent dispersion gives a power law decay of the propagator in agreement with the continuum limit: The sine dispersion is gapped by the interactions, evidenced by an exponentially decaying propagator. Our construction of a tensor network with an unpaired Dirac cone works around the fermion-doubling obstruction by exploiting the fact that the \textit{nonlocal} Hamiltonian of tangent fermions permits a \textit{local} generalized eigenproblem.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06713'&gt;arXiv:2407.06713&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 09 Jul 2024 09:39:58 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

We provide evidence that the generalized model interpolating between these two lattices features an extended quantum spin liquid ground state, which is gapless on the ruby lattice and gapped on the maple-leaf lattice, with the transition between the two occurring midway. We present equal-time spin structure factors which further characterize the nature of the presumed quantum spin liquid. Our results are based on one of the most extensive state-of-the-art variational infinite tensor network calculations to date, thereby helping us to resolve the long-standing issue of the delicate competition between magnetically ordered and paramagnetic states in this family of models.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07145'&gt;arXiv:2407.07145&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 09 Jul 2024 18:00:01 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Tensor network approximation of Koopman operators</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07242</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Dimitrios Giannakis, Mohammad Javad Latifi Jebelli, Michael Montgomery, Philipp Pfeffer, Jörg Schumacher, Joanna Slawinska&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We propose a tensor network framework for approximating the evolution of observables of measure-preserving ergodic systems. Our approach is based on a spectrally-convergent approximation of the skew-adjoint Koopman generator by a diagonalizable, skew-adjoint operator $W_\tau$ that acts on a reproducing kernel Hilbert space $\mathcal H_\tau$ with coalgebra structure and Banach algebra structure under the pointwise product of functions. Leveraging this structure, we lift the unitary evolution operators $e^{t W_\tau}$ (which can be thought of as regularized Koopman operators) to a unitary evolution group on the Fock space $F(\mathcal H_\tau)$ generated by $\mathcal H_\tau$ that acts multiplicatively with respect to the tensor product. Our scheme also employs a representation of classical observables ($L^\infty$ functions of the state) by quantum observables (self-adjoint operators) acting on the Fock space, and a representation of probability densities in $L^1$ by quantum states. Combining these constructions leads to an approximation of the Koopman evolution of observables that is representable as evaluation of a tree tensor network built on a tensor product subspace $\mathcal H_\tau^{\otimes n} \subset F(\mathcal H_\tau)$ of arbitrarily high grading $n \in \mathbb N$. A key feature of this quantum-inspired approximation is that it captures information from a tensor product space of dimension $(2d+1)^n$, generated from a collection of $2d + 1$ eigenfunctions of $W_\tau$. Furthermore, the approximation is positivity preserving. The paper contains a theoretical convergence analysis of the method and numerical applications to two dynamical systems on the 2-torus: an ergodic torus rotation as an example with pure point Koopman spectrum and a Stepanoff flow as an example with topological weak mixing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07242'&gt;arXiv:2407.07242&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 09 Jul 2024 21:40:14 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Haar Nuclear Norms with Applications to Remote Sensing Imagery Restoration</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Shuang Xu, Chang Yu, Jiangjun Peng, Xiangyong Cao, Deyu Meng&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Remote sensing image restoration aims to reconstruct missing or corrupted areas within images. To date, low-rank based models have garnered significant interest in this field. This paper proposes a novel low-rank regularization term, named the Haar nuclear norm (HNN), for efficient and effective remote sensing image restoration. It leverages the low-rank properties of wavelet coefficients derived from the 2-D frontal slice-wise Haar discrete wavelet transform, effectively modeling the low-rank prior for separated coarse-grained structure and fine-grained textures in the image. Experimental evaluations conducted on hyperspectral image inpainting, multi-temporal image cloud removal, and hyperspectral image denoising have revealed the HNN's potential. Typically, HNN achieves a performance improvement of 1-4 dB and a speedup of 10-28x compared to some state-of-the-art methods (e.g., tensor correlated total variation, and fully-connected tensor network) for inpainting tasks.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08509'&gt;arXiv:2407.08509&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 11 Jul 2024 13:46:47 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>XYZ ruby code: Making a case for a three-colored graphical calculus for quantum error correction in spacetime</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08566</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Julio C. Magdalena de la Fuente, Josias Old, Alex Townsend-Teague, Manuel Rispler, Jens Eisert, Markus Müller&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Analyzing and developing new quantum error-correcting schemes is one of the most prominent tasks in quantum computing research. In such efforts, introducing time dynamics explicitly in both analysis and design of error-correcting protocols constitutes an important cornerstone. In this work, we present a graphical formalism based on tensor networks to capture the logical action and error-correcting capabilities of any Clifford circuit with Pauli measurements. We showcase the formalism on new Floquet codes derived from topological subsystem codes, which we call XYZ ruby codes. Based on the projective symmetries of the building blocks of the tensor network we develop a framework of Pauli flows. Pauli flows allow for a graphical understanding of all quantities entering an error correction analysis of a circuit, including different types of QEC experiments, such as memory and stability experiments. We lay out how to derive a well-defined decoding problem from the tensor network representation of a protocol and its Pauli flows alone, independent of any stabilizer code or fixed circuit. Importantly, this framework applies to all Clifford protocols and encompasses both measurement- and circuit-based approaches to fault tolerance. We apply our method to our new family of dynamical codes which are in the same topological phase as the 2+1d color code, making them a promising candidate for low-overhead logical gates. In contrast to its static counterpart, the dynamical protocol applies a Z3 automorphism to the logical Pauli group every three timesteps. We highlight some of its topological properties and comment on the anyon physics behind a planar layout. Lastly, we benchmark the performance of the XYZ ruby code on a torus by performing both memory and stability experiments and find competitive circuit-level noise thresholds of 0.18%, comparable with other Floquet codes and 2+1d color codes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08566'&gt;arXiv:2407.08566&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 11 Jul 2024 14:56:26 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Three-component fractional quantum Hall effect in topological flat bands</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Tian-Sheng Zeng&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We study the many-body ground states of three-component quantum particles in two prototypical topological lattice models under strong intercomponent and intracomponent repulsions. At band filling $\nu=3/4$ for hardcore bosons, we demonstrate the emergence of three-component fractional quantum Hall (FQH) effect characterized by the $\mathbf{K}$ matrix, through exact diagonalization study of four-fold quasidegenerate ground states with a robust spectrum gap and the combined density-matrix renormalization group calculation of fractional drag charge pumping. Further we formulate the topological characterization of FQH states of three-component Bose-Fermi mixtures at various fillings by the $\mathbf{K}$ matrix. At last we discuss the possible generalization of our approach to identify non-Abelian three-component spin-singlet FQH states.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08568'&gt;arXiv:2407.08568&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 11 Jul 2024 14:58:16 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Characterizing Translation-Invariant Bell Inequalities using Tropical Algebra and Graph Polytopes</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08783</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Mengyao Hu, Eloïc Vallée, Tim Seynnaeve, Patrick Emonts, Fatemeh Mohammadi, Jordi Tura&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Nonlocality is one of the key features of quantum physics, which is revealed through the violation of a Bell inequality. In large multipartite systems, nonlocality characterization quickly becomes a challenging task. A common practice is to make use of symmetries, low-order correlators, or exploiting local geometries, to restrict the class of inequalities. In this paper, we characterize translation-invariant (TI) Bell inequalities with finite-range correlators in one-dimensional geometries. We introduce a novel methodology based on tropical algebra tensor networks and highlight its connection to graph theory. Surprisingly, we find that the TI Bell polytope has a number of extremal points that can be uniformly upper-bounded with respect to the system size. We give an efficient method to list all vertices of the polytope for a particular system size, and characterize the tightness of a given TI Bell inequality. The connections highlighted in our work allow us to re-interpret concepts developed in the fields of tropical algebra and graph theory in the context of Bell nonlocality, and vice-versa. This work extends a parallel article [M. Hu \textit{et al.}, arXiv: 2208.02798 (2022)] on the same subject.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08783'&gt;arXiv:2407.08783&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 11 Jul 2024 18:00:06 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Diagnosing quantum transport from wave function snapshots</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09092</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Devendra Singh Bhakuni, Roberto Verdel, Cristiano Muzzi, Riccardo Andreoni, Monika Aidelsburger, Marcello Dalmonte&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We study nonequilibrium quantum dynamics of spin chains by employing principal component analysis (PCA) on data sets of wave function snapshots and examine how information propagates within these data sets. The quantities we employ are derived from the spectrum of the sample second moment matrix, built directly from data sets. Our investigations on several interacting spin chains featuring distinct spin or energy transport reveal that the growth of data information spreading follows the same dynamical exponents as that of the underlying quantum transport of spin or energy. Specifically, our approach enables an easy, data-driven, and importantly interpretable diagnostic to track energy transport with a limited number of samples, which is usually challenging without any assumption on the Hamiltonian form. These observations are obtained at a modest finite size and evolution time, which aligns with experimental and numerical constraints. Our framework directly applies to experimental quantum simulator data sets of dynamics in higher-dimensional systems, where classical simulation methods usually face significant limitations and apply equally to both near- and far-from-equilibrium quenches.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09092'&gt;arXiv:2407.09092&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 12 Jul 2024 08:40:32 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Tensor networks enable the calculation of turbulence probability distributions</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09169</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Nikita Gourianov, Peyman Givi, Dieter Jaksch, Stephen B. Pope&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Predicting the dynamics of turbulent fluid flows has long been a central goal of science and engineering. Yet, even with modern computing technology, accurate simulation of all but the simplest turbulent flow-fields remains impossible: the fields are too chaotic and multi-scaled to directly store them in memory and perform time-evolution. An alternative is to treat turbulence $\textit{probabilistically}$, viewing flow properties as random variables distributed according to joint probability density functions (PDFs). Turbulence PDFs are neither chaotic nor multi-scale, but are still challenging to simulate due to their high dimensionality. Here we show how to overcome the dimensionality problem by parameterising turbulence PDFs into an extremely compressed format known as a "tensor network" (TN). The TN paradigm enables simulations on single CPU cores that would otherwise be impractical even with supercomputers: for a $5+1$ dimensional PDF of a chemically reactive turbulent flow, we achieve reductions in memory and computational costs by factors of $\mathcal{O}(10^6)$ and $\mathcal{O}(10^3)$, respectively, compared to standard finite difference algorithms. A future path is opened towards something heretofore regarded as infeasible: directly simulating high-dimensional PDFs of both turbulent flows and other chaotic systems that are useful to describe probabilistically.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09169'&gt;arXiv:2407.09169&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 12 Jul 2024 11:06:57 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Chebyshev approximation and composition of functions in matrix product states for quantum-inspired numerical analysis</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09609</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Juan José Rodríguez-Aldavero, Paula García-Molina, Luca Tagliacozzo, Juan José García-Ripoll&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; This work explores the representation of univariate and multivariate functions as matrix product states (MPS), also known as quantized tensor-trains (QTT). It proposes an algorithm that employs iterative Chebyshev expansions and Clenshaw evaluations to represent analytic and highly differentiable functions as MPS Chebyshev interpolants. It demonstrates rapid convergence for highly-differentiable functions, aligning with theoretical predictions, and generalizes efficiently to multidimensional scenarios. The performance of the algorithm is compared with that of tensor cross-interpolation (TCI) and multiscale interpolative constructions through a comprehensive comparative study. When function evaluation is inexpensive or when the function is not analytical, TCI is generally more efficient for function loading. However, the proposed method shows competitive performance, outperforming TCI in certain multivariate scenarios. Moreover, it shows advantageous scaling rates and generalizes to a wider range of tasks by providing a framework for function composition in MPS, which is useful for non-linear problems and many-body statistical physics.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09609'&gt;arXiv:2407.09609&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 12 Jul 2024 18:00:06 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Spectral Density Modulation and Universal Markovian Closure of Fermionic Environments</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10017</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Davide Ferracin, Andrea Smirne, Susana F. Huelga, Martin B. Plenio, Dario Tamascelli&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The combination of chain-mapping and tensor-network techniques provides a powerful tool for the numerically exact simulation of open quantum systems interacting with structured environments. However, these methods suffer from a quadratic scaling with the physical simulation time, and therefore they become challenging in the presence of multiple environments. This is particularly true when fermionic environments, well-known to be highly correlated, are considered. In this work we first illustrate how a thermo-chemical modulation of the spectral density allows replacing the original fermionic environments with equivalent, but simpler, ones. Moreover, we show how this procedure reduces the number of chains needed to model multiple environments. We then provide a derivation of the fermionic Markovian closure construction, consisting of a small collection of damped fermionic modes undergoing a Lindblad-type dynamics and mimicking a continuum of bath modes. We describe, in particular, how the use of the Markovian closure allows for a polynomial reduction of the time complexity of chain-mapping based algorithms when long-time dynamics are needed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10017'&gt;arXiv:2407.10017&lt;/a&gt;] Published Sat, 13 Jul 2024 22:13:44 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Efficient tensor network simulation of multi-emitter non-Markovian systems</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10140</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Irene Papaefstathiou, Daniel Malz, J. Ignacio Cirac, Mari Carmen Bañuls&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We present a numerical method to simulate a system of multiple emitters coupled to a non-interacting bath, in any parameter regime. Our method relies on a Block Lanczos transformation that maps the whole system onto a strip geometry, whose width is given by the number of emitters. Utilizing the spatial symmetries of the problem and identifying the relevant range of energies of the bath we achieve a more efficient simulation, which we perform using tensor network techniques. As a demonstration, we study the collective emission from multiple emitters coupled to a square lattice of bosons and observe how the departure from Markovianity as coupling strength and emitter number is increased prevents collective radiation. We also simulate the dynamic preparation of an excitation in a bound state from a multi-excitation initial state. Our work opens new possibilities for the systematic exploration of non-Markovian effects in the dynamics and equilibrium properties of multi-emitter systems. Furthermore, it can easily be extended to other setups, including finite bath temperature or impurities coupled to fermionic environments.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10140'&gt;arXiv:2407.10140&lt;/a&gt;] Published Sun, 14 Jul 2024 10:24:23 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Building holographic code from the boundary</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Wei Wang&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Holographic quantum error-correcting code, the quantum-information structure hypothesized for the AdS/CFT correspondence, has being attracting increasing attention in new directions interrelating the studies of quantum gravity and quantum simulation. In this work, we initiate a novel approach for building holographic code that can be generally applied in potentially broad and interdisciplinary contexts. Our approach takes an "opposite" route to the conventional paradigm that is based on bulk tensor-networks. As illustrated in an exact model, we start from scalable descriptions of boundary qudits which can guide succinct quantum-circuit simulations, and rigorously show how the bulk qudits and the encoding structure emerge from boundary entanglement patterns. By investigating the entanglement patterns, we systematically unfold the hypothetical structure for bulk reconstruction and the details of the Ryu-Takayanagi formula in the formalism of operator-algebra quantum error correction, demonstrating desired properties that are not yet proved in the established models. Our work might offer a fresh perspective for the study of holographic code.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10271'&gt;arXiv:2407.10271&lt;/a&gt;] Published Sun, 14 Jul 2024 16:51:17 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

Using the tensor renormalization group, both the complex action problem and topological freezing problem in the standard Monte Carlo simulation are avoided. We find the first-order phase transition with sufficiently large Higgs mass at $\theta=\pi$, where the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ charge conjugation symmetry is spontaneously broken. On the other hand, the symmetry is restored with a sufficiently small mass. We determine the critical endpoint as a function of the Higgs mass parameter and show the critical behavior is in the two-dimensional Ising universality class.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10409'&gt;arXiv:2407.10409&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 15 Jul 2024 03:02:06 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Variational Quantum Imaginary Time Evolution for Matrix Product State Ansatz with Tests on Transcorrelated Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10523</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Hao-En Li, Xiang Li, Jia-Cheng Huang, Guang-Ze Zhang, Zhu-Ping Shen, Chen Zhao, Jun Li, Han-Shi Hu&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The matrix product state (MPS) ansatz offers a promising approach for finding the ground state of molecular Hamiltonians and solving quantum chemistry problems. Building on this concept, the proposed technique of quantum circuit MPS (QCMPS) enables the simulation of chemical systems using a relatively small number of qubits. In this study, we enhance the optimization performance of the QCMPS ansatz by employing the variational quantum imaginary time evolution (VarQITE) approach. Guided by McLachlan's variational principle, the VarQITE method provides analytical metrics and gradients, resulting in improved convergence efficiency and robustness of the QCMPS. We validate these improvements numerically through simulations of $\rm H_2$, $\rm H_4$, and $\rm LiH$ molecules. Additionally, given that VarQITE is applicable to non-Hermitian Hamiltonians, we evaluate its effectiveness in preparing the ground state of transcorrelated (TC) Hamiltonians. This approach yields energy estimates comparable to the complete basis set (CBS) limit while using even fewer qubits. Specifically, we perform simulations of the beryllium atom and $\rm LiH$ molecule using only three qubits, maintaining high fidelity with the CBS ground state energy of these systems. This qubit reduction is achieved through the combined advantages of both the QCMPS ansatz and transcorrelation. Our findings demonstrate the potential practicality of this quantum chemistry algorithm on near-term quantum devices.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10523'&gt;arXiv:2407.10523&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 15 Jul 2024 08:28:52 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Entanglement scaling and charge fluctuations in a Fermi liquid of composite fermions</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11119</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Cristian Voinea, Songyang Pu, Ajit C. Balram, Zlatko Papić&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The composite fermion Fermi liquid (CFL) state at $\nu=1/2$ filling of a Landau level is a paradigmatic non-Fermi liquid borne out purely by Coulomb interactions. But in what ways is this exotic state of matter different from a Fermi liquid? The CFL entanglement entropy was indeed found to exhibit a significant enhancement compared to free electrons [Shao et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 114, 206402 (2015)], which was subsequently ruled out as a finite-size effect by the study of a lattice CFL analog [Mishmash and Motrunich, Phys. Rev. B 94, 081110 (2016)]. Moreover, the enhancement was not observed in a quasi-one-dimensional limit of the Coulomb ground state at $\nu=1/2$ [Geraedts et al., Science 352, 197 (2016)]. Here, we revisit the problem of entanglement scaling in the CFL state realized in a two-dimensional electron gas. Using Monte Carlo evaluation of the second Rényi entropy $S_2$ for the CFL variational wave function, we show that the entanglement enhancement is present not only at $\nu=1/2$ but also at $\nu=1/4$, as well as in bosonic CFL states at $\nu=1$ and $\nu=1/3$ fillings. In all cases, we find the scaling of $S_2$ with subsystem size to be enhanced compared to the non-interacting case, and insensitive to the choice of geometry and projection to the lowest Landau level. We also demonstrate that, for CFL states, the variance of the particle number in a subsystem obeys area-law scaling with a universal subleading corner contribution, in stark contrast with free fermions. Our results establish the enhanced entanglement scaling and suppressed charge fluctuations as fingerprints of non-Fermi-liquid correlations in CFL states.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11119'&gt;arXiv:2407.11119&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 15 Jul 2024 18:00:01 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Discrete generative diffusion models without stochastic differential equations: a tensor network approach</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11133</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Luke Causer, Grant M. Rotskoff, Juan P. Garrahan&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Diffusion models (DMs) are a class of generative machine learning methods that sample a target distribution by transforming samples of a trivial (often Gaussian) distribution using a learned stochastic differential equation. In standard DMs, this is done by learning a ``score function'' that reverses the effect of adding diffusive noise to the distribution of interest. Here we consider the generalisation of DMs to lattice systems with discrete degrees of freedom, and where noise is added via Markov chain jump dynamics. We show how to use tensor networks (TNs) to efficiently define and sample such ``discrete diffusion models'' (DDMs) without explicitly having to solve a stochastic differential equation. We show the following: (i) by parametrising the data and evolution operators as TNs, the denoising dynamics can be represented exactly; (ii) the auto-regressive nature of TNs allows to generate samples efficiently and without bias; (iii) for sampling Boltzmann-like distributions, TNs allow to construct an efficient learning scheme that integrates well with Monte Carlo. We illustrate this approach to study the equilibrium of two models with non-trivial thermodynamics, the $d=1$ constrained Fredkin chain and the $d=2$ Ising model.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11133'&gt;arXiv:2407.11133&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 15 Jul 2024 18:00:11 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

Various sequential and parallel TT decomposition algorithms have been proposed for different tensor inputs and assumptions. In this paper, we propose subtensor parallel adaptive TT cross, which partitions a tensor onto distributed memory machines with multidimensional process grids, and constructs an TT approximation iteratively with tensor elements. We derive two iterative formulations for pivot selection and TT core construction under the distributed memory setting, conduct communication and scaling analysis of the algorithm, and illustrate its performance with multiple test experiments. These include up to 6D Hilbert tensors and tensors constructed from Maxwellian distribution functions that arise in kinetic theory. Our results demonstrate significant accuracy with greatly reduced storage requirements via the TT cross approximation.

      <title>Dynamical quantum phase transition and thermal equilibrium in the lattice Thirring model</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Mari Carmen Bañuls, Krzysztof Cichy, Hao-Ti Hung, Ying-Jer Kao, C. -J. David Lin, Amit Singh&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Using tensor network methods, we simulate the real-time evolution of the lattice Thirring model quenched out of equilibrium in both the critical and massive phases and study the appearance of dynamical quantum phase transitions, as nonanalyticities in the Loschmidt rate. Although the presence of a dynamical quantum phase transition in the model does not correspond to quenches across the critical line of the equilibrium phase diagram at zero temperature, we identify a threshold in the energy density of the initial state, necessary for a dynamical quantum phase transition to be present. Moreover, in the case of the gapped quench Hamiltonian, we unveil a connection of this threshold to a transition between different regions in the finite-temperature phase diagram.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11295'&gt;arXiv:2407.11295&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 16 Jul 2024 00:51:01 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Accurate Numerical Simulations of Open Quantum Systems Using Spectral Tensor Trains</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11327</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Ryan T. Grimm, Joel D. Eaves&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Decoherence between qubits is a major bottleneck in quantum computations. Decoherence results from intrinsic quantum and thermal fluctuations as well as noise in the external fields that perform the measurement and preparation processes. With prescribed colored noise spectra for intrinsic and extrinsic noise, we present a numerical method, Quantum Accelerated Stochastic Propagator Evaluation (Q-ASPEN), to solve the time-dependent noise-averaged reduced density matrix in the presence of intrinsic and extrinsic noise. Q-ASPEN is arbitrarily accurate and can be applied to provide estimates for the resources needed to error-correct quantum computations. We employ spectral tensor trains, which combine the advantages of tensor networks and pseudospectral methods, as a variational ansatz to the quantum relaxation problem and optimize the ansatz using methods typically used to train neural networks. The spectral tensor trains in Q-ASPEN make accurate calculations with tens of quantum levels feasible. We present benchmarks for Q-ASPEN on the spin-boson model in the presence of intrinsic noise and on a quantum chain of up to 32 sites in the presence of extrinsic noise. In our benchmark, the memory cost of Q-ASPEN scales linearly with the system size once the number of states is larger than the number of basis functions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11327'&gt;arXiv:2407.11327&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 16 Jul 2024 02:33:27 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>DMRG study of the theta-dependent mass spectrum in the 2-flavor Schwinger model</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11391</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Etsuko Itou, Akira Matsumoto, Yuya Tanizaki&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We study the $\theta$-dependent mass spectrum of the massive $2$-flavor Schwinger model in the Hamiltonian formalism using the density-matrix renormalization group(DMRG). The masses of the composite particles, the pion and sigma meson, are computed by two independent methods. One is the improved one-point-function scheme, where we measure the local meson operator coupled to the boundary state and extract the mass from its exponential decay. Since the $\theta$ term causes a nontrivial operator mixing, we unravel it by diagonalizing the correlation matrix to define the meson operator. The other is the dispersion-relation scheme, a heuristic approach specific to Hamiltonian formalism. We obtain the dispersion relation directly by measuring the energy and momentum of the excited states. The sign problem is circumvented in these methods, and their results agree with each other even for large $\theta$. We reveal that the $\theta$-dependence of the pion mass at $m/g=0.1$ is consistent with the prediction by the bosonized model. We also find that the mass of the sigma meson satisfies the semi-classical formula, $M_{\sigma}/M_{\pi}=\sqrt{3}$, for almost all region of $\theta$. While the sigma meson is a stable particle thanks to this relation, the eta meson is no longer protected by the $G$-parity and becomes unstable for $\theta\neq 0$.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11391'&gt;arXiv:2407.11391&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 16 Jul 2024 05:23:20 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Simple Fermionic backflow states via a systematically improvable tensor decomposition</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Massimo Bortone, Yannic Rath, George H. Booth&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We present an effective ansatz for the wave function of correlated electrons that brings closer the fields of machine learning parameterizations and tensor rank decompositions. We consider a CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) tensor factorization of a general backflow transformation in second quantization for a simple, compact and systematically improvable Fermionic state. This directly encodes $N$-body correlations without the ordering dependence of other tensor decompositions. We consider and explicitly demonstrate various controllable truncations, in the rank and range of the backflow correlations or magnitude of local energy contributions, in order to systematically affect scaling reductions to $\mathcal{O}[N^{3-4}]$. Benchmarking against small Fermi-Hubbard and chemical systems reveals an improvement over other NQS-like models, while extending towards larger strongly correlated ab initio systems demonstrates competitive accuracy with more established DMRG techniques on ab initio 2D hydrogenic lattices with realistic long-range Coulomb interactions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11779'&gt;arXiv:2407.11779&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 16 Jul 2024 14:37:20 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>A hierarchical dynamical low-rank algorithm for the stochastic description of large reaction networks</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11792</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Lukas Einkemmer, Julian Mangott, Martina Prugger&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The stochastic description of chemical reaction networks with the kinetic chemical master equation (CME) is important for studying biological cells, but it suffers from the curse of dimensionality: The amount of data to be stored grows exponentially with the number of chemical species and thus exceeds the capacity of common computational devices for realistic problems. Therefore, time-dependent model order reduction techniques such as the dynamical low-rank approximation are desirable. In this paper we propose a dynamical low-rank algorithm for the kinetic CME using binary tree tensor networks. The dimensionality of the problem is reduced in this approach by hierarchically dividing the reaction network into partitions. Only reactions that cross partitions are subject to an approximation error. We demonstrate by two numerical examples (a 5-dimensional lambda phage model and a 20-dimensional reaction cascade) that the proposed method drastically reduces memory consumption and shows improved computational performance and better accuracy compared to a Monte Carlo method.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11792'&gt;arXiv:2407.11792&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 16 Jul 2024 14:46:44 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Far from Perfect: Quantum Error Correction with (Hyperinvariant) Evenbly Codes</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11926</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Matthew Steinberg, Junyu Fan, Robert J. Harris, David Elkouss, Sebastian Feld, Alexander Jahn&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We introduce a new class of qubit codes that we call Evenbly codes, building on a previous proposal of hyperinvariant tensor networks. Its tensor network description consists of local, non-perfect tensors describing CSS codes interspersed with Hadamard gates, placed on a hyperbolic $\{p,q\}$ geometry with even $q\geq 4$, yielding an infinitely large class of subsystem codes. We construct an example for a $\{5,4\}$ manifold and describe strategies of logical gauge fixing that lead to different rates $k/n$ and distances $d$, which we calculate analytically, finding distances which range from $d=2$ to $d \sim n^{2/3}$. Investigating threshold performance under erasure, depolarizing, and pure Pauli noise channels, we find that the code exhibits a depolarizing noise threshold of about 19.1% in the code-capacity model and 50% for pure Pauli and erasure channels under suitable gauges. We also test a constant-rate version with $k/n = 0.125$, finding excellent error resilience (about 40%) under the erasure channel. Recovery rates for these and other settings are studied both under an optimal decoder as well as a more efficient but non-optimal greedy decoder. We also consider generalizations beyond the CSS tensor construction, compute error rates and thresholds for other hyperbolic geometries, and discuss the relationship to holographic bulk/boundary dualities. Our work indicates that Evenbly codes may show promise for practical quantum computing applications.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11926'&gt;arXiv:2407.11926&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 16 Jul 2024 17:18:13 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Minimally Entangled Typical Thermal States for Classical and Quantum Simulation of 1+1-Dimensional $\mathbb Z_2$ Lattice Gauge Theory at Finite Temperature and Density</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11949</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; I-Chi Chen, João C. Getelina, Klée Pollock, Aleksei Khindanov, Srimoyee Sen, Yong-Xin Yao, Thomas Iadecola&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Simulating strongly coupled gauge theories at finite temperature and density is a longstanding challenge in nuclear and high-energy physics that also has fundamental implications for condensed matter physics. In this work, we use minimally entangled typical thermal state (METTS) approaches to facilitate both classical and quantum computational studies of such systems. METTS techniques combine classical random sampling with imaginary time evolution, which can be performed on either a classical or a quantum computer, to estimate thermal averages of observables. We study 1+1-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory coupled to spinless fermionic matter, which maps onto a local quantum spin chain. We benchmark both a classical matrix-product-state implementation of METTS and a recently proposed adaptive variational approach that is a promising candidate for implementation on near-term quantum devices, focusing on the equation of state as well as on various measures of fermion confinement. Of particular importance is the choice of basis for obtaining new METTS samples, which impacts both the classical sampling complexity (a key factor in both classical and quantum simulation applications) and complexity of circuits used in the quantum computing approach. Our work sets the stage for future studies of strongly coupled gauge theories with both classical and quantum hardware.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11949'&gt;arXiv:2407.11949&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 16 Jul 2024 17:44:01 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Quantum and Classical Dynamics with Random Permutation Circuits</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11960</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Bruno Bertini, Katja Klobas, Pavel Kos, Daniel Malz&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Understanding thermalisation in quantum many-body systems is among the most enduring problems in modern physics. A particularly interesting question concerns the role played by quantum mechanics in this process, i.e. whether thermalisation in quantum many-body systems is fundamentally different from that in classical many-body systems and, if so, which of its features are genuinely quantum. Here we study this question in minimally structured many-body systems which are only constrained to have local interactions, i.e. local random circuits. We introduce a class of random permutation circuits (RPCs), where the gates locally permute basis states modelling generic microscopic classical dynamics, and compare them to random unitary circuits (RUCs), a standard toy model for generic quantum dynamics. We show that, like RUCs, RPCs permit the analytical computation of several key quantities such as out-of-time order correlators (OTOCs), or entanglement entropies. RPCs can be interpreted both as quantum or classical dynamics, which we use to find similarities and differences between the two. Performing the average over all random circuits, we discover a series of exact relations, connecting quantities in RUC and (quantum) RPCs. In the classical setting, we obtain similar exact results relating (quantum) purity to (classical) growth of mutual information and (quantum) OTOCs to (classical) decorrelators. Our results indicate that despite of the fundamental differences between quantum and classical systems, their dynamics exhibits qualitatively similar behaviours.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11960'&gt;arXiv:2407.11960&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 16 Jul 2024 17:58:03 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Gapless deconfined phase in a $\mathbb{Z}_N$ symmetric Hamiltonian created in a cold-atom setup</title>

Rakov, Luca Tagliacozzo, Maciej Lewenstein, Jakub Zakrzewski, Titas Chanda&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We investigate a quasi-two-dimensional system consisting of two species of alkali atoms confined in a specific optical lattice potential [Phys. Rev. A 95, 053608 (2017)]. In the low-energy regime, this system is governed by a unique $\mathbb{Z}_N$ gauge theory, where field theory arguments have suggested that it may exhibit two exotic gapless deconfined phases, namely a dipolar liquid phase and a Bose liquid phase, along with two gapped (confined and deconfined) phases. We address these predictions numerically by using large-scale density matrix renormalization group simulations. Our findings provide conclusive evidence for the existence of a gapless Bose liquid phase for $N \geq 7$. We demonstrate that this gapless phase shares the same critical properties as one-dimensional critical phases, resembling weakly coupled chains of Luttinger liquids. In the range of ladder and cylinder geometries and $N$ considered, the gapless dipolar phase predicted theoretically is still elusive and its characterization will probably require a full two-dimensional treatment.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12109'&gt;arXiv:2407.12109&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 16 Jul 2024 18:32:57 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

This is done in such a way that multiple evolution steps applied to this subspace can be viewed as a single evolution step of a new quantum cellular automaton, whose cells are the subspaces themselves. We derive a necessary and sufficient condition for renormalizability and use it to investigate the renormalization flow of cellular automata on a line, where the cells are qubits and the tiles are composed of two neighboring cells. The problem is exhaustively solved, and the fixed points of the renormalization flow are highlighted.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12652'&gt;arXiv:2407.12652&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 17 Jul 2024 15:33:33 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

Clerk&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We show that several models of interacting XXZ spin chains subject to boundary driving and dissipation possess a subtle kind of time-reversal symmetry, making their steady states exactly solvable. We focus on a model with a coherent boundary drive, showing that it exhibits a unique continuous dissipative phase transition as a function of the boundary drive amplitude. This transition has no analogue in the bulk closed system, or in incoherently driven models. We also show the steady state magnetization exhibits a surprising fractal dependence on interaction strength, something previously associated with less easily measured infinite-temperature transport quantities (the Drude weight). Our exact solution also directly yields driven-dissipative double-chain models that have pure, entangled steady states that are also current carrying.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12750'&gt;arXiv:2407.12750&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 17 Jul 2024 17:12:53 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Exact projected entangled pair ground states with topological Euler invariant</title>

Jankowski, Adrien Bouhon, Gaurav Chaudhary, Robert-Jan Slager&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We report on a class of gapped projected entangled pair states (PEPS) with non-trivial Euler topology motivated by recent progress in band geometry. In the non-interacting limit, these systems have optimal conditions relating to saturation of quantum geometrical bounds, allowing for parent Hamiltonians whose lowest bands are completely flat and which have the PEPS as unique ground states. Protected by crystalline symmetries, these states evade restrictions on capturing tenfold-way topological features with gapped PEPS. These PEPS thus form the first tensor network representative of a non-interacting, gapped two-dimensional topological phase, similar to the Kitaev chain in one dimension. Using unitary circuits, we then formulate interacting variants of these PEPS and corresponding gapped parent Hamiltonians. We reveal characteristic entanglement features shared between the free-fermionic and interacting states with Euler topology. Our results hence provide a rich platform of PEPS models that have, unexpectedly, a finite topological invariant, forming the basis for new spin liquids, quantum Hall physics, and quantum information pursuits.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12902'&gt;arXiv:2407.12902&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 17 Jul 2024 18:00:00 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>State-dependent mobility edge in kinetically constrained models</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12909</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Manthan Badbaria, Nicola Pancotti, Rajeev Singh, Jamir Marino, Riccardo J. Valencia-Tortora&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; In this work, we show that the kinetically constrained quantum East model lies between a quantum scarred and a many-body localized system featuring an unconventional type of mobility edge in the spectrum. We name this scenario $\textit{state-dependent}$ mobility edge: while the system does not exhibit a sharp separation in energy between thermal and non-thermal eigenstates, the abundance of non-thermal eigenstates results in slow entanglement growth for $\textit{many}$ initial states, such as product states, below a finite energy density. We characterize the state-dependent mobility edge by looking at the complexity of classically simulating dynamics using tensor network for system sizes well beyond those accessible via exact diagonalization. Focusing on initial product states, we observe a qualitative change in the dynamics of the bond dimension needed as a function of their energy density. Specifically, the bond dimension typically grows $\textit{polynomially}$ in time up to a certain energy density, where we locate the state-dependent mobility edge, enabling simulations for long times. Above this energy density, the bond dimension typically grows $\textit{exponentially}$ making the simulation practically unfeasible beyond short times, as generally expected in interacting theories. We correlate the polynomial growth of the bond dimension to the presence of many non-thermal eigenstates around that energy density, a subset of which we compute via tensor network. The outreach of our findings encompasses quantum sampling problems and the efficient simulation of quantum circuits beyond Clifford families.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12909'&gt;arXiv:2407.12909&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 17 Jul 2024 18:00:01 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Optimal Tree Tensor Network Operators for Tensor Network Simulations: Applications to Open Quantum Systems</title>

In this work, we present an algorithm that automatically constructs the optimal and exact tree tensor network operators (TTNO) for any sum-of-product symbolic quantum operator.The construction is based on the minimum vertex cover of a bipartite graph. With the optimal TTNO, we simulate open quantum systems such as spin relaxation dynamics in the spin-boson model and charge transport in molecular junctions. In these simulations, the environment is treated as discrete modes and its wavefunction is evolved on equal footing with the system. We employ the Cole-Davidson spectral density to model the glassy phonon environment, and incorporate temperature effects via thermo field dynamics. Our results show that the computational cost scales linearly with the number of discretized modes, demonstrating the efficiency of our approach.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13098'&gt;arXiv:2407.13098&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 18 Jul 2024 02:15:52 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13249</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Richard M. Milbradt, Qunsheng Huang, Christian B. Mendl&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; In recent years, tree tensor network methods have proven capable of simulating quantum many-body and other high-dimensional systems. This work is a user guide to our Python library PyTreeNet. It includes code examples and exercises to introduce the library's functions and familiarise the reader with the concepts and methods surrounding tree tensor networks. PyTreeNet implements all the tools required to implement general tree tensor network methods, such as tensor decompositions and arbitrary tree structures. The main focus is on the time evolution of quantum systems. This includes an introduction to tree tensor network states and operators and the time-evolving block decimation and time-dependent variational principle. The library's capabilities are showcased with the example of a modified transverse field Ising model on tree structures that go far beyond the ability of common state vector methods.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13249'&gt;arXiv:2407.13249&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 18 Jul 2024 08:03:38 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>VeriQR: A Robustness Verification Tool for Quantum Machine Learning Models</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13533</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Yanling Lin, Ji Guan, Wang Fang, Mingsheng Ying, Zhaofeng Su&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Adversarial noise attacks present a significant threat to quantum machine learning (QML) models, similar to their classical counterparts. This is especially true in the current Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum era, where noise is unavoidable. Therefore, it is essential to ensure the robustness of QML models before their deployment. To address this challenge, we introduce \textit{VeriQR}, the first tool designed specifically for formally verifying and improving the robustness of QML models, to the best of our knowledge. This tool mimics real-world quantum hardware's noisy impacts by incorporating random noise to formally validate a QML model's robustness. \textit{VeriQR} supports exact (sound and complete) algorithms for both local and global robustness verification. For enhanced efficiency, it implements an under-approximate (complete) algorithm and a tensor network-based algorithm to verify local and global robustness, respectively. As a formal verification tool, \textit{VeriQR} can detect adversarial examples and utilize them for further analysis and to enhance the local robustness through adversarial training, as demonstrated by experiments on real-world quantum machine learning models. Moreover, it permits users to incorporate customized noise. Based on this feature, we assess \textit{VeriQR} using various real-world examples, and experimental outcomes confirm that the addition of specific quantum noise can enhance the global robustness of QML models. These processes are made accessible through a user-friendly graphical interface provided by \textit{VeriQR}, catering to general users without requiring a deep understanding of the counter-intuitive probabilistic nature of quantum computing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13533'&gt;arXiv:2407.13533&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 18 Jul 2024 14:06:02 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Quantum-classical correspondence in quantum channels</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14067</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Bidhi Vijaywargia, Arul Lakshminarayan&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Quantum channels describe subsystem or open system evolution. Using the classical Koopman operator that evolves functions on phase space, 4 classical Koopman channels are identified that are analogs of the 4 possible quantum channels in a bipartite setting. Thus when the complete evolution has a quantum-classical correspondence the correspondence at the level of the subunitary channels can be studied. The channels, both classical and quantum can be interpreted as noisy single particle systems. Having parallel classical and quantum operators gives us new access to study fine details of these major limiting theories. Using a coupled kicked rotor as a generic example, we contrast and compare spectra of the quantum and classical channel. The largest nontrivial mode of the quantum channel is seen to be mostly determined by the stable parts of the classical phase space, even those that are surprisingly small in relation to the scale of an effective $\hbar$. In the case when the dynamics has a significant fraction of chaos the spectrum has a prominent annular density that is approximately described by the single-ring theorem of random matrix theory, and the ring shrinks in size when the classical limit is approached. However, the eigenvalues and modes that survive the classical limit seem to be either scarred by unstable manifolds or, if they exist, stable periodic orbits.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14067'&gt;arXiv:2407.14067&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 19 Jul 2024 06:53:45 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Metal-insulator transition of spinless fermions coupled to dispersive optical bosons</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14187</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Florian Lange, Holger Fehske&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Including the previously ignored dispersion of phonons we revisit the metal-insulator transition problem in one-dimensional electron-phonon systems on the basis of a modified spinless fermion Holstein model. Using matrix-product-state techniques we determine the global ground-state phase diagram in the thermodynamic limit for the half-filled band case, and show that in particular the curvature of the bare phonon band has a significant effect, not only on the transport properties characterized by the conductance and the Luttinger liquid parameter, but also on the phase space structure of the model as a whole. While a downward curved (convex) dispersion of the phonons only shifts the Tomonaga-Luttinger-liquid to charge-density-wave quantum phase transition towards stronger EP coupling, an upward curved (concave) phonon band leads to a new phase-separated state which, in the case of strong dispersion, can even completely cover the charge-density wave. Such phase separation does not occur in the related Edwards fermion-boson model.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14187'&gt;arXiv:2407.14187&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 19 Jul 2024 10:31:08 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Initial tensor construction and dependence of the tensor renormalization group on initial tensors</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14226</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Katsumasa Nakayama, Manuel Schneider&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We propose a method to construct a tensor network representation of partition functions without singular value decompositions nor series expansions. The approach is demonstrated for one- and two-dimensional Ising models and we study the dependence of the tensor renormalization group (TRG) on the form of the initial tensors and their symmetries. We further introduce variants of several tensor renormalization algorithms. Our benchmarks reveal a significant dependence of various TRG algorithms on the choice of initial tensors and their symmetries. However, we show that the boundary TRG technique can eliminate the initial tensor dependence for all TRG methods. The numerical results of TRG calculations can thus be made significantly more robust with only a few changes in the code. Furthermore, we study a three-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory without gauge-fixing and confirm the applicability of the initial tensor construction. Our method can straightforwardly be applied to systems with longer range and multi-site interactions, such as the next-nearest neighbor Ising model.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14226'&gt;arXiv:2407.14226&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 19 Jul 2024 11:52:51 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Fragment quantum embedding using the Householder transformation: a multi-state extension based on ensembles</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14278</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Filip Cernatic, Emmanuel Fromager, Saad Yalouz&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; In recent works by Yalouz et al. (J. Chem. Phys. 157, 214112, 2022) and Sekaran et al. (Phys. Rev. B 104, 035121, 2021; Computation 10, 45, 2022), Density Matrix Embedding Theory (DMET) has been reformulated through the use of the Householder transformation as a novel tool to embed a fragment within extended systems. The transformation was applied to a reference non-interacting one-electron reduced density matrix to construct fragments' bath orbitals, which are crucial for subsequent ground state calculations. In the present work, we expand upon these previous developments and extend the utilization of the Householder transformation to the description of multiple electronic states, including ground and excited states. Based on an ensemble noninteracting density matrix, we demonstrate the feasibility of achieving exact fragment embedding through successive Householder transformations, resulting in a larger set of bath orbitals. We analytically prove that the number of additional bath orbitals scales directly with the number of fractionally occupied natural orbitals in the reference ensemble density matrix. A connection with the regular DMET bath construction is also made. Then, we illustrate the use of this ensemble embedding tool in single-shot DMET calculations to describe both ground and first excited states in a Hubbard lattice model and an ab initio hydrogen system. Lastly, we discuss avenues for enhancing ensemble embedding through self-consistency and explore potential future directions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14278'&gt;arXiv:2407.14278&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 19 Jul 2024 13:00:23 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Thermal Pure States for Systems with Antiunitary Symmetries and Their Tensor Network Representations</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14454</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Yasushi Yoneta&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Thermal pure state algorithms, which employ pure quantum states representing thermal equilibrium states instead of statistical ensembles, are useful both for numerical simulations and for theoretical analysis of thermal states. However, their inherently large entanglement makes it difficult to represent efficiently and limits their use in analyzing large systems. Here, we propose a new tensor network algorithm for constructing thermal pure states for systems with certain antiunitary symmetries, such as time-reversal or complex conjugate symmetry. Our method utilizes thermal pure states that, while exhibiting volume-law entanglement, can be mapped to tensor network states through simple transformations. Furthermore, our approach does not rely on random sampling and thus avoids statistical uncertainty. Moreover, we can compute not only thermal expectation values of local observables but also thermodynamic quantities. We demonstrate the validity and utility of our method by applying it to the one-dimensional XY model and the two-dimensional Ising model on a triangular lattice. Our results suggest a new class of variational wave functions for volume-law states that are not limited to thermal equilibrium states.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14454'&gt;arXiv:2407.14454&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 19 Jul 2024 16:52:29 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Holographic analysis of boundary correlation functions for the hyperbolic-lattice Ising model</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14689</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Kouichi Okunishi, Tomotoshi Nishino&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We analyze boundary spin correlation functions of the hyperbolic-lattice Ising model from the holographic point of view. Using the corner-transfer-matrix renormalization group (CTMRG) method, we demonstrate that the boundary correlation function exhibits power-law decay with quasi-periodic oscillation, while the bulk correlation function always decays exponentially. On the basis of the geometric relation between the bulk correlation path and distance along the outer edge boundary, we find that scaling dimensions for the boundary correlation function can be well explained by the combination of the bulk correlation length and background curvatures inherent to the hyperbolic lattice. We also investigate the cutoff effect of the bond dimension in CTMRG, revealing that the long-distance behavior of the boundary spin correlation is accurately described even with a small bond dimension. In contrast, the sort-distance behavior rapidly loses its accuracy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14689'&gt;arXiv:2407.14689&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 19 Jul 2024 22:16:06 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Geometric phase and multipartite entanglement of Rydberg atom chains</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Chang-Yan Wang&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We investigate the behavior of geometric phase (GP) and geometric entanglement (GE), a multipartite entanglement measure, across quantum phase transitions in Rydberg atom chains. Using density matrix renormalization group calculations and finite-size scaling analysis, we characterize the critical properties of transitions between disordered and ordered phases. Both quantities exhibit characteristic scaling near transition points, with the disorder to $Z_2$ ordered phase transition showing behavior consistent with the Ising universality class, while the disorder to $Z_3$ phase transition displays distinct critical properties. We demonstrate that GP and GE serve as sensitive probes of quantum criticality, providing consistent critical parameters and scaling behavior. A unifying description of these geometric quantities from a quantum geometry perspective is explored, and an interferometric setup for their potential measurement is discussed. Our results provide insights into the interplay between geometric phase and multipartite entanglement near quantum phase transitions in Rydberg atom systems, revealing how these quantities reflect the underlying critical behavior in these complex quantum many-body systems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14854'&gt;arXiv:2407.14854&lt;/a&gt;] Published Sat, 20 Jul 2024 11:53:46 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Beyond Boundaries: efficient Projected Entangled Pair States methods for periodic quantum systems</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15333</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Shaojun Dong, Chao Wang, Hao Zhang, Meng Zhang, Lixin He&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Projected Entangled Pair States (PEPS) are recognized as a potent tool for exploring two-dimensional quantum many-body systems. However, a significant challenge emerges when applying conventional PEPS methodologies to systems with periodic boundary conditions (PBC), attributed to the prohibitive computational scaling with the bond dimension. This has notably restricted the study of systems with complex boundary conditions. To address this challenge, we have developed a strategy that involves the superposition of PEPS with open boundary conditions (OBC) to treat systems with PBC. This approach significantly reduces the computational complexity of such systems while maintaining their translational invariance and the PBC. We benchmark this method against the Heisenberg model and the $J_1$-$J_2$ model, demonstrating its capability to yield highly accurate results at low computational costs, even for large system sizes. The techniques are adaptable to other boundary conditions, including cylindrical and twisted boundary conditions, and therefore significantly expands the application scope of the PEPS approach, shining new light on numerous applications.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15333'&gt;arXiv:2407.15333&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 22 Jul 2024 02:37:29 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Time evolution of the local density of states of strongly correlated fermions coupled to a nanoprobe</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15609</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Tobias Blum, Reinhard M. Noack, Salvatore R. Manmana&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We study the time evolution of a one-dimensional system of strongly correlated electrons (a 'sample') that is suddenly coupled to a smaller, initially empty system (a 'nanoprobe'), which can subsequently move along the system. Our purpose here is to study the role of interactions in this model system when it is far from equilibrium. We therefore take both the sample and the nanoprobe to be described by a Hubbard model with on-site repulsive interactions and nearest-neighbor hopping. We compute the behavior of the local particle density and the local density of states (LDOS) as a function of time using time-dependent matrix product states at quarter and at half filling, fillings at which the chain realizes a Luttinger liquid or a Mott insulator, respectively. This allows us to study in detail the oscillation of the particles between the sample and the nanoprobe. While, for noninteracting systems, the LDOS is time-independent, in the presence of interactions, the backflow of electrons to the sample will lead to nontrivial dynamics in the LDOS. In particular, studying the time-dependent LDOS allows us to study how the Mott gap closes locally and how this melting of the Mott insulator propagates through the system in time after such a local perturbation -- a behavior that we envisage can be investigated in future experiments on ultrashort time scales or on optical lattices using microscopy setups.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15609'&gt;arXiv:2407.15609&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 22 Jul 2024 13:08:32 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Concurrent VQE for Simulating Excited States of the Schwinger Model</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Yibin Guo, Takis Angelides, Karl Jansen, Stefan Kühn&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; This work explores the application of the concurrent variational quantum eigensolver (cVQE) for computing excited states of the Schwinger model. By designing suitable ansatz circuits utilizing universal SO(4) or SO(8) qubit gates, we demonstrate how to efficiently obtain the lowest two, four, and eight eigenstates with one, two, and three ancillary qubits for both vanishing and non-vanishing background electric field cases. Simulating the resulting quantum circuits classically with tensor network techniques, we demonstrate the capability of our approach to compute the two lowest eigenstates of systems with up to $\mathcal{O}(100)$ qubits. Given that our method allows for measuring the low-lying spectrum precisely, we also present a novel technique for estimating the additive mass renormalization of the lattice based on the energy gap. As a proof-of-principle calculation, we prepare the ground and first-excited states with one ancillary and four physical qubits on quantum hardware, demonstrating the practicality of using the cVQE to simulate excited states.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15629'&gt;arXiv:2407.15629&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 22 Jul 2024 13:42:02 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Topological floating phase of dipolar bosons in an optical ladder</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Henning Korbmacher, Gustavo A. Domínguez-Castro, Mateusz Łącki, Jakub Zakrzewski, Luis Santos&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Ultracold dipolar hard-core bosons in optical ladders provide exciting possibilities for the quantum simulation of anisotropic XXZ spin ladders. We show that introducing a tilt along the rungs results in a rich phase diagram at unit filling. In particular, for a sufficiently strong dipolar strength, the interplay between the long-range tail of the dipolar interactions and the tilting leads to the emergence of a quantum floating phase, a critical phase with incommensurate density-density correlations. Interestingly, the study of the entanglement spectrum, reveals that the floating phase is topological, constituting an intermediate gapless stage in the melting of a crystal into a gapped topological Haldane phase. This novel scenario for topological floating phases in dipolar XXZ ladders can be investigated in on-going experiments.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15710'&gt;arXiv:2407.15710&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 22 Jul 2024 15:18:15 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Studying the 3d Ising surface CFTs on the fuzzy sphere</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15914</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Zheng Zhou, Yijian Zou&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Boundaries not only are fundamental elements in nearly all realistic physical systems, but also greatly enrich the structure of quantum field theories. In this paper, we demonstrate that conformal field theory (CFT) with a boundary, known as surface CFT in three dimensions, can be studied with the setup of fuzzy sphere. We consider the example of surface criticality of the 3D Ising CFT. We propose two schemes by cutting a boundary in the orbital space or the real space to realise the ordinary and the normal surface CFTs on the fuzzy sphere. We obtain the operator spectra through state-operator correspondence. We observe integer spacing of the conformal multiplets, and thus provide direct evidence of conformal symmetry. We identify the ordinary surface primary $o$, the displacement operator $\mathrm{D}$ and their conformal descendants and extract their scaling dimensions. We also study the one-point and two-point correlation functions and extract the bulk-to-surface OPE coefficients, some of which are reported for the first time. In addition, using the overlap of the bulk CFT state and the polarised state, we calculate the boundary central charges of the 3D Ising surface CFTs non-perturbatively. Other conformal data obtained in this way also agrees with prior methods.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15914'&gt;arXiv:2407.15914&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 22 Jul 2024 18:00:00 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

In addition to the common gapless and mixed Mott insulator phases, we identify unknown gapped states, in which bosons couple with some or all flavors of fermions.

      <title>Ising BCFT from Fuzzy Hemisphere</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Mykola Dedushenko&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We extend the recently introduced fuzzy sphere technique for the 3d Ising CFT to the case of boundary CFT (BCFT) using the fuzzy hemisphere. This allows to study conformal boundary conditions, and we investigate the three boundary universality classes of the 3d Ising CFT. These include the ordinary, extraordinary, and special boundary conditions. We identify the qualitative signatures of boundary conformal invariance, and in the cases of ordinary and extraordinary boundary conditions, obtain numerical estimates for the spectrum of low-lying boundary primaries. For the special boundary conditions, we are only able to see their qualitative features, while reliable estimates of the scaling dimensions of boundary primaries are left for the future work.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15948'&gt;arXiv:2407.15948&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 22 Jul 2024 18:02:21 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

Mendoza-Arenas&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We explore a system composed of scalar bosons and SU($3$) fermions in one dimension. Considering only local intra- and interspecies interactions, the system is described by the Bose-Fermi-Hubbard Hamiltonian, which is studied using the density matrix renormalization group method. In addition to the common gapless and mixed Mott insulator phases, we identify unknown gapped states, in which bosons couple with some or all flavors of fermions. We unveil different flavor-selective states characterized by itinerant fermions that coexist with an insulator state where the bosons tie with only one- or two-flavor fermions.

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Yuichiro Minato&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; In the field of quantum computing, combinatorial optimization problems are typically addressed using QUBO (Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization) solvers. However, these solvers are often insufficient for tackling higher-order problems. In this paper, we introduce a novel and efficient solver designed specifically for HOBO (Higher-Order Binary Optimization) problem settings. Our approach leverages advanced techniques to effectively manage the complexity and computational demands associated with high-dimensional optimization tasks. The proposed solver is a promising tool with significant potential for future extensions in terms of formulation. This solver holds promising potential for a wide range of applications in quantum computing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16106'&gt;arXiv:2407.16106&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 23 Jul 2024 00:33:34 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Ballistic Entanglement Cloud after a Boundary Quench</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16279</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Bedoor Alkurtass, Abolfazl Bayat, Pasquale Sodano, Sougato Bose, Henrik Johannesson&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Entanglement has been extensively used to characterize the structure of strongly correlated many-body systems. Most of these analyses focus on either spatial properties of entanglement or its temporal behavior. Negativity, as an entanglement measure, quantifies entanglement between different non-complementary blocks of a many-body system. Here, we consider a combined spatial-temporal analysis of entanglement negativity in a strongly correlated many-body system to characterize complex formation of correlations through non-equilibrium dynamics of such systems. A bond defect is introduced through a local quench at one of the boundaries of a uniform Heisenberg spin chain. Using negativity and entanglement entropy, computed by the time-dependent density matrix renormalization group, we analyze the extension of entanglement in the model as a function of time. We find that an entanglement cloud is formed, detached from the boundary spin and composed of spins with which it is highly entangled. The cloud travels ballistically in the chain until it reaches the other end where it reflects back and the cycle repeats. The revival dynamics exhibits an intriguing contraction (expansion) of the cloud as it moves away from (towards) the boundary spin.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16279'&gt;arXiv:2407.16279&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 23 Jul 2024 08:30:59 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Ground-State Properties of the $t$-$J$ Model for the CuO Double-Chain Structure</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Tatsuya Kaneko, Satoshi Ejima, Koudai Sugimoto, Kazuhiko Kuroki&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We investigate the ground-state properties of a correlated model for the double-chain structure in cuprates. We consider the $t$-$J$ model, in which the nearest-neighbor spin interaction $J_1$ is smaller than the next-nearest-neighbor interaction $J_2$ corresponding to the CuO double-chain structure. We vary $J_1$ from antiferromagnetic to ferromagnetic values and calculate the correlation functions including the superconducting pair correlation function. Employing the density-matrix renormalization group method, we show that the ground state for antiferromagnetic $J_1$ exhibits the hallmarks of the Luther-Emery liquid phase, in which the spin-singlet pair and charge-density-wave correlations exhibit power-law decays against distance, and the spin correlation function decays exponentially. Its signatures are gradually dismissed as $J_1$ approaches the ferromagnetic regime. Our findings suggest that the antiferromagnetic double-chain structure without ferromagnetic bonds is favorable for superconductivity.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16325'&gt;arXiv:2407.16325&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 23 Jul 2024 09:20:48 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

We discuss universal and non-universal features in the resulting Coulomb gas distribution and identify the Wigner surmise and Wigner semicircle explicitly in a teacher-student model and in the (near-)solvable case of the Gaussian restricted Boltzmann machine.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16427'&gt;arXiv:2407.16427&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 23 Jul 2024 12:25:50 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

However, the role of 1-form symmetries in Projected Entangled-Pair States (PEPS), two-dimensional tensor network states, remains largely underexplored. We present a novel framework for understanding 1-form symmetries within tensor networks, specifically focusing on the derivation of algebraic relations for symmetry matrices on the PEPS virtual legs. Our results reveal that 1-form symmetries impose stringent constraints on tensor network representations, leading to distinct anomalous braiding phases carried by symmetry matrices. We demonstrate how these symmetries influence the ground state and tangent space in PEPS, providing new insights into their physical implications for enhancing ground state optimization efficiency and characterizing the 1-form symmetry structure in excited states.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16531'&gt;arXiv:2407.16531&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 23 Jul 2024 14:44:02 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>APD-Invariant Tensor Networks from Matrix Quantum Mechanics</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Alexander Frenkel&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We propose a simple connection between matrix quantum mechanics and tensor networks. This allows us to imbue tensor networks with some interesting additional structure. The geometry of the graph describing the tensor network state is determined dynamically, giving a notion of background independence. The tensor network states have a $U(N)$ invariance, which (a) allows us to consider continuous families of entanglement cuts even with a finite number of tensors and (b) includes a notion of bulk coordinate reparameterization and area-preserving diffeomorphism invariance in the large N limit. These tensor networks also have a natural scale of nonlocality that behaves similarly to a string scale, suggesting a potential toy model for sub-AdS physics. Emergent $U(p)$ gauge fields naturally appear on the tensor network links.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16753'&gt;arXiv:2407.16753&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 23 Jul 2024 18:00:02 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>A New Covariant Entropy Bound from Cauchy Slice Holography</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16769</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Ronak M Soni, Aron C. Wall&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We begin an investigation of a new holographic covariant entropy bound (HCEB) in gravity. This bound arises from Cauchy slice holography, a recently proposed duality between the bulk gravity theory and a `boundary' theory that lives on Cauchy slices. The HCEB is the logarithm of the maximum number of states of this theory that can pass through a given cut $\sigma$ of a Cauchy slice $\Sigma$ ($\sigma$ is thus a codimension-2 surface in the bulk). We show that the bound depends only on the codimension-2 data on $\sigma$, and is thus independent of the choice of slice $\Sigma$. For classical states, the HCEB upper bounds the entanglement between two subregions of the boundary of $\Sigma$. We calculate the bound explicitly in pure three-dimensional GR with negative cosmological constant, where the Cauchy slice theory is the $T \overline{T}$-deformation of the dual CFT. We find that the imaginary energy eigenstates in the spectrum of the deformed theory play a crucial role for obtaining a valid bound in Lorentzian signature. Our bound agrees with the area of a surface at certain marginal and extremal surfaces, but differs elsewhere. In particular, it exceeds the area by an arbitrarily large amount for (anti)trapped surfaces, such as those that lie inside a black hole. Finally, we discuss how these results can be used to write down tensor networks corresponding to arbitrary Cauchy slices.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16769'&gt;arXiv:2407.16769&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 23 Jul 2024 18:03:35 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>The Ground State of the S=1 Antiferromagnetic Heisenberg Chain is Topologically Nontrivial if Gapped</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Hal Tasaki&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Under the widely accepted but unproven assumption that the one-dimensional S=1 antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model has a unique gapped ground state, we prove that the model belongs to a nontrivial symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phase. In other words, we rigorously rule out the possibility that the model has a unique gapped ground state that is topologically trivial. To be precise, we assume that the models on open finite chains with boundary magnetic field have unique ground states with a uniform gap and prove that the ground state of the infinite chain has a nontrivial topological index. This further implies the presence of a gapless edge excitation in the model on the half-infinite chain and the existence of a topological phase transition in the model that interpolates between the Heisenberg chain and the trivial model.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17041'&gt;arXiv:2407.17041&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 24 Jul 2024 07:02:41 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

Rather than viewing them as competing approaches, here we consider how these two methods can work in tandem. We introduce a novel algorithm that combines tensor networks and quantum computation to produce results that are more accurate than what could be achieved by either method used in isolation. Our algorithm is based on multiproduct formulas (MPF) - a technique that linearly combines Trotter product formulas to reduce algorithmic error. Our algorithm uses a quantum computer to calculate the expectation values and tensor networks to calculate the coefficients used in the linear combination. We present a detailed error analysis of the algorithm and demonstrate the full workflow on a one-dimensional quantum simulation problem on $50$ qubits using two IBM quantum computers: $ibm\_torino$ and $ibm\_kyiv$.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17405'&gt;arXiv:2407.17405&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 24 Jul 2024 16:37:35 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

Yao&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Neutral atoms become strongly interacting when their electrons are excited to loosely bound Rydberg states. We investigate the strongly correlated quantum phases of matter that emerge in two-dimensional atom arrays where three Rydberg levels are used to encode an effective spin-1 degree of freedom. Dipolar exchange between such spin-1 Rydberg atoms naturally yields two distinct models: (i) a two-species hardcore boson model, and (ii) upon tuning near a Förster resonance, a dipolar spin-1 XY model. Through extensive, large-scale infinite density matrix renormalization group calculations, we provide a broad roadmap predicting the quantum phases that emerge from these models on a variety of lattice geometries: square, triangular, kagome, and ruby. We identify a wealth of correlated states, including lattice supersolids and simplex phases, all of which can be naturally realized in near-term experiments.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17554'&gt;arXiv:2407.17554&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 24 Jul 2024 18:00:01 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

Ignacio Cirac&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We introduce regular language states, a family of quantum many-body states. They are built from a special class of formal languages, called regular, which has been thoroughly studied in the field of computer science. They can be understood as the superposition of all the words in a regular language and encompass physically relevant states such as the GHZ-, W- or Dicke-states. By leveraging the theory of regular languages, we develop a theoretical framework to describe them. First, we express them in terms of matrix product states, providing efficient criteria to recognize them. We then develop a canonical form which allows us to formulate a fundamental theorem for the equivalence of regular language states, including under local unitary operations. We also exploit the theory of tensor networks to find an efficient criterion to determine when regular languages are shift-invariant.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17641'&gt;arXiv:2407.17641&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 24 Jul 2024 21:09:22 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Quantum landscape tomography for efficient single-gate optimization on quantum computers</title>

Dalla Torre&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Circuit optimization is a fundamental task for practical applications of near-term quantum computers. In this work we address this challenge through the powerful lenses of tensor network theory. Our approach involves the full characterization of the influence of individual gates on the entire circuit, a process we call quantum landscape tomography. We derive the necessary and sufficient requirements of this process and propose two implementations, respectively based on 2-unitary design and Clifford tableaux. The latter implementation strikes a convenient balance between the number of shots and the number of circuits needed for the tomography. Numerical simulations based on a realistic noise model demonstrate the advantage of our approach with respect to both gradient-free and gradient-based methods. Overall, our findings highlight the potential of quantum landscape tomography to enhance circuit optimization in near-term quantum computing applications.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18305'&gt;arXiv:2407.18305&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 25 Jul 2024 18:00:06 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Efficient computational homogenization via tensor train format</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Yuki Sato, Yuto Lewis Terashima, Ruho Kondo&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Real-world physical systems, like composite materials and porous media, exhibit complex heterogeneities and multiscale nature, posing significant computational challenges. Computational homogenization is useful for predicting macroscopic properties from the microscopic material constitution. It involves defining a representative volume element (RVE), solving governing equations, and evaluating its properties such as conductivity and elasticity. Despite its effectiveness, the approach can be computationally expensive. This study proposes a tensor-train (TT)-based asymptotic homogenization method to address these challenges. By deriving boundary value problems at the microscale and expressing them in the TT format, the proposed method estimates material properties efficiently. We demonstrate its validity and effectiveness through numerical experiments applying the proposed method for homogenization of thermal conductivity and elasticity in two- and three-dimensional materials, offering a promising solution for handling the multiscale nature of heterogeneous systems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18870'&gt;arXiv:2407.18870&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 26 Jul 2024 17:04:04 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Absence of gapless Majorana edge modes in few-leg bosonic flux ladders</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18873</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Felix A. Palm, Cécile Repellin, Nathan Goldman, Fabian Grusdt&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The search for Majorana excitations has seen tremendous efforts in recent years, ultimately aiming for their individual controllability in future topological quantum computers. A promising framework to realize such exotic Majorana fermions are topologically ordered non-Abelian phases of matter, such as certain fractional quantum Hall states. Quantum simulators provide unprecedented controllability and versatility to investigate such states, and developing experimentally feasible schemes to realize and identify them is of immediate relevance. Motivated by recent experiments, we consider bosons on coupled chains, subjected to a magnetic flux and experiencing Hubbard repulsion. At magnetic filling factor $\nu=1$, similar systems on cylinders have been found to host the non-Abelian Moore-Read Pfaffian state in the bulk. Here, we address the question whether more realistic few-leg ladders can host this exotic state and its chiral Majorana edge states. To this end, we perform extensive DMRG simulations and determine the central charge of the ground state. While we do not find any evidence of gapless Majorana edge modes in systems of up to six legs, exact diagonalization of small systems reveals evidence for the Pfaffian state in the entanglement structure. By systematically varying the number of legs and monitoring the appearance and disappearance of this signal, our work highlights the importance of finite-size effects for the realization of exotic states in experimentally realistic systems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18873'&gt;arXiv:2407.18873&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 26 Jul 2024 17:06:25 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Effective Modeling of Open Quantum Systems by Low-rank Discretization of Structured Environments</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18880</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Hideaki Takahashi, Raffaele Borrelli&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The accurate description of the interaction of a quantum system with a its environment is a challenging problem ubiquitous across all areas of physics, and lies at the foundation of quantum mechanics theory. Here we pioneer a new strategy to create discrete low-rank models of the system-environment interaction, by exploiting the frequency and time domain information encoded in the fluctuation-dissipation relation connecting the system-bath correlation function and the spectral density. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methodology by combining it with tensor-network methodologies and simulating the quantum dynamics of a complex excitonic systems in a highly structured bosonic environment. The new modeling framework sets the basis for a leap in the analysis of open quantum systems providing controlled accuracy at significantly reduced computational costs, with benefits in all connected research areas.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18880'&gt;arXiv:2407.18880&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 26 Jul 2024 17:27:09 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Chiral polaron formation on the edge of topological quantum matter</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Amit Vashisht, Ivan Amelio, Laurens Vanderstraeten, Georg M. Bruun, Oriana K. Diessel, Nathan Goldman&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Immersing a mobile impurity in a quantum many-body environment can reveal fundamental properties of the background medium, hence providing a powerful probe of quantum matter. This approach is particularly intriguing when considering media with exotic properties, such as strongly-correlated phases and topological states of matter. In this work, we study the dressing of a mobile impurity interacting with a chiral mode, as provided by the edge of topological quantum matter. The resulting ''chiral polaron'' is characterized by an asymmetric spectral function, which reflects the chirality and group velocity of the topological edge mode and the drag experienced by the mobile impurity. We first build our theoretical understanding from an effective one-dimensional chiral model, which captures the hallmark signatures of the chiral polaron. We then demonstrate how this simple picture extends to realistic models of integer and fractional Chern insulator states, by adapting tensor-network methods to polaron spectroscopy. Injecting mobile impurities on the edge of topological quantum matter is shown to be a powerful tool to probe exotic edge properties, particularly suitable for cold-atom experiments.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19093'&gt;arXiv:2407.19093&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 26 Jul 2024 21:18:39 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Younes Javanmard&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We present a quantum algorithm for simulating complex many-body systems and finding their ground states, combining the use of tensor networks and density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) techniques. The algorithm is based on von Neumann's measurement prescription, which serves as a conceptual building block for quantum phase estimation. We describe the implementation and simulation of the algorithm, including the estimation of resources required and the use of matrix product operators (MPOs) to represent the Hamiltonian. We highlight the potential applications of the algorithm in simulating quantum spin systems and electronic structure problems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19348'&gt;arXiv:2407.19348&lt;/a&gt;] Published Sat, 27 Jul 2024 22:39:47 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>HOBOTAN: Efficient Higher Order Binary Optimization Solver with Tensor Networks and PyTorch</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19987</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Shoya Yasuda, Shunsuke Sotobayashi, Yuichiro Minato&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; In this study, we introduce HOBOTAN, a new solver designed for Higher Order Binary Optimization (HOBO). HOBOTAN supports both CPU and GPU, with the GPU version developed based on PyTorch, offering a fast and scalable system. This solver utilizes tensor networks to solve combinatorial optimization problems, employing a HOBO tensor that maps the problem and performs tensor contractions as needed. Additionally, by combining techniques such as batch processing for tensor optimization and binary-based integer encoding, we significantly enhance the efficiency of combinatorial optimization. In the future, the utilization of increased GPU numbers is expected to harness greater computational power, enabling efficient collaboration between multiple GPUs for high scalability. Moreover, HOBOTAN is designed within the framework of quantum computing, thus providing insights for future quantum computer applications. This paper details the design, implementation, performance evaluation, and scalability of HOBOTAN, demonstrating its effectiveness.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19987'&gt;arXiv:2407.19987&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 29 Jul 2024 13:20:11 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Commensurate supersolids and re-entrant transitions in an extended Bose-Hubbard ladder</title>

In contrast to a single-chain, a commensurate supersolid emerges, and based on the Luttinger parameter, we classify them into two types. The latter leads to a reentrant gapless behavior as the onsite interaction is increased while keeping all other parameters intact. A reentrant gapped transition is also found as a function of nearest-neighbor interactions. Further, we show that the string order characterizing the Haldane phase vanishes for a finite inter-chain hopping amplitude, however small it is. Finally, we propose two experimental platforms to observe our findings, using either dipolar atoms or polar molecules and Rydberg admixed atoms.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20107'&gt;arXiv:2407.20107&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 29 Jul 2024 15:34:29 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>An analog of topological entanglement entropy for mixed states</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20500</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Ting-Tung Wang, Menghan Song, Zi Yang Meng, Tarun Grover&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We propose the convex-roof extension of quantum conditional mutual information ("co(QCMI)") as a diagnostic of topological order in a mixed state. We focus primarily on topological states subjected to local decoherence, and employ the Levin-Wen scheme to define co(QCMI), so that for a pure state, co(QCMI) equals topological entanglement entropy (TEE). By construction, co(QCMI) is zero if and only if a mixed state can be decomposed as a convex sum of pure states with zero TEE. We show that co(QCMI) is non-increasing with increasing decoherence when Kraus operators are proportional to the product of onsite unitaries. This implies that unlike a pure state transition between a topologically trivial and a non-trivial phase, the long-range entanglement at a decoherence-induced topological phase transition as quantified by co(QCMI) is less than or equal to that in the proximate topological phase. For the 2d toric code decohered by onsite bit/phase-flip noise, we show that co(QCMI) is non-zero below the error-recovery threshold and zero above it. Relatedly, the decohered state cannot be written as a convex sum of short-range entangled pure states below the threshold. We conjecture and provide evidence that in this example, co(QCMI) equals TEE of a recently introduced pure state. In particular, we develop a tensor-assisted Monte Carlo (TMC) computation method to efficiently evaluate the Rényi TEE for the aforementioned pure state and provide non-trivial consistency checks for our conjecture. We use TMC to also calculate the universal scaling dimension of the anyon-condensation order parameter at this transition.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20500'&gt;arXiv:2407.20500&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 30 Jul 2024 02:26:45 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Magnon Spectra of Cuprates beyond Spin Wave Theory</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Jiahui Bao, Matthias Gohlke, Jeffrey G. Rau, Nic Shannon&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The usual starting point for understanding magnons in cuprate antiferromagnets such as La$_2$CuO$_4$ is a spin model incorporating cyclic exchange, which descends from a one-band Hubbard model, and has parameters taken from fits based on non-interacting spin wave theory. Here we explore whether this provides a reliable description of experiment, using matrix product states (MPS) to calculate magnon spectra beyond spin wave theory. We find that analysis based on low orders of spin wave theory leads to systematic overestimates of exchange parameters, with corresponding errors in estimates of Hubbard $t/U$. Once these are corrected, the ''standard'' model provides a good account of magnon dispersion and lineshape in La$_2$CuO$_4$, but fails to fully capture the continuum observed at high energies. The extension of this analysis to CaCuO$_2$ and Sr$_2$IrO$_4$ is also discussed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20501'&gt;arXiv:2407.20501&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 30 Jul 2024 02:27:47 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Dynamics and Fusion of Majorana Zero Modes in Quantum-dot based Interacting Kitaev Chains</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Bradraj Pandey, Elbio Dagotto&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Motivated by the recent experimental realization of a minimal Kitaev chain in quantum dot systems, we present our theoretical findings on the dynamics and fusion of MZMs at or near the $``$sweet spot" $t_h = \Delta$ (where the fermionic hopping $t_h$ and superconducting coupling $\Delta$ are equal). We investigated the dynamics and fusion of MZMs using time-dependent real-space local density-of-states methods. The movement of Majoranas and the detection of fusion channels are crucial for topological quantum computations. Additionally, we discuss our recent discovery of exotic $``$multi-site" MZMs in $Y$-shaped Kitaev wires, which is important for the potential braiding of Majoranas in $Y$-junctions formed from arrays of quantum dots. Finally, we present results on "non-trivial" fusion using canonical Kitaev wires at the sweet spot.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20783'&gt;arXiv:2407.20783&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 30 Jul 2024 12:41:19 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Scaling of contraction costs for entanglement renormalization algorithms including tensor Trotterization and variational Monte Carlo</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21006</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Thomas Barthel, Qiang Miao&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The multi-scale entanglement renormalization ansatz (MERA) is a hierarchical class of tensor network states motivated by the real-space renormalization group. It is used to simulate strongly correlated quantum many-body systems. For prominent MERA structures in one and two spatial dimensions and different optimization strategies, we determine the optimal scaling of contraction costs as well as corresponding contraction sequences and algorithmic phase diagrams. This is motivated by recent efforts to employ MERA in hybrid quantum-classical algorithms, where the MERA tensors are Trotterized, i.e., chosen as circuits of quantum gates, and observables as well as energy gradients are evaluated by sampling causal-cone states. We investigate whether tensor Trotterization and/or variational Monte Carlo (VMC) sampling can lead to quantum-inspired classical MERA algorithms that perform better than the traditional optimization of full MERA based on the exact evaluation of energy gradients. Algorithmic phase diagrams indicate the best MERA method depending on the scaling of the energy accuracy and the optimal number of Trotter steps with the bond dimension. The results suggest substantial gains due to VMC for two-dimensional systems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21006'&gt;arXiv:2407.21006&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 30 Jul 2024 17:54:15 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Projected Entangled Pair States with flexible geometry</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21140</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Siddhartha Patra, Sukhbinder Singh, Román Orús&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Projected Entangled Pair States (PEPS) are a class of quantum many-body states that generalize Matrix Product States for one-dimensional systems to higher dimensions. In recent years, PEPS have advanced understanding of strongly correlated systems, especially in two dimensions, e.g., quantum spin liquids. Typically described by tensor networks on regular lattices (e.g., square, cubic), PEPS have also been adapted for irregular graphs, however, the computational cost becomes prohibitive for dense graphs with large vertex degrees. In this paper, we present a PEPS algorithm to simulate low-energy states and dynamics defined on arbitrary, fluctuating, and densely connected graphs. We introduce a cut-off, $\kappa \in \mathbb{N}$, to constrain the vertex degree of the PEPS to a set but tunable value, which is enforced in the optimization by applying a simple edge-deletion rule, allowing the geometry of the PEPS to change and adapt dynamically to the system's correlation structure. We benchmark our flexible PEPS algorithm with simulations of classical spin glasses and quantum annealing on densely connected graphs with hundreds of spins, and also study the impact of tuning $\kappa$ when simulating a uniform quantum spin model on a regular (square) lattice. Our work opens the way to apply tensor network algorithms to arbitrary, even fluctuating, background geometries.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21140'&gt;arXiv:2407.21140&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 30 Jul 2024 19:03:52 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Hyperoptimized approximate contraction of tensor networks for rugged-energy-landscape spin glasses on periodic square and cubic lattices</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21287</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Adil A. Gangat, Johnnie Gray&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Obtaining the low-energy configurations of spin glasses that have rugged energy landscapes is of direct relevance to combinatorial optimization and fundamental science. Search-based heuristics have difficulty with this task due to the existence of many local minima that are far from optimal. The work of [M. M. Rams et al., Phys. Rev. E 104, 025308 (2021)] demonstrates an alternative that can bypass this issue for spin glasses with planar or quasi-planar geometry: sampling the Boltzmann distribution via approximate contractions of tensor networks. The computational complexity of this approach is due only to the complexity of contracting the network, and is therefore independent of landscape ruggedness. Here we initiate an investigation of how to take this approach beyond (quasi-)planar geometry by utilizing hyperoptimized approximate contraction of tensor networks [J. Gray and G. K.-L. Chan, Phys. Rev. X 14, 011009 (2024)]. We perform tests on the periodic square- and cubic-lattice, planted-solution Ising spin glasses generated with tile planting [F. Hamze et al., Phys. Rev. E 97, 043303 (2018)] for up to 2304 (square lattice) and 216 (cubic lattice) spins. For a fixed bond dimension, the time complexity is quadratic. With a bond dimension of only four, over the tested system sizes the average relative energy error in the most rugged instance class remains at ~1% (square lattice) or ~10% (cubic lattice) of optimal. In less rugged instances the solution is always optimal for the square lattice and either optimal or within ~1% for the cubic lattice. These results suggest that further development of optimization methods based on tensor-network representations of spin glass partition functions may be fruitful, especially given that such methods are not limited to the Ising (i.e., binary) or two-body (i.e., quadratic) settings.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21287'&gt;arXiv:2407.21287&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 31 Jul 2024 02:21:42 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Non-equilibrium dynamics of charged dual-unitary circuits</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21786</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Alessandro Foligno, Pasquale Calabrese, Bruno Bertini&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The interplay between symmetries and entanglement in out-of-equilibrium quantum systems is currently at the centre of an intense multidisciplinary research effort. Here we introduce a setting where these questions can be characterised exactly by considering dual-unitary circuits with an arbitrary number of $U(1)$ charges. After providing a complete characterisation of these systems we show that one can introduce a class of solvable states, which extends that of generic dual unitary circuits, for which the non-equilibrium dynamics can be solved exactly. In contrast to the known class of solvable states, which relax to the infinite temperature state, these states relax to a family of non-trivial generalised Gibbs ensembles. The relaxation process of these states can be simply described by a linear growth of the entanglement entropy followed by saturation to a non-maximal value but with maximal entanglement velocity. We then move on to consider the dynamics from non-solvable states, combining exact results with the entanglement membrane picture we argue that the entanglement dynamics from these states is qualitatively different from that of the solvable ones. It shows two different growth regimes characterised by two distinct slopes, both corresponding to sub-maximal entanglement velocities. Moreover, we show that non-solvable initial states can give rise to the quantum Mpemba effect, where less symmetric initial states restore the symmetry faster than more symmetric ones.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21786'&gt;arXiv:2407.21786&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 31 Jul 2024 17:57:14 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Non-equilibrium dynamics of symmetry-resolved entanglement and entanglement asymmetry: Exact asymptotics in Rule 54</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Katja Klobas&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Symmetry resolved entanglement and entanglement asymmetry are two measures of quantum correlations sensitive to symmetries of the system. Here we discuss their non-equilibrium dynamics in the Rule 54 cellular automaton, a simple, yet interacting, integrable model. Both quantities can be expressed in terms of the more analytically tractable "charged moments", i.e. traces of powers of a suitably deformed density matrix, via a replica trick. We express them in terms of a tensor network, which we contract in space using a system of local algebraic relations. This gives the asymptotic form for the charged moments, valid in the regime of large but finite time that is shorter than all the relevant subsystem sizes. In this regime the charge moments decay exponentially with the rate given by the leading solution to a cubic equation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21793'&gt;arXiv:2407.21793&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 31 Jul 2024 17:59:50 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

The relative simplicity of this model, embodied by the sparseness of the Hamiltonian matrix, allows for its efficient implementation on quantum computers, and for its approximate solution using variational algorithms such as the variational quantum eigensolver. While these algorithms have been shown to reproduce the qualitative features of the Hubbard model, their quantitative accuracy in terms of producing true ground state energies and other properties, and the dependence of this accuracy on the system size and interaction strength, the choice of variational ansatz, and the degree of spatial inhomogeneity in the model, remains unknown. Here we present a rigorous classical benchmarking study, demonstrating the potential impact of these factors on the accuracy of the variational solution of the Hubbard model on quantum hardware, for systems with up to $32$ qubits. We find that even when using the most accurate wavefunction ans\"{a}tze for the Hubbard model, the error in its ground state energy and wavefunction plateaus for larger lattices, while stronger electronic correlations magnify this issue. Concurrently, spatially inhomogeneous parameters and the presence of off-site Coulomb interactions only have a small effect on the accuracy of the computed ground state energies. Our study highlights the capabilities and limitations of current approaches for solving the Hubbard model on quantum hardware, and we discuss potential future avenues of research.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00836'&gt;arXiv:2408.00836&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 01 Aug 2024 18:00:04 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Constructive Fermionic Matrix Product States for Projected Fermi Sea</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Kangle Li, Yan-Bai Zhang, Hoi Chun Po&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Projected wave functions offer a means for incorporating local correlation effects in gapless electronic phases of matter like metals. Although such wave functions can be readily specified formally, it is challenging to compute their associated physical observables. Tensor network approaches offer a modern numerical method for this task. In this work, we develop and demonstrate a constructive tensor-network approach for obtaining physical quantities, like fermion two-point functions and density-density correlation functions, for one-dimensional projected Fermi sea states. We benchmark our method against exact analytical results for spin-1/2 electrons subjected to the Gutzwiller projection, and then present results on spinless fermions with nearest-neighbor repulsion. For a state with two pairs of Fermi points, we reveal a correlation-tuning of the characteristic wave vector of the charge density modulation in the system.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00858'&gt;arXiv:2408.00858&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 01 Aug 2024 18:11:33 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Tensor Train Low-rank Approximation (TT-LoRA): Democratizing AI with Accelerated LLMs</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01008</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Afia Anjum, Maksim E. Eren, Ismael Boureima, Boian Alexandrov, Manish Bhattarai&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across a wide range of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, such as question-answering, sentiment analysis, text summarization, and machine translation. However, the ever-growing complexity of LLMs demands immense computational resources, hindering the broader research and application of these models. To address this, various parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategies, such as Low-Rank Approximation (LoRA) and Adapters, have been developed. Despite their potential, these methods often face limitations in compressibility. Specifically, LoRA struggles to scale effectively with the increasing number of trainable parameters in modern large scale LLMs. Additionally, Low-Rank Economic Tensor-Train Adaptation (LoRETTA), which utilizes tensor train decomposition, has not yet achieved the level of compression necessary for fine-tuning very large scale models with limited resources. This paper introduces Tensor Train Low-Rank Approximation (TT-LoRA), a novel parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) approach that extends LoRETTA with optimized tensor train (TT) decomposition integration. By eliminating Adapters and traditional LoRA-based structures, TT-LoRA achieves greater model compression without compromising downstream task performance, along with reduced inference latency and computational overhead. We conduct an exhaustive parameter search to establish benchmarks that highlight the trade-off between model compression and performance. Our results demonstrate significant compression of LLMs while maintaining comparable performance to larger models, facilitating their deployment on resource-constraint platforms.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01008'&gt;arXiv:2408.01008&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 02 Aug 2024 04:45:58 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Efficient conversion from fermionic Gaussian states to matrix product states</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01155</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Tong Liu, Ying-Hai Wu, Hong-Hao Tu, Tao Xiang&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Fermionic Gaussian states are eigenstates of quadratic Hamiltonians and are widely used in quantum many-body problems. We propose a highly efficient algorithm that converts fermionic Gaussian states to matrix product states. It can be formulated for finite-size systems without translation invariance, but becomes particularly appealing when applied to infinite systems with translation invariance. If the ground states of a topologically ordered system on infinite cylinders are expressed as matrix product states, then the fixed points of the transfer matrix can be harnessed to filter out the anyon eigenbasis, also known as minimally entangled states. This allows for efficient computation of universal properties, such as the entanglement spectrum and modular matrices. The potential of our method is demonstrated by numerical calculations in two chiral spin liquids that have the same topological orders as the bosonic Laughlin and Moore-Read states, respectively. The anyon eigenbasis for the first one has been worked out before and serves as a useful benchmark. The anyon eigenbasis of the second one is, however, not transparent, and its successful construction provides a nontrivial corroboration of our method.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01155'&gt;arXiv:2408.01155&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 02 Aug 2024 10:15:26 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Strong pairing and symmetric pseudogap metal in double Kondo lattice model: from nickelate superconductor to tetralayer optical lattice</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01493</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Hui Yang, Hanbit Oh, Ya-Hui Zhang&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; In this work, we propose and study a double Kondo lattice model which hosts robust superconductivity. The system consists of two identical Kondo lattice model, each with Kondo coupling $J_K$ within each layer, while the localized spin moments are coupled together via an inter-layer on-site antiferromagnetic spin coupling $J_\perp$. We consider the strong $J_\perp$ limit, wherein the local moments tend to form rung singlets and are thus gapped. However, the Kondo coupling $J_K$ transmits the inter-layer entanglement between the local moments to the itinerant electrons. Consequently, the itinerant electrons experience a strong inter-layer antiferromangetic spin coupling and form strong inter-layer pairing, which is confirmed through numerical simulation in one dimensional system. Experimentally, the $J_K \rightarrow -\infty$ limits of the model describes the recently found bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, while the $J_K&gt;0$ side can be realized in tetralayer optical lattice of cold atoms. Two extreme limits, $J_K \rightarrow -\infty$ and $J_K \rightarrow +\infty$ limit are shown to be simplified to a bilayer type II t-J model and a bilayer one-orbital t-J model, respectively. Thus, our double Kondo lattice model offers a unified framework for nickelate superconductor and tetralayer optical lattice quantum simulator upon changing the sign of $J_K$. We highlight both the qualitative similarity and the quantitative difference in the two sides of $J_K$. Finally, we discuss the possibility of a symmetric Kondo breakdown transition in the model with a symmetric pseudogap metal corresponding to the usual heavy Fermi liquid.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01493'&gt;arXiv:2408.01493&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 02 Aug 2024 18:00:02 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>An Adaptive Tensor-Train Decomposition Approach for Efficient Deep Neural Network Compression</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01534</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Shiyi Luo, Mingshuo Liu, Yifeng Yu, Shangping Ren, Yu Bai&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; In the field of model compression, choosing an appropriate rank for tensor decomposition is pivotal for balancing model compression rate and efficiency. However, this selection, whether done manually or through optimization-based automatic methods, often increases computational complexity. Manual rank selection lacks efficiency and scalability, often requiring extensive trial-and-error, while optimization-based automatic methods significantly increase the computational burden. To address this, we introduce a novel, automatic, and budget-aware rank selection method for efficient model compression, which employs Layer-Wise Imprinting Quantitation (LWIQ). LWIQ quantifies each layer's significance within a neural network by integrating a proxy classifier. This classifier assesses the layer's impact on overall model performance, allowing for a more informed adjustment of tensor rank. Furthermore, our approach includes a scaling factor to cater to varying computational budget constraints. This budget awareness eliminates the need for repetitive rank recalculations for different budget scenarios. Experimental results on the CIFAR-10 dataset show that our LWIQ improved by 63.2% in rank search efficiency, and the accuracy only dropped by 0.86% with 3.2x less model size on the ResNet-56 model as compared to the state-of-the-art proxy-based automatic tensor rank selection method.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01534'&gt;arXiv:2408.01534&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 02 Aug 2024 18:47:11 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>A Model for Topological p-wave Superconducting Wires with Disorder and Interactions</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Frederick Del Pozo, Loïc Herviou, Olesia Dmytruk, Karyn Le Hur&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We present a comprehensive theoretical study of interacting and disordered topological phases of coupled Kitaev wires, which may support further realistic applications of Majorana fermions. We develop a variety of analytical, mathematical and numerical methods for one and two-coupled wires, associated with a topological marker accessible from real-space correlation functions on the wire(s). We verify the stability of the topological superconducting phase and quantify disorder effects close to the quantum phase transitions, e.g. through two-point correlation functions or using a renormalization group (RG) analysis of disorder. We show for the first time that the double critical Ising (DCI) phase -- a fractional Majorana liquid characterized by a pair of half central charges and topological numbers -- is stabilized by strong interactions against disorder which respects the inversion symmetry between the wires (ie. parity conservation on each wire). In the presence of an inter-wire hopping term, the DCI phase turns into a protected topological phase with a bulk gap. We study the localization physics developing along the critical line for weaker interactions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02105'&gt;arXiv:2408.02105&lt;/a&gt;] Published Sun, 04 Aug 2024 18:09:35 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Magnetocaloric Effect of Topological Excitations in Kitaev Magnets</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02566</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Han Li, Enze Lv, Ning Xi, Yuan Gao, Yang Qi, Wei Li, Gang Su&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Traditional magnetic sub-Kelvin cooling relies on the nearly free local moments in hydrate paramagnetic salts, whose utility is hampered by the dilute magnetic ions and low thermal conductivity. Here we propose to use instead fractional excitations inherent to quantum spin liquids (QSLs) as an alternative, which are sensitive to external fields and can induce a very distinctive magnetocaloric effect. With state-of-the-art tensor-network approach, we compute low-temperature properties of Kitaev honeycomb model. For the ferromagnetic case, strong demagnetization cooling effect is observed due to the nearly free $Z_2$ vortices via spin fractionalization, described by a paramagnetic equation of state with a renormalized Curie constant. For the antiferromagnetic Kitaev case, we uncover an intermediate-field gapless QSL phase with very large spin entropy, possibly due to the emergence of spinon Fermi surface. Potential realization of topological excitation cooling in Kitaev materials is also discussed, which may offer a promising pathway to circumvent existing limitations in the paramagnetic hydrates.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02566'&gt;arXiv:2408.02566&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 05 Aug 2024 15:43:02 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Quantum information theory on sparse wavefunctions and applications for Quantum Chemistry</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02631</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Davide Materia, Leonardo Ratini, Leonardo Guidoni&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; In recent years Quantum Computing prominently entered in the field of Computational Chemistry, importing and transforming computational methods and ideas originally developed within other disciplines, such as Physics, Mathematics and Computer Science into algorithms able to estimate quantum properties of atoms and molecules on present and future quantum devices. An important role in this contamination process is attributed to Quantum Information techniques, having the twofold role of contributing to the analysis of electron correlation and entanglements and guiding the construction of wavefunction variational ansatzes for the Variational Quantum Eigensolver technique. This paper introduces the tool SparQ (Sparse Quantum state analysis), designed to efficiently compute fundamental quantum information theory observables on post-Hartree-Fock wavefunctions sparse in their definition space. The core methodology involves mapping fermionic wavefunctions to qubit space using fermionic-to-qubits transformations and leveraging the sparse nature of these wavefunctions to evaluate observables and properties of the wavefunction. The effectiveness of SparQ is validated by analyzing the mutual information matrices of wavefunctions for the water molecule and the total entropy of $\sim 10^2$ qubits describing the benzene molecule. This highlights its capability to handle large-scale quantum systems, limited mainly by the capabilities of quantum chemical methods used to retrieve the wavefunctions. The results indicate that quantum information theoretical analysis, so far limited to traditional tensor network methods and study of transition operators, can be applied to all post-Hartree-Fock wavefunctions, extending their applications to larger and more complex chemical systems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02631'&gt;arXiv:2408.02631&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 05 Aug 2024 16:54:20 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Local ergotropy and its fluctuations across a dissipative quantum phase transition</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02655</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; G. Di Bello, D. Farina, D. Jansen, C. A. Perroni, V. Cataudella, G. De Filippis&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We investigate a two-qubit open Rabi model, focusing on local ergotropy--the maximum extractable work by acting solely on the two qubits--within a parameter regime where a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless dissipative phase transition occurs. First, we aim to define a protocol for charging, storing, and discharging the two-qubit system, interpreted as the working principle of an open quantum battery. Second, we examine the impact of the phase transition on ergotropy and identify potential markers. To achieve these goals, we construct an ad-hoc charging unitary operator, leveraging our knowledge of the ground state near the transition to bring it into a decoherence-free state during storage. Using state-of-the-art numerics based on matrix product state representation, we reveal that high couplings to an external bath approximately double the local ergotropy immediately post-charging. Over time we observe oscillatory behaviors in ergotropy and its fluctuations, which undergo significant changes near the transition, signaling its occurrence. Furthermore, we optimize local ergotropy over time using a physically inspired ansatz, enabling work extraction at a generic time (local ergotropy never reaches zero). Our work proposes a tunable, experimentally realizable protocol for work extraction, leveraging decoherence-free states and phase transitions. Additionally, it sheds light on the complex interaction between local ergotropy and quantum phase transitions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02655'&gt;arXiv:2408.02655&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 05 Aug 2024 17:40:43 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Fock-space delocalization and the emergence of the Porter-Thomas distribution from dual-unitary dynamics</title>

Claeys, Giuseppe De Tomasi&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The chaotic dynamics of quantum many-body systems are expected to quickly randomize any structured initial state, delocalizing it in Fock space. In this work, we study the spreading of an initial product state in Hilbert space under dual-unitary dynamics, captured by the inverse participation ratios and the distribution of overlaps (bit-string probabilities). We consider the self-dual kicked Ising model, a minimal model of many-body quantum chaos which can be seen as either a periodically driven Floquet model or a dual-unitary quantum circuit. Both analytically and numerically, we show that the inverse participation ratios rapidly approach their ergodic values, corresponding to those of Haar random states, and establish the emergence of the Porter-Thomas distribution for the overlap distribution. Importantly, this convergence happens exponentially fast in time, with a time scale that is independent of system size. We inspect the effect of local perturbations that break dual-unitarity and show a slowdown of the spreading in Fock space, indicating that dual-unitary circuits are maximally efficient at preparing random states.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02732'&gt;arXiv:2408.02732&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 05 Aug 2024 18:00:03 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Quantum simulation of dynamical gauge theories in periodically driven Rydberg atom arrays</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02733</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Johannes Feldmeier, Nishad Maskara, Nazlı Uğur Köylüoğlu, Mikhail D. Lukin&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Simulating quantum dynamics of lattice gauge theories (LGTs) is an exciting frontier in quantum science. Programmable quantum simulators based on neutral atom arrays are a promising approach to achieve this goal, since strong Rydberg blockade interactions can be used to naturally create low energy subspaces that can encode local gauge constraints. However, realizing regimes of LGTs where both matter and gauge fields exhibit significant dynamics requires the presence of tunable multi-body interactions such as those associated with ring exchange, which are challenging to realize directly. Here, we develop a method for generating such interactions based on time-periodic driving. Our approach utilizes controlled deviations from time-reversed trajectories, which are accessible in constrained PXP-type models via the application of frequency modulated global pulses. We show that such driving gives rise to a family of effective Hamiltonians with multi-body interactions whose strength is non-perturbative in their respective operator weight. We apply this approach to a two-dimensional U(1) LGT on the Kagome lattice, where we engineer strong six-body magnetic plaquette terms that are tunable relative to the kinetic energy of matter excitations, demonstrating access to previously unexplored dynamical regimes. Potential generalizations and prospects for experimental implementations are discussed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02733'&gt;arXiv:2408.02733&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 05 Aug 2024 18:00:03 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02741</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Nazlı Uğur Köylüoğlu, Nishad Maskara, Johannes Feldmeier, Mikhail D. Lukin&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Neutral atom arrays driven into Rydberg states constitute a promising approach for realizing programmable quantum systems. Enabled by strong interactions associated with Rydberg blockade, they allow for simulation of complex spin models and quantum dynamics. We introduce a new Floquet engineering technique for systems in the blockade regime that provides control over novel forms of interactions and entanglement dynamics in such systems. Our approach is based on time-dependent control of Rydberg laser detuning and leverages perturbations around periodic many-body trajectories as resources for operator spreading. These time-evolved operators are utilized as a basis for engineering interactions in the effective Hamiltonian describing the stroboscopic evolution. As an example, we show how our method can be used to engineer strong spin exchange, consistent with the blockade, in a one-dimensional chain, enabling the exploration of gapless Luttinger liquid phases. In addition, we demonstrate that combining gapless excitations with Rydberg blockade can lead to dynamic generation of large-scale multi-partite entanglement. Experimental feasibility and possible generalizations are discussed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02741'&gt;arXiv:2408.02741&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 05 Aug 2024 18:01:01 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Intertwined Superconductivity and Magnetism from Repulsive Interactions in Kondo Bilayers</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02847</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Clara S. Weber, Dominik Kiese, Dante M. Kennes, Martin Claassen&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; While superconductors are conventionally established by attractive interactions, higher-temperature mechanisms for emergent electronic pairing from strong repulsive electron-electron interactions remain under considerable scrutiny. Here, we establish a strong-coupling mechanism for intertwined superconductivity and magnetic order from purely repulsive interactions in a Kondo-like bilayer system, composed of a two-dimensional Mott insulator coupled to a layer of weakly-interacting itinerant electrons. Combining large scale DMRG and Monte Carlo simulations, we find that superconductivity persists and coexists with magnetism over a wide range of interlayer couplings. We classify the resulting rich phase diagram and find 2-rung antiferromagnetic and 4-rung antiferromagnetic order in one-dimensional systems along with a phase separation regime, while finding that superconductivity coexists with either antiferromagnetic or ferromagnetic order in two dimensions. Remarkably, the model permits a rigorous strong-coupling analysis via localized spins coupled to charge-2e bosons through Kugel-Khomskii interactions, capturing the pairing mechanism in the presence of magnetism due to emergent attractive interactions. Our numerical analysis reveals that pairing remains robust well beyond the strong-coupling regime, establishing a new mechanism for superconductivity in coupled weakly- and strongly-interacting electron systems, relevant for infinite-layer nickelates and superconductivity in moire multilayer heterostructures.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02847'&gt;arXiv:2408.02847&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 05 Aug 2024 22:10:19 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>High-order Tensor-Train Finite Volume Method for Shallow Water Equations</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03483</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Mustafa Engin Danis, Duc P. Truong, Derek DeSantis, Mark Petersen, Kim O. Rasmussen, Boian S. Alexandrov&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; In this paper, we introduce a high-order tensor-train (TT) finite volume method for the Shallow Water Equations (SWEs). We present the implementation of the $3^{rd}$ order Upwind and the $5^{th}$ order Upwind and WENO reconstruction schemes in the TT format. It is shown in detail that the linear upwind schemes can be implemented by directly manipulating the TT cores while the WENO scheme requires the use of TT cross interpolation for the nonlinear reconstruction. In the development of numerical fluxes, we directly compute the flux for the linear SWEs without using TT rounding or cross interpolation. For the nonlinear SWEs where the TT reciprocal of the shallow water layer thickness is needed for fluxes, we develop an approximation algorithm using Taylor series to compute the TT reciprocal. The performance of the TT finite volume solver with linear and nonlinear reconstruction options is investigated under a physically relevant set of validation problems. In all test cases, the TT finite volume method maintains the formal high-order accuracy of the corresponding traditional finite volume method. In terms of speed, the TT solver achieves up to 124x acceleration of the traditional full-tensor scheme.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03483'&gt;arXiv:2408.03483&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 07 Aug 2024 00:01:05 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Solving high-dimensional Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation with functional hierarchical tensor</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04209</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Xun Tang, Nan Sheng, Lexing Ying&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; This work proposes a novel numerical scheme for solving the high-dimensional Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation with a functional hierarchical tensor ansatz. We consider the setting of stochastic control, whereby one applies control to a particle under Brownian motion. In particular, the existence of diffusion presents a new challenge to conventional tensor network methods for deterministic optimal control. To overcome the difficulty, we use a general regression-based formulation where the loss term is the Bellman consistency error combined with a Sobolev-type penalization term. We propose two novel sketching-based subroutines for obtaining the tensor-network approximation to the action-value functions and the value functions, which greatly accelerate the convergence for the subsequent regression phase. We apply the proposed approach successfully to two challenging control problems with Ginzburg-Landau potential in 1D and 2D with 64 variables.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04209'&gt;arXiv:2408.04209&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 08 Aug 2024 04:26:56 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Electric group for knots and links</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04510</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Philipp Korablev&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; In 2014 Andrey Perfiliev introduced the so-called electric invariant for non-oriented knots. This invariant was motivated by using Kirchhoff's laws for the dual graph of the knot diagram. Later, in 2020, Anastasiya Galkina generalised this invariant and defined the electric group for non-oriented knots. Both works were never written and published. In the present paper we describe a simple and general approach to the electric group for oriented knots and links. Each homomorphism from the electric group to an arbitrary finite group can be described by a proper colouring of the diagram. This colouring assigns an element of the group to each crossing of the diagram, and the proper conditions correspond to the areas of the diagram. In the second part of the paper we introduce tensor network invariants for coloured links. The idea of these invariants is very close to quantum invariants for classical links.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04510'&gt;arXiv:2408.04510&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 08 Aug 2024 15:07:55 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Constructing the spin-1 Haldane phase on a qudit quantum processor</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; C. L. Edmunds, E. Rico, I. Arrazola, G. K. Brennen, M. Meth, R. Blatt, M. Ringbauer&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Symmetry-protected topological phases have fundamentally changed our understanding of quantum matter. An archetypal example of such a quantum phase of matter is the Haldane phase, containing the spin-1 Heisenberg chain. The intrinsic quantum nature of such phases, however, often makes it challenging to study them using classical means. Here, we use trapped-ion qutrits to natively engineer spin-1 chains within the Haldane phase. Using a scalable, deterministic procedure to prepare the Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki (AKLT) state within the Haldane phase, we study the topological features of this system on a qudit quantum processor. Notably, we verify the long-range string order of the state, despite its short-range correlations, and observe spin fractionalization of the physical spin-1 particles into effective qubits at the chain edges, a defining feature of this system. The native realization of Haldane physics on a qudit quantum processor and the scalable preparation procedures open the door to the efficient exploration of a wide range of systems beyond spin-1/2&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04702'&gt;arXiv:2408.04702&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 08 Aug 2024 18:00:49 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

Alongside its efficient implementation, this algorithm reduces depolarization noise affections exponentially. We demonstrated energy gap calculations for one-dimensional Hubbard models on IBM superconducting devices using circuits up to 32-system (plus one-ancilla) qubits, a five-fold increase over previous QPE demonstrations, at the 7242 controlled-Z gate level of standard transpilation, utilizing a Q-CTRL error suppression module. Additionally, we propose a technique towards molecular executions using spatial orbital localization and index sorting, verified linear polyene simulations up to 21 qubits. Since QPDE can handle the same objectives as QPE, our algorithm represents a leap forward in quantum computing on real devices.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04946'&gt;arXiv:2408.04946&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 09 Aug 2024 09:01:37 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

This paper presents a broad literature review of state-of-the-art applications of tensor networks and related topics across many research domains including: machine learning, mathematical optimisation, materials science, quantum chemistry and quantum circuit simulation. This review aims to clarify which classes of relevant applications have been proposed for which class of tensor networks, and how these perform compared with other classical or quantum simulation methods. We intend this review to be a high-level tour on tensor network applications which is easy to read by non-experts, focusing on key results and limitations rather than low-level technical details of tensor networks.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05011'&gt;arXiv:2408.05011&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 09 Aug 2024 11:46:47 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Learning symmetry-protected topological order from trapped-ion experiments</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Nicolas Sadoune, Ivan Pogorelov, Claire L. Edmunds, Giuliano Giudici, Giacomo Giudice, Christian D. Marciniak, Martin Ringbauer, Thomas Monz, Lode Pollet&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Classical machine learning has proven remarkably useful in post-processing quantum data, yet typical learning algorithms often require prior training to be effective. In this work, we employ a tensorial kernel support vector machine (TK-SVM) to analyze experimental data produced by trapped-ion quantum computers. This unsupervised method benefits from directly interpretable training parameters, allowing it to identify the non-trivial string-order characterizing symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases. We apply our technique to two examples: a spin-1/2 model and a spin-1 model, featuring the cluster state and the AKLT state as paradigmatic instances of SPT order, respectively. Using matrix product states, we generate a family of quantum circuits that host a trivial phase and an SPT phase, with a sharp phase transition between them. For the spin-1 case, we implement these circuits on two distinct trapped-ion machines based on qubits and qutrits. Our results demonstrate that the TK-SVM method successfully distinguishes the two phases across all noisy experimental datasets, highlighting its robustness and effectiveness in quantum data interpretation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05017'&gt;arXiv:2408.05017&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 09 Aug 2024 12:08:59 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Order by projection in single-band Hubbard model: a DMRG study</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Shuyi Li, Cheng Peng, Yue Yu, B. Sriram Shastry, Chunjing Jia&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; In a Fermi system near or at half-filling, a specific superconducting pairing channel, if not explicitly included in the Hamiltonian, can be boosted by suppressing a competing pairing channel; this is exemplified by the enhancement of extended $s$-wave correlations upon suppressing $s$-wave Cooper pairing. This phenomenon, originally found by the use of generalized uncertainty relations is referred to as \emph{order by projection}. The case of zero on-site Coulomb interaction in the thermodynamic limit, confirms this mechanism through the analytical solution. In this study, we go further and systematically investigate this mechanism for a strongly correlated fermionic Hubbard model, now with finite on-site interaction, on a square lattice with an extended set of hopping parameters. We explore the behaviors of different pairing channels when one of them is suppressed, utilizing density matrix renormalization group calculations. Our findings provide numerical evidence supporting the existence of \emph{order by projection} in the strongly correlated system we studied. We also investigate the effect of the strength of Hubbard $U$, next-nearest neighbor $t'$, hole-doping, as well as finite-size scaling approaching the thermodynamic limit.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05578'&gt;arXiv:2408.05578&lt;/a&gt;] Published Sat, 10 Aug 2024 15:10:38 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Ferromagnetism Mechanism in a Geometrically Frustrated Triangular Lattice</title>

Chen, Zheng Zhu&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We study the emergent itinerant ferromagnetism and propose its underlying mechanism in the geometrically frustrated triangular lattice. Based on large-scale density matrix renormalization group simulations and unrestricted Hartree-Fock mean-field analysis, we identify itinerant ferromagnetic phases in the intermediate-$U$ Hubbard model with finite doping and reveal the kinetic mechanisms assisted by geometric frustration. Notably, we find that the doublon-singlon exchange process among other microscopic charge hoppings solely drives the fully polarized ferromagnetism for geometrically frustrated triangular lattice. Additionally, we establish the whole magnetic phase diagram and illustrate itinerant ferromagnetism within a finite range of electron doping for finite on-site Coulomb repulsion. The comparison of local spin correlations with recent cold-atom experiments is also discussed. Our work enhances the understanding of ferromagnetism mechanisms at intermediate coupling strength and finite doping concentrations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05971'&gt;arXiv:2408.05971&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 12 Aug 2024 08:01:18 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Symmetry topological field theory and non-abelian Kramers-Wannier dualities of generalised Ising models</title>

After providing a general framework for explicitly constructing such realisations, we specialise to non-abelian generalisations of the Ising model and consider two operations: gauging an arbitrary subsymmetry and performing Fourier transforms of the local weights encoding the dynamics of the theory. These are carried out both in a traditional way and in terms of the three-dimensional topological quantum field theory. Whenever the whole symmetry is gauged, combining both operations recovers the non-abelian Kramers-Wannier duals \`a la Freed and Teleman of the generalised Ising models. Moreover, we discuss the interplay between renormalisation group fixed points of gapped symmetric phases and these generalised Kramers-Wannier dualities.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06074'&gt;arXiv:2408.06074&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 12 Aug 2024 11:48:46 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Overcoming the Zero-Rate Hashing Bound with Holographic Quantum Error Correction</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06232</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Junyu Fan, Matthew Steinberg, Alexander Jahn, Chunjun Cao, Sebastian Feld&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; A crucial insight for practical quantum error correction is that different types of errors, such as single-qubit Pauli operators, typically occur with different probabilities. Finding an optimal quantum code under such biased noise is a challenging problem, related to finding the (generally unknown) maximum capacity of the corresponding noisy channel. A benchmark for this capacity is given by the hashing bound, describing the performance of random stabilizer codes, which leads to the challenge of finding codes that reach or exceed this bound while also being efficiently decodable. In this work, we show that asymptotically zero-rate holographic codes, built from hyperbolic tensor networks that model holographic bulk/boundary dualities, fulfill both conditions. Of the five holographic code models considered, all are found to reach the hashing bound in some bias regime and one, the holographic surface-code fragment, appears to even exceed the capacity of previously known codes in the 2-Pauli-dominated noise regime. In addition, we consider Clifford deformations that allow all considered codes to reach the hashing bound for 1-Pauli-dominated noise as well. Our results thus establish that holographic codes, which were previously shown to possess efficient tensor-network decoders, also exhibit competitive thresholds under biased noise.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06232'&gt;arXiv:2408.06232&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 12 Aug 2024 15:35:03 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Entanglement and the density matrix renormalisation group in the generalised Landau paradigm</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06334</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Laurens Lootens, Clement Delcamp, Frank Verstraete&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The fields of entanglement theory and tensor networks have recently emerged as central tools for characterising quantum phases of matter. In this article, we determine the entanglement structure of ground states of gapped symmetric quantum lattice models, and use this to obtain the most efficient tensor network representation of those ground states. We do this by showing that degeneracies in the entanglement spectrum arise through a duality transformation of the original model to the unique dual model where the entire dual (generalised) symmetry is spontaneously broken and subsequently no degeneracies are present. Physically, this duality transformation amounts to a (twisted) gauging of the unbroken symmetry in the original ground state. This result has strong implications for the complexity of simulating many-body systems using variational tensor network methods. For every phase in the phase diagram, the dual representation of the ground state that completely breaks the symmetry minimises both the entanglement entropy and the required number of variational parameters. We demonstrate the applicability of this idea by developing a generalised density matrix renormalisation group algorithm that works on (dual) constrained Hilbert spaces, and quantify the computational gains obtained over traditional tensor network methods in a perturbed Heisenberg model. Our work testifies to the usefulness of generalised non-invertible symmetries and their formal category theoretic description for the practical simulation of strongly correlated systems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06334'&gt;arXiv:2408.06334&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 12 Aug 2024 17:51:00 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Guy Segall, Snir Gazit, Daniel Podolsky&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We introduce a numerical method to study critical properties near classical and quantum phase transitions. Our method applies ideas of the Tensor Renormalization Group to obtain an improved action which is used to extract critical properties by performing Monte Carlo simulations on relatively small system sizes. We demonstrate this method on the XY model in three dimensions. Our method may provide a framework with which to efficiently study universal properties in a large class of phase transitions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06414'&gt;arXiv:2408.06414&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 12 Aug 2024 18:00:03 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Adaptive variational quantum dynamics simulations with compressed circuits and fewer measurements</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06590</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Feng Zhang, Cai-Zhuang Wang, Thomas Iadecola, Peter P. Orth, Yong-Xin Yao&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The adaptive variational quantum dynamics simulation (AVQDS) method performs real-time evolution of quantum states using automatically generated parameterized quantum circuits that often contain substantially fewer gates than Trotter circuits. Here we report an improved version of the method, which we call AVQDS(T), by porting the Tiling Efficient Trial Circuits with Rotations Implemented Simultaneously (TETRIS) technique. The algorithm adaptively adds layers of disjoint unitary gates to the ansatz circuit so as to keep the McLachlan distance, a measure of the accuracy of the variational dynamics, below a fixed threshold. We perform benchmark noiseless AVQDS(T) simulations of quench dynamics in local spin models demonstrating that the TETRIS technique significantly reduces the circuit depth and two-qubit gate count. We also show a method based on eigenvalue truncation to solve the linear equations of motion for the variational parameters with enhanced noise resilience. Finally, we propose a way to substantially alleviate the measurement overhead of AVQDS(T) while maintaining high accuracy by synergistically integrating quantum circuit calculations on quantum processing units with classical calculations using, e.g., tensor networks to evaluate the quantum geometric tensor. We showcase that this approach enables AVQDS(T) to deliver more accurate results than simulations using a fixed ansatz of comparable final depth for a significant time duration with fewer quantum resources.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06590'&gt;arXiv:2408.06590&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 13 Aug 2024 02:56:43 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>DMRG Analysis of Magnetic Order in the Zigzag Edges of Hexagonal CrN Nanoribbons</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06754</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Michał Kupczyński, Jarosław Pawłowski, Aybey Mogulkoc, Mohsen Modarresi&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We investigate the finite temperature magnetic order at the edges of hexagonal CrN nanoribbons by using the density-functional theory combined with the density-matrix renormalization group method. Moreover, the spin-dependent transport in nanoribbons is calculated within the semi-classical Boltzmann transport theory. We find out that the zigzag edges have lower energy with respect to armchair edges. The zigzag edge of CrN nanoribbon shows half metallic electronic character which is the same as for the 2D monolayer. The localized electronic states on the zigzag edges reduce the electronic band gap energy for spin down electrons. The ab-initio electronic results are mapped into an effective 1D Heisenberg spin model up to the next nearest neighbor exchange interaction term. For zigzag ribbons, the nearest neighbor and next nearest neighbor magnetic exchange are around $10$ to $12$, and $-2$ to $0$~meV/Cr atom, respectively. The finite spin correlation length in 1D nanoribbons drops sharply to zero with temperature. The absence of long range spin correlations at the edges is a practical drawback for future room temperature 2D spintronic devices. The maximally localized Wannier functions are used for band interpolation and spin-dependent transport calculations by using the semi-classical Boltzmann equation. We show that zigzag edges of CrN are perfect spin filter under both electron and hole doping.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06754'&gt;arXiv:2408.06754&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 13 Aug 2024 09:26:38 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Optimal quantum state tomography with local informationally complete measurements</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07115</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Casey Jameson, Zhen Qin, Alireza Goldar, Michael B. Wakin, Zhihui Zhu, Zhexuan Gong&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Quantum state tomography (QST) remains the gold standard for benchmarking and verification of near-term quantum devices. While QST for a generic quantum many-body state requires an exponentially large amount of resources, most physical quantum states are structured and can often be represented by a much smaller number of parameters, making efficient QST potentially possible. A prominent example is a matrix product state (MPS) or a matrix product density operator (MPDO), which is believed to represent most physical states generated by one-dimensional (1D) quantum devices. We study whether a general MPS/MPDO state can be recovered with bounded errors using only a number of state copies polynomial in the number of qubits, which is necessary for efficient QST. To make this question practically interesting, we assume only local measurements of qubits directly on the target state. By using a local symmetric informationally complete positive operator-valued measurement (SIC-POVM), we provide a positive answer to the above question for a variety of common many-body quantum states, including typical short-range entangled states, random MPS/MPDO states, and thermal states of one-dimensional Hamiltonians. In addition, we also provide an affirmative no answer for certain long-range entangled states such as a family of generalized GHZ states, but with the exception of target states that are known to have real-valued wavefunctions. Our answers are supported by a near-perfect agreement between an efficient calculation of the Cramer-Rao bound that rigorously bounds the sample complexity and numerical optimization results using a machine learning assisted maximal likelihood estimation (MLE) algorithm. This agreement also leads to an optimal QST protocol using local SIC-POVM that can be practically implemented on current quantum hardware and is highly efficient for most 1D physical states.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07115'&gt;arXiv:2408.07115&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 13 Aug 2024 17:58:02 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Efficient simulation of inhomogeneously correlated systems using block interaction product states</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Yifan Cheng, Zhaoxuan Xie, Xiaoyu Xie, Haibo Ma&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The strength of DMRG lies in its treatment of identical sites that are energetically degenerate and spatially similar. However, this becomes a drawback when applied to quantum chemistry calculations for large systems, as entangled orbitals often span broad ranges in energy and space, with notably inhomogeneous interactions. In this study, we propose addressing strong intra-fragment and weak inter-fragment correlations separately using a multi-configurational block interaction product state (BIPS) framework. The strong correlation is captured in electronic states on fragments, considering entanglement between fragments and their environments. This method has been tested in various chemical systems and shows high accuracy and efficiency in addressing inhomogeneous effects in quantum chemistry.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07965'&gt;arXiv:2408.07965&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 15 Aug 2024 06:25:56 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Left-left-right-right magnetic order in spin-1/2 Kitaev-Heisenberg chain</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07968</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Wang Yang, Chao Xu, Shicheng Ma, Alberto Nocera, Ian Affleck&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; In this work, we perform a combination of analytical and numerical studies on the phase diagram of the spin-1/2 Kitaev-Heisenberg chain in the region of negative Kitaev and positive Heisenberg couplings. Apart from the antiferromagnetic phase, we find a magnetically ordered phase with left-left-right-right order and a gapless phase with central charge value $c=1$, resolving the existing contradictory results in literature regarding this parameter region. In particular, the origin of the left-left-right-right order is clarified based on a perturbative Luttinger liquid analysis. The left-left-right-right phase is further shown to persist in the Kitaev-Heisenberg-Gamma model when a small nonzero Gamma interaction is introduced. Using a coupled-chain method, we also demonstrate that the one-dimensional (1D) left-left-right-right order gives a quasi-1D explanation for the 2D stripy order of the same model on the honeycomb lattice.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07968'&gt;arXiv:2408.07968&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 15 Aug 2024 06:28:08 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Integrable RG Flows on Topological Defect Lines in 2D Conformal Field Theories</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08241</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Thiago Silva Tavares, Madhav Sinha, Linnea Grans-Samuelsson, Ananda Roy, Hubert Saleur&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Topological defect lines (TDLs) in two-dimensional conformal field theories (CFTs) are standard examples of generalized symmetries in quantum field theory. Integrable lattice incarnations of these TDLs, such as those provided by spin/anyonic chains, provide a crucial playground to investigate their properties, both analytically and numerically. Here, a family of parameter-dependent integrable lattice models is presented, which realize different TDLs in a given CFT as the parameter is varied. These models are based on the general quantum-inverse scattering construction, and involve inhomogeneities of the spectral parameter. Both defect hamiltonians and (defect) line operators are obtained in closed form. By varying the inhomogeneities, renormalization group flows between different TDLs (such as the Verlinde lines associated with the Virasoro primaries $(1,s)$ and $(s,1)$ in diagonal minimal CFTs) are then studied using different aspects of the Bethe-ansatz as well as ab-initio numerical techniques. Relationships with the anisotropic Kondo model as well as its non-Hermitian version are briefly discussed&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08241'&gt;arXiv:2408.08241&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 15 Aug 2024 16:08:27 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Probing hydrodynamic crossovers with dissipation-assisted operator evolution</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08249</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; N. S. Srivatsa, Oliver Lunt, Tibor Rakovszky, Curt von Keyserlingk&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Using artificial dissipation to tame entanglement growth, we chart the emergence of diffusion in a generic interacting lattice model for varying U(1) charge densities. We follow the crossover from ballistic to diffusive transport above a scale set by the scattering length, finding the intuitive result that the diffusion constant scales as $D \propto 1/\rho$ at low densities $\rho$. Our numerical approach generalizes the Dissipation-Assisted Operator Evolution (DAOE) algorithm: in the spirit of the BBGKY hierarchy, we effectively approximate non-local operators by their ensemble averages, rather than discarding them entirely. This greatly reduces the operator entanglement entropy, while still giving accurate predictions for diffusion constants across all density scales. We further construct a minimal model for the transport crossover, yielding charge correlation functions which agree well with our numerical data. Our results clarify the dominant contributions to hydrodynamic correlation functions of conserved densities, and serve as a guide for generalizations to low temperature transport.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08249'&gt;arXiv:2408.08249&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 15 Aug 2024 16:39:10 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Gapless spin excitations in nanographene-based antiferromagnetic spin-1/2 Heisenberg chains</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10045</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Chenxiao Zhao, Lin Yang, João C. G. Henriques, Mar Ferri-Cortés, Gonçalo Catarina, Carlo A. Pignedoli, Ji Ma, Xinliang Feng, Pascal Ruffieux, Joaquín Fernández-Rossier, Roman Fasel&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Haldane's seminal work established two fundamentally different types of excitation spectra for antiferromagnetic Heisenberg quantum spin chains: gapped excitations in integer-spin chains and gapless excitations in half-integer-spin chains. In finite-length half-integer spin chains, quantization, however, induces a gap in the excitation spectrum, with the upper bound given by the Lieb-Schulz-Mattis (LSM) theorem. Here, we investigate the length-dependent excitations in spin-1/2 Heisenberg chains obtained by covalently linking olympicenes--Olympic rings shaped nanographenes carrying spin-1/2--into one-dimensional chains. The large exchange interaction (J~38 mV) between olympicenes and the negligible magnetic anisotropy in these nanographenes make them an ideal platform for studying quantum spin excitations, which we directly measure using inelastic electron tunneling spectroscopy. We observe a power-law decay of the lowest excitation energy with increasing chain length L, remaining below the LSM boundary. In a long chain with L = 50, a nearly V-shaped excitation continuum is observed, reinforcing the system's gapless nature in the thermodynamic limit. Finally, we visualize the standing wave of a single spinon confined in odd-numbered chains using low-bias current maps. Our results provide compelling evidence for the realization of a one-dimensional analog of a gapless spin liquid.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10045'&gt;arXiv:2408.10045&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 19 Aug 2024 14:36:33 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Rotations, Negative Eigenvalues, and Newton Method in Tensor Network Renormalization Group</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10312</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Nikolay Ebel, Tom Kennedy, Slava Rychkov&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; In the tensor network approach to statistical physics, properties of the critical point of a 2D lattice model are encoded by a four-legged tensor which is a fixed point of an RG map. The traditional way to find the fixed point tensor consists in iterating the RG map after having tuned the temperature to criticality. Here we develop a different and more direct technique, which solves the fixed point equation via the Newton method. This is challenging due to the existence of marginal deformations -- linear transformations of the coordinate frame, which parametrize a two-dimensional family of fixed points. We address this challenge by including a 90 degree rotation into the RG map. This flips the sign of the problematic marginal eigenvalues, rendering the fixed point isolated and accessible via the Newton method. We demonstrate the power of this technique via explicit computations for the 2D Ising and 3-state Potts models. Using the Gilt-TNR algorithm at bond dimension $\chi=30$, we find the fixed point tensors with $10^{-9}$ accuracy, much higher than what was previously achieved.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10312'&gt;arXiv:2408.10312&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 19 Aug 2024 18:00:02 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Universal Freezing Transitions of Dipole-Conserving Chains</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10321</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Jonathan Classen-Howes, Riccardo Senese, Abhishodh Prakash&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We demonstrate the existence of a universal phase diagram of quantum chains with range-$k$ interactions subject to the conservation of a total charge and its dipole moment. These systems exhibit "freezing" transitions between strongly and weakly Hilbert-space-fragmented phases as the charge filling $\nu$ is varied. We show that these continuous phase transitions occur at a critical charge filling of $\nu_c=(k-2)^{-1}$ independently of the on-site Hilbert space dimension $d$. To this end, we analytically prove that, for any $d$, any state with $\nu&lt;\nu_c$ hosts a finite density of sites belonging to "blockages", which we define as subregions of the chain across which transport of charge and dipole moment cannot occur. Some blockages arise from sequences of frozen sites, i.e. sites with an unchanging on-site charge, while others do not involve frozen sites at all. We prove that the presence of blockages implies strong fragmentation of typical symmetry sectors into Krylov subspaces, each of which forms an exponentially vanishing fraction of the total sector. By studying the distribution of blockages we analytically characterise how typical states are subdivided into dynamically disconnected local "active bubbles", and prove that typical eigenstates at these charge fillings exhibit area-law entanglement entropy, while there exist rare eigenstates featuring non-area-law scaling. We also numerically show that for $\nu&gt;\nu_c$ and arbitrary $d$, typical symmetry sectors are weakly fragmented, with their dominant Krylov sectors constituted of states that are free of blockages. We analytically derive some critical exponents characterising the transition and numerically determine the density of blockages at $\nu=\nu_c$, with clear implications for transport at the critical point. Finally, we investigate the properties of special-case models for which no phase transitions occur.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10321'&gt;arXiv:2408.10321&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 19 Aug 2024 18:00:06 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

The key idea is dynamically optimizing the tree structure that minimizes the bond mutual information. The proposed method offers enhanced performance and uncovers hidden relational structures in the target data. We illustrate potential practical applications with four examples: (i) random patterns, (ii) QMNIST handwritten digits, (iii) Bayesian networks, and (iv) the pattern of stock price fluctuation pattern in S&amp;P500. In (i) and (ii), the strongly correlated variables were concentrated near the center of the network; in (iii), the causality pattern was identified; and in (iv), a structure corresponding to the eleven sectors emerged.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10669'&gt;arXiv:2408.10669&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 20 Aug 2024 09:11:38 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Half Landau-Zener ramp to a quantum phase transition in a dissipative single spin sodel</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Sei Suzuki&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We study the dynamics of a single spin coupled to a bosonic bath at zero temperature driven by a ramp of the bias field. A single spin coupled to a bosonic sub-Ohmic bath exhibits a quantum phase transition at a certain strength of spin-boson coupling. When the bias field is ramped from a large value to zero at this critical coupling strength, the system initialized at the ground state ends up with a finite magnetization due to the critical slowing down near the transition. On the basis of the pulse-impulse approximation, we derive a scaling law between the residual magnetization and the ramp speed. The obtained scaling relation is examined using a numerical simulation based on the tensor network. The data are in favor of the scaling law to hold. We discuss the demonstration of our theoretical results by means of quantum simulation using the quantum annealer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10869'&gt;arXiv:2408.10869&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 20 Aug 2024 13:58:36 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

In this work, we investigate the spin-$3/2$ chain with nearest-neighbor $J_1$, next-nearest-neighbor $J_2$, and uniaxial single-ion anisotropy $D$ terms in the absence of a magnetic field. For positive values of $J_2/J_1$ and $D/J_1$, we find seven different phases in a rich phase diagram. Without frustration $J_2=0$, a gapless Luttinger liquid phase remains stable for all $D&gt;0$. As $J_2$ increases, we observe three phases with distinct dimerized valence bond orders, which show an intricate competition with vector chiral order and incommensurate correlations. For large $J_2$, regions of phase coexistence between the dimerized and vector chiral orders emerge. We present large-scale numerical data for the determination of transition lines, order parameters, and the nature of the phase transitions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11394'&gt;arXiv:2408.11394&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 21 Aug 2024 07:41:56 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

To fully account for quantum effects, we employ numerical simulations based on the density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) and - in the regime of strong boson-boson interactions - the mapping to weakly interacting fermions. A mean-field description of the Bose polaron based on coupled Gross-Pitaevski -- Schrödinger equations predicts the existence of a self-localized polaron. We here show that such a solution does not exist and is an artifact of the underlying decoupling approximation. To this end we consider a mobile impurity in a box potential. Our work demonstrates that correlations between the impurity position and the bosons are important even in the limit where mean-field approaches are expected to work well. Furthermore we derive analytical approximations for the energy of a single polaron formed by a heavy impurity for arbitrary interaction strengths and large but finite boson-boson couplings which accurately reproduce DMRG results. This demonstrates that the polaron problem of a heavy impurity in a 1D Bose gas can be accurately approximated by a proper mean-field description plus a linearized treatment of quantum fluctuations for arbitrary boson-boson and impurity-boson couplings. Finally we determine the polaron-polaron interaction potential $V(r)$ in Born-Oppenheimer approximation for small and intermediate distances $r$, which in the Tonks gas limit is oscillatory due to Friedel oscillations in the Bose gas.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11549'&gt;arXiv:2408.11549&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 21 Aug 2024 11:56:17 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Phase diagram of a spin-1/2 Heisenberg ladder with a chirality-chirality interaction</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11731</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Mateo Fontaine, Shunsuke Furukawa&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; A spin-1/2 Heisenberg model with a chirality-chirality interaction (CCI) on a two-leg ladder provides a minimal setup to explore an interplay between spin and chirality degrees of freedom. This model is potentially relevant for understanding the effects of a four-spin ring exchange and a phonon-mediated interaction on a ladder. By applying the Abelian bosonization and two types of spin-chirality duality, we derive a comprehensive ground-state phase diagram that includes previously unexplored cases of a ferromagnetic rung exchange $J_\perp&lt;0$ or a negative CCI $K_{\rm ch}&lt;0$. The phase diagram consists of the rung singlet (RS) phase, the Haldane phase, and three non-magnetic ordered phases. Moreover, the RS and Haldane phases consist of several regions with different dominant correlations in terms of spin, dimer, or chirality. We perform numerical simulations to confirm the predicted phase structure and critical properties.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11731'&gt;arXiv:2408.11731&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 21 Aug 2024 15:56:17 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Competing quantum effects in spin crossover chains: spin-orbit coupling, magnetic exchange, and elastic interactions</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12043</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Finnian Rist, Henry L. Nourse, Ben J. Powell&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We derive and study a model of square planar, d8 spin crossover materials that treats elastic, magnetic and spin-orbit interactions on an equal footing. For 1D chains density matrix renormalization group calculations show that the competition between these interactions leads to six different phases. For weak spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and large antiferromagnetic interactions we find a symmetry protected topological (SPT) Haldane phase. This is equivalent to the Haldane-large-D phase transition driven by single ion anisotropy(D) in the spin-one Heisenberg model. For strong SOC the Sz=+-1 HS states are high-energy excitations. Thus, the system can be understood as a transverse field Ising model with the SOC playing the role of the transverse field. Consistent with this, we find a quantum phase transition between the THS phase and a quantum disordered (QD) phase. However, if the magnetic coupling is non-zero or the HS and LS states of a single molecule are non-degenerate the Z2 (Ising) symmetry is broken and the phase transition becomes a crossover. Thus, the QD phase and the THS phases are adiabatically connected, as, equivalently, are the large-D phase of the spin-one Heisenberg model and the quantum disordered phase of the transverse field Ising model. We also find a ferroelastic LS phase, and antierroelastic phase, with alternating HS and LS complexes, and a dimer phase, which results from the competition between antiferromagnetic and antiferroelastic interactions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12043'&gt;arXiv:2408.12043&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 22 Aug 2024 00:05:45 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>A strange five vertex model and multispecies ASEP on a ring</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12092</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Atsuo Kuniba, Masato Okado, Travis Scrimshaw&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We revisit the problem of constructing the stationary states of the multispecies asymmetric simple exclusion process on a one-dimensional periodic lattice. Central to our approach is a quantum oscillator weighted five vertex model which features a strange weight conservation distinct from the conventional one. Our results clarify the interrelations among several known results and refine their derivations. For instance, the stationary probability derived from the multiline queue construction by Martin (2020) and Corteel--Mandelshtam--Williams (2022) is identified with the partition function of a three-dimensional system. The matrix product operators by Prolhac--Evans--Mallick (2009) acquire a natural diagrammatic interpretation as corner transfer matrices (CTM). The origin of their recursive tensor structure, as questioned by Aggarwal--Nicoletti--Petrov (2023), is revealed through the CTM diagrams. Finally, the derivation of the Zamolodchikov--Faddeev algebra by Cantini--de Gier--Wheeler (2015) is made intrinsic by elucidating its precise connection to a solution to the Yang--Baxter equation originating from quantum group representations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12092'&gt;arXiv:2408.12092&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 22 Aug 2024 03:01:36 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Quantum Circuit Optimization using Differentiable Programming of Tensor Network States</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12583</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; David Rogerson, Ananda Roy&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Efficient quantum circuit optimization schemes are central to quantum simulation of strongly interacting quantum many body systems. Here, we present an optimization algorithm which combines machine learning techniques and tensor network methods. The said algorithm runs on classical hardware and finds shallow, accurate quantum circuits by minimizing scalar cost functions. The gradients relevant for the optimization process are computed using the reverse mode automatic differentiation technique implemented on top of the time-evolved block decimation algorithm for matrix product states. A variation of the ADAM optimizer is utilized to perform a gradient descent on the manifolds of charge conserving unitary operators to find the optimal quantum circuit. The efficacy of this approach is demonstrated by finding the ground states of spin chain Hamiltonians for the Ising, three-state Potts and the massive Schwinger models for system sizes up to L=100. The first ten excited states of these models are also obtained for system sizes L=24. All circuits achieve high state fidelities within reasonable CPU time and modest memory requirements.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12583'&gt;arXiv:2408.12583&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 22 Aug 2024 17:48:53 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Fingerprints of supersymmetric spin and charge dynamics observed by inelastic neutron scattering</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12626</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Björn Wehinger, Franco T. Lisandrini, Noam Kestin, Pierre Bouillot, Simon Ward, Benedikt Thielemann, Robert Bewley, Martin Boehm, Daniel Biner, Karl W. Krämer, Bruce Normand, Thierry Giamarchi, Corinna Kollath, Andreas M. Läuchli, Christian Rüegg&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Supersymmetry is an algebraic property of a quantum Hamiltonian that, by giving every boson a fermionic superpartner and vice versa, may underpin physics beyond the Standard Model. Fractional bosonic and fermionic quasiparticles are familiar in condensed matter, as in the spin and charge excitations of the $t$-$J$ model describing electron dynamics in one-dimensional materials, but this type of symmetry is almost unknown. However, the triplet excitations of a quantum spin ladder in an applied magnetic field provide a supersymmetric analogue of the $t$-$J$ chain. Here we perform neutron spectroscopy on the spin-ladder compounds (C$_5$D$_{12}$N)$_2$CuBr$_4$ and (C$_5$D$_{12}$N)$_2$CuCl$_4$ over a range of applied fields and temperatures, and apply matrix-product-state methods to the ladder and equivalent chain models. From the momentum-resolved dynamics of a single charge-like excitation in a bath of fractional spins, we find essential differences in thermal broadening between the supersymmetric and non-supersymmetric sectors. The persistence of a strict zone-centre pole at all temperatures constitutes an observable consequence of supersymmetry that marks the beginning of supersymmetric studies in experimental condensed matter.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12626'&gt;arXiv:2408.12626&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 19 Aug 2024 15:56:41 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

Sandvik&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We study the Heisenberg $S=1/2$ chain with random ferro- and antiferromagnetic couplings using quantum Monte Carlo simulations at ultra-low temperatures, converging to the ground state. Finite-size scaling of correlation functions and excitation gaps demonstrate an exotic critical state in qualitative agreement with previous strong-disorder renormalization group calculations but with scaling exponents depending on the coupling distribution. We find dual scaling regimes of the transverse correlations versus the distance, with an $L$ independent form $C(r)=r^{-\mu}$ for $r \ll L$ and $C(r,L)=L^{-\eta}f(r/L)$ for $r/L &gt; 0$, where $\mu &gt; \eta$ and the scaling function is delivered by our analysis. These results are at variance with previous spin-wave and density-matrix renormalization group calculations, thus highlighting the power of unbiased quantum Monte Carlo simulations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12911'&gt;arXiv:2408.12911&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 23 Aug 2024 08:38:11 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Vision Transformer Neural Quantum States for Impurity Models</title>

We employ an adapted Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture to model quantum impurity models, optimizing it with a subspace expansion scheme that surpasses conventional variational Monte Carlo in both accuracy and efficiency. Benchmarks against matrix product states in single- and three-orbital Anderson impurity models show that these ViT-based neural quantum states achieve comparable or superior accuracy with significantly fewer variational parameters. We further extend our approach to compute dynamical quantities by constructing a restricted excitation space that effectively captures relevant physical processes, yielding accurate core-level X-ray absorption spectra. These findings highlight the potential of ViT-based neural quantum states for accurate and efficient modeling of quantum impurity models.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13050'&gt;arXiv:2408.13050&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 23 Aug 2024 13:16:08 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Functional Tensor Decompositions for Physics-Informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13101</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Sai Karthikeya Vemuri, Tim Büchner, Julia Niebling, Joachim Denzler&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have shown continuous and increasing promise in approximating partial differential equations (PDEs), although they remain constrained by the curse of dimensionality. In this paper, we propose a generalized PINN version of the classical variable separable method. To do this, we first show that, using the universal approximation theorem, a multivariate function can be approximated by the outer product of neural networks, whose inputs are separated variables. We leverage tensor decomposition forms to separate the variables in a PINN setting. By employing Canonic Polyadic (CP), Tensor-Train (TT), and Tucker decomposition forms within the PINN framework, we create robust architectures for learning multivariate functions from separate neural networks connected by outer products. Our methodology significantly enhances the performance of PINNs, as evidenced by improved results on complex high-dimensional PDEs, including the 3d Helmholtz and 5d Poisson equations, among others. This research underscores the potential of tensor decomposition-based variably separated PINNs to surpass the state-of-the-art, offering a compelling solution to the dimensionality challenge in PDE approximation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13101'&gt;arXiv:2408.13101&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 23 Aug 2024 14:24:43 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Unusual energy spectra of matrix product states</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13616</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; J. Maxwell Silvester, Giuseppe Carleo, Steven R. White&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; In approximate ground states obtained from imaginary-time evolution, the spectrum of the state -- its decomposition into exact energy eigenstates -- falls off exponentially with the energy. Here we consider the energy spectra of approximate matrix product ground states, such as those obtained with the density matrix renormalization group. Despite the high accuracy of these states, contributions to the spectra are roughly constant out to surprisingly high energy, with an increase in the bond dimension reducing the amplitude but not the extent of these high-energy tails. The unusual spectra appear to be a general feature of compressed wavefunctions, independent of boundary or dimensionality, and are also observed in neural network wavefunctions. The unusual spectra can have a strong effect on sampling-based methods, yielding large fluctuations. The energy variance, which can be used to extrapolate observables to eliminate truncation error, is subject to these large fluctuations when sampled. Nevertheless, we devise a sampling-based variance approach which gives excellent and efficient extrapolations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13616'&gt;arXiv:2408.13616&lt;/a&gt;] Published Sat, 24 Aug 2024 16:08:21 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Phases and phase transitions in a dimerized spin-$\mathbf{\frac{1}{2}}$ XXZ chain</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14474</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Harsh Nigam, Ashirbad Padhan, Diptiman Sen, Tapan Mishra, Subhro Bhattacharjee&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We revisit the phase diagram of the dimerized XXZ spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ chain with nearest-neighbor couplings which was studied numerically in Phys. Rev. B 106, L201106 (2022). The model has isotropic $XY$ couplings which have a uniform value and $ZZ$ couplings which have a dimerized form, with strengths $J_a$ and $J_b$ on alternate bonds. We find a rich phase diagram in the region of positive $J_a, ~J_b$. We provide a detailed understanding of the different phases and associated quantum phase transitions using a combination of mean-field theory, low-energy effective Hamiltonians, renormalization group calculations employing the technique of bosonization, and numerical calculations using the density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) method. The phase diagram consists of two Ising paramagnetic phases called IPM$_0$ and IPM$_\pi$, and a phase with Ising Neel order called IN; all these phases are gapped. The phases IPM$_0$ and IPM$_\pi$ are separated by a gapless phase transition line given by $0 \le J_a = J_b \le 1$ which is described by a conformal field theory with central charge $c=1$. There are two gapless phase transition lines separating IPM$_0$ from IN and IPM$_\pi$ from IN; these are described by conformal field theories with $c=\frac{1}{2}$ corresponding to quantum Ising transitions. The $c=1$ line bifurcates into the two $c=\frac{1}{2}$ lines at the point $J_a = J_b = 1$; the shape of the bifurcation is found analytically using RG calculations. A symmetry analysis shows that IPM$_0$ is a topologically trivial phase while IPM$_\pi$ is a time-reversal symmetry-protected topological phase (SPT) with spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ states at the two ends of an open system. The numerical results obtained by the DMRG method are in good agreement with the analytical results. Finally we propose experimental platforms for testing our results.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14474'&gt;arXiv:2408.14474&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 26 Aug 2024 17:59:16 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>A recipe for local simulation of strongly-correlated fermionic matter on quantum computers: the 2D Fermi-Hubbard model</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14543</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Arash Jafarizadeh, Frank Pollmann, Adam Gammon-Smith&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The simulation of quantum many-body systems, relevant for quantum chemistry and condensed matter physics, is one of the most promising applications of near-term quantum computers before fault-tolerance. However, since the vast majority of quantum computing technologies are built around qubits and discrete gate-based operations, the translation of the physical problem into this framework is a crucial step. This translation will often be device specific, and a suboptimal implementation will be punished by the exponential compounding of errors on real devices. The importance of an efficient mapping is already revealed for models of spinful fermions in two or three dimensions, which naturally arise when the relevant physics relates to electrons. Using the most direct and well-known mapping, the Jordan-Wigner transformation, leads to a non-local representation of local degrees of freedom, and necessities efficient decompositions of non-local unitary gates into a sequence of hardware accessible local gates. In this paper, we provide a step-by-step recipe for simulating the paradigmatic two-dimensional Fermi-Hubbard model on a quantum computer using only local operations. To provide the ingredients for such a recipe, we briefly review the plethora of different approaches that have emerged recently but focus on the Derby-Klassen compact fermion mapping in order to make our discussion concrete. We provide a detailed recipe for an end-to-end simulation including embedding on a physical device, preparing initial states such as ground states, simulation of unitary time evolution, and measurement of observables and spectral functions. We explicitly compute the resource requirements for simulating a global quantum quench and conclude by discussing the challenges and future directions for simulating strongly-correlated fermionic matter on quantum computers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14543'&gt;arXiv:2408.14543&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 26 Aug 2024 18:00:07 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

Wauters, Lorenzo Maffi, Michele Burrello&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The continuous improvement of fabrication techniques and high-quality semiconductor-superconductor interfaces allowed for unprecedented tunability of Josephson junction arrays (JJA), making them a promising candidate for analog quantum simulations of many-body phenomena. While most experimental proposals so far focused on quantum simulations of ensembles of two-level systems, the possibility of tuning the current-phase relation beyond the sinusoidal regime paves the way for studying statistical physics models with larger local Hilbert spaces. Here, we investigate a particular JJA architecture that can be mapped into a $\mathbb{Z}_3$ clock model. Through matrix-product-states simulations and bosonization analysis, we show that few experimentally accessible control parameters allow for the exploration of the rich phase diagrams of the associated low-energy field theories. Our results expand the horizon for analog quantum simulations with JJAs towards models that can not be efficiently captured with qubit architectures.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14549'&gt;arXiv:2408.14549&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 26 Aug 2024 18:01:22 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Practical quantum advantage on partially fault-tolerant quantum computer</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14848</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Riki Toshio, Yutaro Akahoshi, Jun Fujisaki, Hirotaka Oshima, Shintaro Sato, Keisuke Fujii&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Achieving quantum speedups in practical tasks remains challenging for current noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. These devices always encounter significant obstacles such as inevitable physical errors and the limited scalability of current near-term algorithms. Meanwhile, assuming a typical architecture for fault-tolerant quantum computing (FTQC), realistic applications inevitably require a vast number of qubits, typically exceeding $10^6$, which seems far beyond near-term realization. In this work, to bridge the gap between the NISQ and FTQC eras, we propose an alternative approach to achieve practical quantum advantages on early-FTQC devices. Our framework is based on partially fault-tolerant logical operations to minimize spatial overhead and avoids the costly distillation techniques typically required for executing non-Clifford gates. To this end, we develop a space-time efficient state preparation protocol to generate an ancillary non-Clifford state consumed for implementing an analog rotation gate with an arbitrary small angle $\theta$ and a remarkably low worst-case error rate below $\mathcal{O}(|\theta| p_{\text{ph}})$, where $p_{\text{ph}}$ is the physical error rate. Furthermore, we propose several error suppression schemes tailored to our preparation protocol, which are essential to minimize the overhead for mitigating errors. Based on this framework, we present several promising applications that leverage the potential of our framework, including the Trotter simulation and quantum phase estimation (QPE). Notably, we demonstrate that our framework allows us to perform the QPE for $(8\times 8)$-site Hubbard model with fewer than $4.9\times 10^4$ qubits and an execution time of 9 days (or 12 minutes with full parallelization) under $p_{\text{ph}}=10^{-4}$, which is significantly faster than recent classical estimation with tensor network techniques (DMRG and PEPS).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14848'&gt;arXiv:2408.14848&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 27 Aug 2024 07:58:09 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Quantum Games and Synchronicity</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Adina Goldberg&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; In the flavour of categorical quantum mechanics, we extend nonlocal games to allow quantum questions and answers, using quantum sets (special symmetric dagger Frobenius algebras) and the quantum functions of Musto, Reutter, and Verdon [arXiv:1711.07945]. Equations are presented using a diagrammatic calculus for tensor categories. To this quantum question and answer setting, we extend the standard definitions, including strategies, correlations, and synchronicity, and we use these definitions to extend results about synchronicity. We extend the graph homomorphism (isomorphism) game to quantum graphs, and show it is synchronous (bisynchronous) and connect its perfect (bi)strategies to quantum graph homomorphisms (isomorphisms). Our extended definitions agree with the existing quantum games literature, except in the case of synchronicity.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15444'&gt;arXiv:2408.15444&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 27 Aug 2024 23:27:59 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Volume Changing Symmetries by Matrix Product Operators</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Márton Borsi, Balázs Pozsgay&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We consider spin chain models with exotic symmetries that change the length of the spin chain. It is known that the XXZ Heisenberg spin chain at the supersymmetric point $\Delta=-1/2$ possesses such a symmetry: it is given by the supersymmetry generators, which change the length of the chain by one unit. We show that volume changing symmetries exist also in other spin chain models, and that they can be constructed using a special tensor network, which is a simple generalization of a Matrix Product Operator. As examples we consider the folded XXZ model and its perturbations, and also a new hopping model that is defined on constrained Hilbert spaces. We show that the volume changing symmetries are not related to integrability: the symmetries can survive even non-integrable perturbations. We also show that the known supersymmetry generator of the XXZ chain with $\Delta=-1/2$ can also be expressed as a generalized Matrix Product Operator.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15659'&gt;arXiv:2408.15659&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 28 Aug 2024 09:20:32 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Autoregressive model path dependence near Ising criticality</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15715</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Yi Hong Teoh, Roger G. Melko&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Autoregressive models are a class of generative model that probabilistically predict the next output of a sequence based on previous inputs. The autoregressive sequence is by definition one-dimensional (1D), which is natural for language tasks and hence an important component of modern architectures like recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and transformers. However, when language models are used to predict outputs on physical systems that are not intrinsically 1D, the question arises of which choice of autoregressive sequence -- if any -- is optimal. In this paper, we study the reconstruction of critical correlations in the two-dimensional (2D) Ising model, using RNNs and transformers trained on binary spin data obtained near the thermal phase transition. We compare the training performance for a number of different 1D autoregressive sequences imposed on finite-size 2D lattices. We find that paths with long 1D segments are more efficient at training the autoregressive models compared to space-filling curves that better preserve the 2D locality. Our results illustrate the potential importance in choosing the optimal autoregressive sequence ordering when training modern language models for tasks in physics.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15715'&gt;arXiv:2408.15715&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 28 Aug 2024 11:21:33 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>1+1d SPT phases with fusion category symmetry: interface modes and non-abelian Thouless pump</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15960</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Kansei Inamura, Shuhei Ohyama&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We consider symmetry protected topological (SPT) phases with finite non-invertible symmetry $\mathcal{C}$ in 1+1d. In particular, we investigate interfaces and parameterized families of them within the framework of matrix product states. After revealing how to extract the $\mathcal{C}$-SPT invariant, we identify the algebraic structure of symmetry operators acting on the interface of two $\mathcal{C}$-SPT phases. By studying the representation theory of this algebra, we show that there must be a degenerate interface mode between different $\mathcal{C}$-SPT phases. This result generalizes the bulk-boundary correspondence for ordinary SPT phases. We then propose the classification of one-parameter families of $\mathcal{C}$-SPT states based on the explicit construction of invariants of such families. Our invariant is identified with a non-abelian generalization of the Thouless charge pump, which is the pump of a local excitation within a $\mathcal{C}$-SPT phase. Finally, by generalizing the results for one-parameter families of SPT phases, we conjecture the classification of general parameterized families of general gapped phases with finite non-invertible symmetries in both 1+1d and higher dimensions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15960'&gt;arXiv:2408.15960&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 28 Aug 2024 17:26:18 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Magic Resources of the Heisenberg Picture</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16047</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Neil Dowling, Pavel Kos, Xhek Turkeshi&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We study a non-stabilizerness resource theory for operators, which is dual to that describing states. We identify that the stabilizer Rényi entropy analog in operator space is a good magic monotone satisfying the usual conditions while inheriting efficient computability properties and providing a tight lower bound to the minimum number of non-Clifford gates in a circuit. Operationally, this measure quantifies how well an operator can be approximated by one with only a few Pauli strings -- analogous to how entanglement entropy relates to tensor-network truncation. A notable advantage of operator stabilizer entropies is their inherent locality, as captured by a Lieb-Robinson bound. This feature makes them particularly suited for studying local dynamical magic resource generation in many-body systems. We compute this quantity analytically in two distinct regimes. First, we show that under random evolution, operator magic typically reaches near-maximal value for all Rényi indices, and we evaluate the Page correction. Second, harnessing both dual unitarity and ZX graphical calculus, we solve the operator stabilizer entropy for interacting integrable XXZ circuit, finding that it quickly saturates to a constant value. Overall, this measure sheds light on the structural properties of many-body non-stabilizerness generation and can inspire Clifford-assisted tensor network methods.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16047'&gt;arXiv:2408.16047&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 28 Aug 2024 18:00:01 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Web Service QoS Prediction via Extended Canonical Polyadic-based Tensor Network</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16278</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Qu Wang, Hao Wu&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Today, numerous web services with similar functionalities are available on the Internet. Users often evaluate the Quality of Service (QoS) to choose the best option among them. Predicting the QoS values of these web services is a significant challenge in the field of web services. A Canonical Polyadic (CP)-based tensor network model has proven to be efficient for predicting dynamic QoS data. However, current CP-based tensor network models do not consider the correlation of users and services in the low-dimensional latent feature space, thereby limiting model's prediction capability. To tackle this issue, this paper proposes an Extended Canonical polyadic-based Tensor Network (ECTN) model. It models the correlation of users and services via building a relation dimension between user feature and service feature in low-dimensional space, and then designs an extended CP decomposition structure to improve prediction accuracy. Experiments are conducted on two public dynamic QoS data, and the results show that compared with state-of-the-art QoS prediction models, the ECTN obtains higher prediction accuracy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16278'&gt;arXiv:2408.16278&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 29 Aug 2024 05:56:35 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Convolutional Neural Network Compression Based on Low-Rank Decomposition</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16289</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Yaping He, Linhao Jiang, Di Wu&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Deep neural networks typically impose significant computational loads and memory consumption. Moreover, the large parameters pose constraints on deploying the model on edge devices such as embedded systems. Tensor decomposition offers a clear advantage in compressing large-scale weight tensors. Nevertheless, direct utilization of low-rank decomposition typically leads to significant accuracy loss. This paper proposes a model compression method that integrates Variational Bayesian Matrix Factorization (VBMF) with orthogonal regularization. Initially, the model undergoes over-parameterization and training, with orthogonal regularization applied to enhance its likelihood of achieving the accuracy of the original model. Secondly, VBMF is employed to estimate the rank of the weight tensor at each layer. Our framework is sufficiently general to apply to other convolutional neural networks and easily adaptable to incorporate other tensor decomposition methods. Experimental results show that for both high and low compression ratios, our compression model exhibits advanced performance.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16289'&gt;arXiv:2408.16289&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 29 Aug 2024 06:40:34 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Phase diagram of the J1-J2 Heisenberg second-order topological quantum magnet</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Pascal M. Vecsei, Jose L. Lado&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Competing interactions in quantum magnets lead to a variety of emergent states, including ordered phases, nematic magnets and quantum spin liquids. Among them, topological quantum magnets represent a promising platform to create topological excitations protected by the bulk many-body excitation gap. Here we establish the phase diagram of a breathing frustrated antiferromagnetic J1-J2-Heisenberg model, featuring both ordered states and a higher-order topological quantum magnet state. Using exact many-body methods based on neural network quantum states and tensor networks, we determine the existence of a first order phase transition between stripe order and the topological quantum magnet and the second order phase transition between the Neel order and quantum magnet phase, further corroborated by calculations of the many-body gap. Using an auxiliary fermion parton formalism, we show the emergence of topological spinon corner modes stemming from the breathing order parameter of the parent Heisenberg model. Our results establish the breathing frustrated square lattice Heisenberg model as a paradigmatic system to engineer topological quantum magnetism, as recently realized in Ti lattices at MgO.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16453'&gt;arXiv:2408.16453&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 29 Aug 2024 11:39:53 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Tensor Decomposed Distinguishable Cluster. I. Triples Decomposition</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16681</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Charlotte Rickert, Denis Usvyat, Daniel Kats&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We present a cost-reduced approach for the distinguishable cluster approximation to coupled cluster with singles, doubles and iterative triples (DC-CCSDT) based on a tensor decomposition of the triples amplitudes. The triples amplitudes and residuals are processed in the singular-value-decomposition (SVD) basis. Truncation of the SVD basis according to the values of the singular values together with the density fitting (or Cholesky) factorization of the electron repulsion integrals reduces the scaling of the method to $N^6$, and the DC approximation removes the most expensive terms of the SVD triples residuals and at the same time improves the accuracy of the method. The SVD basis vectors for the triples are obtained from the approximate CC3 triples density matrices constructed in an intermediate SVD basis of doubles amplitudes. This allows us to avoid steps that scale higher than $N^6$ altogether. Tests against DC-CCSDT and CCSDT(Q) on a benchmark set of chemical reactions with closed-shell molecules demonstrate that the SVD-error is very small already with moderate truncation thresholds, especially so when using a CCSD(T) energy correction. Tests on alkane chains demonstrated that the SVD-error grows linearly with system size confirming the size extensivity of SVD-DC-CCSDT within a chosen truncation threshold.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16681'&gt;arXiv:2408.16681&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 29 Aug 2024 16:27:07 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Entanglement of Disjoint Intervals in Dual-Unitary Circuits: Exact Results</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16750</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Alessandro Foligno, Bruno Bertini&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The growth of the entanglement between two disjoint intervals and its complement after a quantum quench is regarded as a dynamical chaos indicator. Namely, it is expected to show qualitatively different behaviours depending on whether the underlying microscopic dynamics is chaotic or integrable. So far, however, this could only be verified in the context of conformal field theories. Here we present an exact confirmation of this expectation in a class of interacting microscopic Floquet systems on the lattice, i.e., dual-unitary circuits. These systems can either have zero or a super extensive number of conserved charges: the latter case is achieved via fine-tuning. We show that, for almost all dual unitary circuits on qubits and for a large family of dual-unitary circuits on qudits the asymptotic entanglement dynamics agrees with what is expected for chaotic systems. On the other hand, if we require the systems to have conserved charges, we find that the entanglement displays the qualitatively different behaviour expected for integrable systems. Interestingly, despite having many conserved charges, charge-conserving dual-unitary circuits are in general not Yang-Baxter integrable.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16750'&gt;arXiv:2408.16750&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 29 Aug 2024 17:45:27 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Efficient and systematic calculation of arbitrary observables for the matrix product state excitation ansatz</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17117</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Jesse J. Osborne, Ian P. McCulloch&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Numerical methods based on matrix product states (MPSs) are currently the de facto standard for calculating the ground-state properties of (quasi-)one-dimensional quantum many-body systems. While the properties of the low-lying excitations in such systems are often studied in this MPS framework through _dynamics_ by means of time-evolution simulations, we can also look at their _statics_ by directly calculating eigenstates corresponding to these excitations. The so-called MPS excitation ansatz is a powerful method for finding such eigenstates with a single-particle character in the thermodynamic limit. Although this excitation ansatz has been used quite extensively, a general method for calculating expectation values for these states is lacking in the literature: we aim to fill this gap by presenting a recursive algorithm to calculate arbitrary observables expressed as matrix product operators. This method concisely encapsulates existing methods for -- as well as extensions to -- the excitation ansatz, such as excitations with a larger spatial support and multi-particle excitations, and is robust enough to handle further innovations. We demonstrate the versatility of our method by studying the low-lying excitations in the spin-1 Heisenberg chain and the one-dimensional Hubbard model, looking at how the excitations converge in the former, while in the latter, we present a refined method of targeting single-particle excitations inside a continuum by minimizing the energy _variance_ rather than the energy itself. We hope that this technique will foster further advancements with the excitation ansatz.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17117'&gt;arXiv:2408.17117&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 30 Aug 2024 08:59:29 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Non-Landau quantum phase transition in modulated SU(N) Heisenberg spin chains</title>

In the odd-N case, the transition separates a trivial non-degenerate phase to a doubly-degenerate gapped chiral PSU(N) symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phase which breaks spontaneously the inversion symmetry. The transition is not an Ising transition associated to the breaking of the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ inversion symmetry, but is governed by the delocalization of the edge states of the SPT phase. In this respect, a modulated SU(N) Heisenberg spin chain provides a simple example in one dimension of a non-Landau phase transition which is described by the SU(N)$_1$ conformal field theory. We show that the chiral SPT phase exhibits fractionalized spinon excitations, which can be confined by changing the model parameters slightly.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01019'&gt;arXiv:2409.01019&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 02 Sep 2024 07:54:45 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Lee-Yang formalism for phase transitions of interacting fermions using tensor networks</title>

Lado, Christian Flindt&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Predicting the phase diagram of interacting quantum many-body systems is a challenging problem in condensed matter physics. Strong interactions and correlation effects may lead to exotic states of matter, such as quantum spin liquids and unconventional superconductors, that often compete with other symmetry broken states including ordered magnets and charge density waves. Here, we put forward a formalism for determining the phase diagram of fermionic systems that combines recent progress in the field of Lee-Yang theory of phase transitions with many-body tensor-network methods. Using this strategy, we map out the phase diagram of a fermionic chain, where charge density waves form owing to strong repulsion. Specifically, from the high cumulants of the order parameter, we extract the dominant zeros of the moment-generating function in chains of finite size. By extrapolating their positions to the thermodynamic limit, we determine the boundaries between competing phases. Our formalism provides a strategy for determining critical points in fermionic systems, and it is based on fluctuations of the order parameter, which are measurable quantities.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01503'&gt;arXiv:2409.01503&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 03 Sep 2024 00:00:56 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Learning out-of-time-ordered correlators with classical kernel methods</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01592</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; John Tanner, Jason Pye, Jingbo Wang&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Out-of-Time Ordered Correlators (OTOCs) are widely used to investigate information scrambling in quantum systems. However, directly computing OTOCs with classical computers is an expensive procedure. This is due to the need to classically simulate the dynamics of quantum many-body systems, which entails computational costs that scale rapidly with system size. Similarly, exact simulation of the dynamics with a quantum computer (QC) will either only be possible for short times with noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices, or will require a fault-tolerant QC which is currently beyond technological capabilities. This motivates a search for alternative approaches to determine OTOCs and related quantities. In this study, we explore four parameterised sets of Hamiltonians describing local one-dimensional quantum systems of interest in condensed matter physics. For each set, we investigate whether classical kernel methods (KMs) can accurately learn the XZ-OTOC and a particular sum of OTOCs, as functions of the Hamiltonian parameters. We frame the problem as a regression task, generating small batches of labelled data with classical tensor network methods for quantum many-body systems with up to 40 qubits. Using this data, we train a variety of standard kernel machines and observe that the Laplacian and radial basis function (RBF) kernels perform best, achieving a coefficient of determination (\(R^2\)) on the testing sets of at least 0.7167, with averages between 0.8112 and 0.9822 for the various sets of Hamiltonians, together with small root mean squared error and mean absolute error. Hence, after training, the models can replace further uses of tensor networks for calculating an OTOC function of a system within the parameterised sets. Accordingly, the proposed method can assist with extensive evaluations of an OTOC function.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01592'&gt;arXiv:2409.01592&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 03 Sep 2024 04:20:24 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>AQ-PINNs: Attention-Enhanced Quantum Physics-Informed Neural Networks for Carbon-Efficient Climate Modeling</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01626</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Siddhant Dutta, Nouhaila Innan, Sadok Ben Yahia, Muhammad Shafique&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The growing computational demands of artificial intelligence (AI) in addressing climate change raise significant concerns about inefficiencies and environmental impact, as highlighted by the Jevons paradox. We propose an attention-enhanced quantum physics-informed neural networks model (AQ-PINNs) to tackle these challenges. This approach integrates quantum computing techniques into physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) for climate modeling, aiming to enhance predictive accuracy in fluid dynamics governed by the Navier-Stokes equations while reducing the computational burden and carbon footprint. By harnessing variational quantum multi-head self-attention mechanisms, our AQ-PINNs achieve a 51.51% reduction in model parameters compared to classical multi-head self-attention methods while maintaining comparable convergence and loss. It also employs quantum tensor networks to enhance representational capacity, which can lead to more efficient gradient computations and reduced susceptibility to barren plateaus. Our AQ-PINNs represent a crucial step towards more sustainable and effective climate modeling solutions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01626'&gt;arXiv:2409.01626&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 03 Sep 2024 05:52:04 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Quick design of feasible tensor networks for constrained combinatorial optimization</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01699</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Hyakka Nakada, Kotaro Tanahashi, Shu Tanaka&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Quantum computers are expected to enable fast solving of large-scale combinatorial optimization problems. However, their limitations in fidelity and the number of qubits prevent them from handling real-world problems. Recently, a quantum-inspired solver using tensor networks has been proposed, which works on classical computers. Particularly, tensor networks have been applied to constrained combinatorial optimization problems for practical applications. By preparing a specific tensor network to sample states that satisfy constraints, feasible solutions can be searched for without the method of penalty functions. Previous studies have been based on profound physics, such as U(1) gauge schemes and high-dimensional lattice models. In this study, we devise to design feasible tensor networks using elementary mathematics without such a specific knowledge. One approach is to construct tensor networks with nilpotent-matrix manipulation. The second is to algebraically determine tensor parameters. We showed mathematically that such feasible tensor networks can be constructed to accommodate various types of constraints. For the principle verification, we numerically constructed a feasible tensor network for facility location problem, to find much faster construction than conventional methods. Then, by performing imaginary time evolution, feasible solutions were always obtained, ultimately leading to the optimal solution.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01699'&gt;arXiv:2409.01699&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 03 Sep 2024 08:36:23 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Bulk-boundary correspondence from hyper-invariant tensor networks</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Rafał Bistroń, Mykhailo Hontarenko, Karol Życzkowski&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We introduce a tensor network designed to faithfully simulate the AdS/CFT correspondence, akin to the multi-scale entanglement renormalization ansatz (MERA), following hyper-invariant tensor network. The proposed construction integrates bulk indices within the network architecture to uphold the key features of the HaPPY code, including complementary recovery. This framework accurately reproduces the boundary conformal field theory's (CFT) two- and three-point correlation functions, while considering the image of any bulk operator. Furthermore, we provide an explicit methodology for calculating the correlation functions in an efficient manner. Our findings highlight the physical aspects of the relation between bulk and boundary within the tensor network models, contributing to the understanding and simulation of holographic principles in quantum information.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02029'&gt;arXiv:2409.02029&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 03 Sep 2024 16:24:18 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic properties of the macroscopically degenerate tetramer-dimer phase of the spin-1/2 Heisenberg model on the diamond-decorated square lattice</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02183</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Katarina Karlova, Andreas Honecker, Nils Caci, Stefan Wessel, Jozef Strecka, Taras Verkholyak&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The spin-1/2 Heisenberg antiferromagnet on the diamond-decorated square lattice in the presence of a magnetic field displays various quantum phases including the Lieb-Mattis ferrimagnetic, dimer-tetramer, monomer-dimer, and spin-canted phases, in addition to the trivial fully saturated state. Thermodynamic properties of this model are investigated using several complementary analytical and numerical methods such as exact diagonalization up to the systems of 40 spins, an effective monomer-dimer description, sign-problem-free quantum Monte Carlo simulations for up to 180 spins, and a decoupling approximation. Our particular attention is focused on the parameter region favoring the dimer-tetramer phase. This ground state can be represented by a classical hard-dimer model on the square lattice and retains a macroscopic degeneracy even under a magnetic field. However, the description of the low-temperature thermodynamics close to the boundary between the macroscopically degenerate dimer-tetramer and the non-degenerate monomer-dimer phases requires an extended classical monomer-dimer lattice-gas model. Anomalous thermodynamic properties emerging in the vicinity of the dimer-tetramer phase are studied in detail. Under the adiabatic demagnetization we detect an enhanced magnetocaloric effect promoting an efficient cooling to absolute zero temperature, provided that the system reaches the dimer-tetramer ground state at zero field.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02183'&gt;arXiv:2409.02183&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 03 Sep 2024 18:00:05 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>$Z_2$ flux binding to higher-spin impurities in the Kitaev spin liquid</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02190</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Masahiro O. Takahashi, Wen-Han Kao, Satoshi Fujimoto, Natalia B. Perkins&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Stabilizing $Z_2$ fluxes in Kitaev spin liquids (KSLs) is crucial for both characterizing candidate materials and identifying Ising anyons. In this study, we investigate the effects of spin-$S$ magnetic impurities embedded in the spin-1/2 KSL. Utilizing exact diagonalization and density matrix renormalization group methods, we examine the impurity magnetization and ground-state flux sector with varying impurity coupling and spin size. Our findings reveal that impurity magnetization exhibits an integer/half-integer spin dependence, which aligns with analytical predictions, and a flux-sector transition from bound-flux to zero-flux occurs at low coupling strengths, independent of the impurity spin. Notably, for spin-3/2 impurities, we observe a reentrant bound-flux sector, which remains stable under magnetic fields. By considering fermionic representations of our spin Hamiltonian, we provide phenomenological explanations for the transitions. Our results suggest a novel way of binding a flux in KSLs, beyond the proposals of vacancies or Kondo impurities.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02190'&gt;arXiv:2409.02190&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 03 Sep 2024 18:01:27 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Bundled matrix product states represent low-energy excitations faithfully</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02362</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Thomas E. Baker, Negar Seif&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We consider a set of density matrices. All of which are written in the same orbital basis, but the orbital basis size is less than the total Hilbert space size. We ask how each density matrix is related to each of the others by establishing a norm between density matrices based on the truncation error in a partial trace for a small set of orbitals. We find that states with large energy differences must have large differences in their density matrices. Small energy differences are divided into two groups, one where two density matrices have small differences and another where they are very different, as is the case of symmetry. We extend these ideas to a bundle of matrix product states and show that bond dimension of the wavefunction ansatz for two states with large energy differences are larger. Meanwhile, low energy differences can have nearly the same bond dimensions for similar states.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02362'&gt;arXiv:2409.02362&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 04 Sep 2024 01:18:19 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Provably Efficient Simulation of 1D Long-Range Interacting Systems at Any Temperature</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Rakesh Achutha, Donghoon Kim, Yusuke Kimura, Tomotaka Kuwahara&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We introduce a method that ensures efficient computation of one-dimensional quantum systems with long-range interactions across all temperatures. Our algorithm operates within a quasi-polynomial runtime for inverse temperatures up to $\beta={\rm poly}(\ln(n))$. At the core of our approach is the Density Matrix Renormalization Group algorithm, which typically does not guarantee efficiency. We have created a new truncation scheme for the matrix product operator of the quantum Gibbs states, which allows us to control the error analytically. Additionally, our method can be applied to simulate the time evolution of systems with long-range interactions, achieving significantly better precision than that offered by the Lieb-Robinson bound.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02819'&gt;arXiv:2409.02819&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 04 Sep 2024 15:37:54 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Frustrated S = 1/2 Chains in One-Dimensional Correlated Metal Ti4MnBi2</title>

Aronson&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Electronic correlations lead to heavy quasiparticles in three-dimensional (3D) metals, and their collapse can destabilize magnetic moments. It is an open question whether there is an analogous instability in one-dimensional (1D) systems, unanswered due to the lack of metallic spin chain materials. We report neutron scattering measurements and Density Matrix Renormalization Group calculations establishing spinons in the correlated metal Ti4MnBi2, confirming that its magnetism is 1D. Ti4MnBi2 is inherently frustrated, forming near a quantum critical point (QCP) separating different temperature T = 0 phases of the J1-J2 XXZ model. 1D magnetism dominates to the lowest T, and is barely affected by weak interchain coupling. Ti4MnBi2 is the first metallic spin chain where 3D conduction electrons become strongly correlated due to their coupling to 1D magnetic moments.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02880'&gt;arXiv:2409.02880&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 04 Sep 2024 17:06:31 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Pseudospectral method for solving PDEs using Matrix Product States</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02916</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Jorge Gidi, Paula García-Molina, Luca Tagliacozzo, Juan José García-Ripoll&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; This research focuses on solving time-dependent partial differential equations (PDEs), in particular the time-dependent Schrödinger equation, using matrix product states (MPS). We propose an extension of Hermite Distributed Approximating Functionals (HDAF) to MPS, a highly accurate pseudospectral method for approximating functions of derivatives. Integrating HDAF into an MPS finite precision algebra, we test four types of quantum-inspired algorithms for time evolution: explicit Runge-Kutta methods, Crank-Nicolson method, explicitly restarted Arnoli iteration and split-step. The benchmark problem is the expansion of a particle in a quantum quench, characterized by a rapid increase in space requirements, where HDAF surpasses traditional finite difference methods in accuracy with a comparable cost. Moreover, the efficient HDAF approximation to the free propagator avoids the need for Fourier transforms in split-step methods, significantly enhancing their performance with an improved balance in cost and accuracy. Both approaches exhibit similar error scaling and run times compared to FFT vector methods; however, MPS offer an exponential advantage in memory, overcoming vector limitations to enable larger discretizations and expansions. Finally, the MPS HDAF split-step method successfully reproduces the physical behavior of a particle expansion in a double-well potential, demonstrating viability for actual research scenarios.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02916'&gt;arXiv:2409.02916&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 04 Sep 2024 17:53:38 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Real-time operator evolution in two and three dimensions via sparse Pauli dynamics</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03097</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Tomislav Begušić, Garnet Kin-Lic Chan&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We study real-time operator evolution using sparse Pauli dynamics, a recently developed method for simulating expectation values of quantum circuits. On the examples of energy and charge diffusion in 1D spin chains and sudden quench dynamics in the 2D transverse-field Ising model, it is shown that this approach can compete with state-of-the-art tensor network methods. We further demonstrate the flexibility of the approach by studying quench dynamics in the 3D transverse-field Ising model which is highly challenging for tensor network methods. For the simulation of expectation value dynamics starting in a computational basis state, we introduce an extension of sparse Pauli dynamics that truncates the growing sum of Pauli operators by discarding terms with a large number of X and Y matrices. This is validated by our 2D and 3D simulations. Finally, we argue that sparse Pauli dynamics is not only capable of converging challenging observables to high accuracy, but can also serve as a reliable approximate approach even when given only limited computational resources.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03097'&gt;arXiv:2409.03097&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 04 Sep 2024 21:57:44 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium steady-state thermoelectrics of Kondo-correlated quantum dots</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Anand Manaparambil, Andreas Weichselbaum, Jan von Delft, Ireneusz Weymann&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The transport across a Kondo-correlated quantum dot coupled to two leads with independent temperatures and chemical potentials is studied using a controlled non-perturbative, and in this sense exact numeric treatment based on a hybrid numerical renormalization group combined with time-dependent density matrix renormalization group (NRG-tDMRG). We find a peak in the conductance at finite voltage bias vs. the temperature gradient $\Delta T = T_R - T_L$ across left and right lead. We then focus predominantly on zero voltage bias but finite $\Delta T$ far beyond linear response. We reveal the dependence of the characteristic zero-bias conductance on the individual lead temperatures. We find that the finite-$\Delta T$ data behaves quantitatively similar to linear response with an effective equilibrium temperature derived from the different lead temperatures. The regime of sign changes in the Seebeck coefficient, signaling the presence of Kondo correlations, and its dependence on the individual lead temperatures provide a complete picture of the Kondo regime in the presence of finite temperature gradients. The results from the zero-bias conductance and Seebeck coefficient studies unveil an approximate `Kondo circle' in the $T_L/T_R$ plane as the regime within which the Kondo correlations dominate. We also study the heat current and the corresponding heat conductance vs. finite $\Delta T$. We provide a polynomial fit for our numerical results for the thermocurrent as a function of the individual lead temperatures which may be used to fit experimental data in the Kondo regime.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03102'&gt;arXiv:2409.03102&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 04 Sep 2024 22:02:20 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Loop Series Expansions for Tensor Networks</title>

In this manuscript we describe how a loop series expansion can be applied to systematically improve the accuracy of a BP approximation to a tensor network contraction, in principle converging arbitrarily close to the exact result. More generally, our result provides a framework for expanding a tensor network as a sum of component networks in a hierarchy of increasing complexity. We benchmark this proposal for the contraction of iPEPS, either representing the ground state of an AKLT model or with randomly defined tensors, where it is shown to improve in accuracy over standard BP by several orders of magnitude whilst incurring only a minor increase in computational cost. These results indicate that the proposed series expansions could be a useful tool to accurately evaluate tensor networks in cases that otherwise exceed the limits of established contraction routines.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03108'&gt;arXiv:2409.03108&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 04 Sep 2024 22:22:35 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Boundary dissipative spin chains with partial solvability inherited from system Hamiltonians</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Chihiro Matsui, Naoto Tsuji&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Partial solvability plays an important role in the context of statistical mechanics, since it has turned out to be closely related to the emergence of quantum many-body scar states, i.e., exceptional energy eigenstates which do not obey the strong version of the eigenstate themalization hypothesis. We show that partial solvability of a quantum many-body system can be maintained even when the system is coupled to boundary dissipators under certain conditions. We propose two mechanisms that support partially solvable structures in boundary dissipative systems: The first one is based on the restricted spectrum generating algebra, while the second one is based on the Hilbert space fragmentation. From these structures, we derive exact eigenmodes of the Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad equation for a family of quantum spin chain models with boundary dissipators, where we find various intriguing phenomena arising from the partial solvability of the open quantum systems, including persistent oscillations (quantum synchronization) and the existence of the matrix product operator symmetry. We discuss how the presence of solvable eigenmodes affects long-time behaviors of observables in boundary dissipative spin chains based on numerical simulations using the quantum trajectory method.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03208'&gt;arXiv:2409.03208&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 05 Sep 2024 03:03:19 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Tensor network square root Kalman filter for online Gaussian process regression</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Clara Menzen, Manon Kok, Kim Batselier&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The state-of-the-art tensor network Kalman filter lifts the curse of dimensionality for high-dimensional recursive estimation problems. However, the required rounding operation can cause filter divergence due to the loss of positive definiteness of covariance matrices. We solve this issue by developing, for the first time, a tensor network square root Kalman filter, and apply it to high-dimensional online Gaussian process regression. In our experiments, we demonstrate that our method is equivalent to the conventional Kalman filter when choosing a full-rank tensor network. Furthermore, we apply our method to a real-life system identification problem where we estimate $4^{14}$ parameters on a standard laptop. The estimated model outperforms the state-of-the-art tensor network Kalman filter in terms of prediction accuracy and uncertainty quantification.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03276'&gt;arXiv:2409.03276&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 05 Sep 2024 06:38:27 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Fourier Neural Operators for Learning Dynamics in Quantum Spin Systems</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03302</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Freya Shah, Taylor L. Patti, Julius Berner, Bahareh Tolooshams, Jean Kossaifi, Anima Anandkumar&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs) excel on tasks using functional data, such as those originating from partial differential equations. Such characteristics render them an effective approach for simulating the time evolution of quantum wavefunctions, which is a computationally challenging, yet coveted task for understanding quantum systems. In this manuscript, we use FNOs to model the evolution of random quantum spin systems, so chosen due to their representative quantum dynamics and minimal symmetry. We explore two distinct FNO architectures and examine their performance for learning and predicting time evolution using both random and low-energy input states. Additionally, we apply FNOs to a compact set of Hamiltonian observables ($\sim\text{poly}(n)$) instead of the entire $2^n$ quantum wavefunction, which greatly reduces the size of our inputs and outputs and, consequently, the requisite dimensions of the resulting FNOs. Moreover, this Hamiltonian observable-based method demonstrates that FNOs can effectively distill information from high-dimensional spaces into lower-dimensional spaces. The extrapolation of Hamiltonian observables to times later than those used in training is of particular interest, as this stands to fundamentally increase the simulatability of quantum systems past both the coherence times of contemporary quantum architectures and the circuit-depths of tractable tensor networks.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03302'&gt;arXiv:2409.03302&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 05 Sep 2024 07:18:09 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Quantum Red TEA on CPUs, GPUs, and TPUs</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03818</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Daniel Jaschke, Marco Ballarin, Nora Reinić, Luka Pavešić, Simone Montangero&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We benchmark simulations of many-body quantum systems on heterogeneous hardware platforms using CPUs, GPUs, and TPUs. We compare different linear algebra backends, e.g., NumPy versus the PyTorch, JAX, or TensorFlow libraries, as well as a mixed-precision-inspired approach and optimizations for the target hardware. Quantum Red TEA out of the Quantum TEA library specifically addresses handling tensors with different libraries or hardware, where the tensors are the building blocks of tensor network algorithms. The benchmark problem is a variational search of a ground state in an interacting model. This is a ubiquitous problem in quantum many-body physics, which we solve using tensor network methods. This approximate state-of-the-art method compresses quantum correlations which is key to overcoming the exponential growth of the Hilbert space as a function of the number of particles. We present a way to obtain speedups of a factor of 34 when tuning parameters on the CPU, and an additional factor of 2.76 on top of the best CPU setup when migrating to GPUs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03818'&gt;arXiv:2409.03818&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 05 Sep 2024 18:00:01 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Hacking Cryptographic Protocols with Tensor Network Attacks</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04125</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Borja Aizpurua, Siddhartha Patra, Josu Etxezarreta Martinez, Roman Orus&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Here we introduce the application of Tensor Networks (TN) to launch attacks on symmetric-key cryptography. Our approaches make use of Matrix Product States (MPS) as well as our recently-introduced Flexible-PEPS Quantum Circuit Simulator (FQCS). We compare these approaches with traditional brute-force attacks and Variational Quantum Attack Algorithm (VQAA) methods also proposed by us. Our benchmarks include the Simplified Data Encryption Standard (S-DES) with 10-bit keys, Simplified Advanced Encryption Standard (S-AES) with 16-bit keys, and Blowfish with 32-bit keys. We find that for small key size, MPS outperforms VQAA and FQCS in both time and average iterations required to recover the key. As key size increases, FQCS becomes more efficient in terms of average iterations compared to VQAA and MPS, while MPS remains the fastest in terms of time. These results highlight the potential of TN methods in advancing quantum cryptanalysis, particularly in optimizing both speed and efficiency. Our results also show that entanglement becomes crucial as key size increases.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04125'&gt;arXiv:2409.04125&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 06 Sep 2024 08:51:31 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Connectivity matters: Impact of bath modes ordering and geometry in open quantum system simulation with Tensor Network States</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04145</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Thibaut Lacroix, Brendon W. Lovett, Alex W. Chin&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Being able to study the dynamics of quantum systems interacting with several environments is important in many settings ranging from quantum chemistry to quantum thermodynamics, through out-of-equilibrium systems. For such problems tensor network-based methods are state-of-the-art approaches for performing numerically exact simulations. However, to be used efficiently in this multi-environment and non-perturbative context, these methods require an optimized choice of the topology of the wave-function Ansätze. This is often done by analysing cross-correlations between different system and environment degrees of freedom. Here, we show for canonical model Hamiltonians that simple orderings of bosonic environmental modes, which enable the joint {System + Environments} state to be written as a matrix product state, considerably reduce the bond dimension required for convergence despite introducing long-ranged interactions. These results suggest that complex correlation analyses for tweaking tensor networks topology (e.g. entanglement renormalization) are usually not necessary and that tree tensor network states are sub-optimal compared to simple matrix product states in many important models of physical open systems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04145'&gt;arXiv:2409.04145&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 06 Sep 2024 09:20:08 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Classical Algorithms for Hamiltonian Dynamics Mean Value and Guided Local Hamiltonian Problem</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04161</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Yusen Wu, Yukun Zhang, Chuan Wang, Xiao Yuan&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The efficient simulation of quantum dynamics and ground states is a central challenge in physics and a key frontier for quantum advantage. While short-time evolution in one-dimensional systems can often be simulated classically, extending this to higher dimensions remains difficult. Here, we introduce an efficient classical algorithm for simulating the short-time dynamics of arbitrary local quantum systems. For any local Hamiltonian $H$ and constant evolution time $t$, our method estimates expectation values of the form $\langle\psi|e^{iHt}Oe^{-iHt}|\psi\rangle$ for global Pauli observables $O$ and stabilizer states $|\psi\rangle$, with high precision and exponentially small failure probability. Furthermore, we present a classical dequantization of a tailored quantum algorithm that efficiently solves the guided local Hamiltonian (GLH) problem to constant additive error - previously considered classically hard and hence a promising candidate for quantum computational advantage. These results reveal unexpected classical tractability in constant-time quantum dynamics and fundamental connections between Hamiltonian dynamics mean value and the GLH problem. Our work refines the boundary between classical and quantum computational power, identifying sharper criteria for regimes where quantum advantage may genuinely emerge.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04161'&gt;arXiv:2409.04161&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 06 Sep 2024 09:59:12 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Pairing tendencies in the doped Kitaev-Heisenberg model</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04389</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Pontus Laurell, Bradraj Pandey, Gábor B. Halász, Satoshi Okamoto, Gonzalo Alvarez, Elbio Dagotto&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We study the impact of hole-doping on the Kitaev-Heisenberg model on the honeycomb lattice. We investigate the pairing tendencies and correlation functions in the framework of a $t-J-K$ model using density matrix renormalization group calculations on three-leg cylinders. In the case of the pure Kitaev model, which realizes a quantum spin-liquid phase at half-filling, we find that binding of two holes only occurs at low values of the hopping, where the holes are slow. We have theoretically verified that pair formation occurs in the limit of immobile holes, where the pure Kitaev model remains exactly solvable. When we instead fix the hopping at an intermediate, more realistic, value, and vary the Heisenberg and Kitaev interaction strengths, we find pairing tendencies only in the Néel phase. This is in contrast to prior mean-field calculations, highlighting the importance of accounting for the kinetic energy of dopants in generalized Kitaev models. Interestingly, we also find signatures of pair-density wave formation over the studied range of model parameters, namely a periodic modulation of the charge density as well as the spin-spin and pair-pair correlations in real space. Moreover, we present a comparative study of the different correlations as a function of doping. We finally discuss the potential for experimentally observing the studied physics in quantum materials and heterostructures.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04389'&gt;arXiv:2409.04389&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 06 Sep 2024 16:27:58 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>An efficient finite-resource formulation of non-Abelian lattice gauge theories beyond one dimension</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04441</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Pierpaolo Fontana, Marc Miranda Riaza, Alessio Celi&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Non-Abelian gauge theories provide an accurate description of fundamental interactions, as both perturbation theory and quantum Monte Carlo computations in lattice gauge theory, it when applicable, show remarkable agreement with experimental data from particle colliders and cosmological observations. Complementing these computations, or combining them with quantum-inspired Hamiltonian lattice computations on quantum machines to improve continuum limit predictions with current quantum resources, is a formidable open challenge. Here, we propose a resource-efficient method to compute the running of the coupling in non-Abelian gauge theories beyond one spatial dimension. We first represent the Hamiltonian on periodic lattices in terms of loop variables and conjugate loop electric fields, exploiting the Gauss law to retain the gauge-independent ones. Then, we identify a local basis for small and large loops variationally to minimize the truncation error while computing the running of the coupling on small tori. Our method enables computations at arbitrary values of the bare coupling and lattice spacing with current quantum computers, simulators and tensor-network calculations, in regimes otherwise inaccessible.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04441'&gt;arXiv:2409.04441&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 06 Sep 2024 17:59:24 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Radiative Higgs mode in photoinduced $η$ pairs</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Satoshi Ejima, Benedikt Fauseweh&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We demonstrate that the $\eta$ symmetry of the pump-induced $\eta$-pairing state in the Hubbard chain can be transiently broken by an additionally applied probe pulse. This leads to characteristic dynamic Higgs oscillations of the $\eta$-pair correlations during the probe pulse and a sharp dynamic negative optical conductivity $\sigma(\omega;t)$, which appears above the equilibrium Mott gap $\omega&gt;\Delta_{\rm c}$, long after the pump pulse is finished. This negative peak in the real part of $\sigma(\omega;t)$ is a distinctive hallmark of the photoinduced $\eta$-pairing state, distinguishing it from parameter regimes dominated by incoherent doublon formation, which do not exhibit this feature. Remarkably, the broadband probe pulse then leads to the emission of photons with the Higgs frequency.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04604'&gt;arXiv:2409.04604&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 06 Sep 2024 20:23:08 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>A Unified Framework for Cluster Methods with Tensor Networks</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04729</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Erdong Guo, David Draper&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), and Tensor Networks (TN) are two powerful frameworks for numerically investigating many-body systems, each offering distinct advantages. MCMC, with its flexibility and theoretical consistency, is well-suited for simulating arbitrary systems by sampling. TN, on the other hand, provides a powerful tensor-based language for capturing the entanglement properties intrinsic to many-body systems, offering a universal representation of these systems. In this work, we leverage the computational strengths of TN to design a versatile cluster MCMC sampler. Specifically, we propose a general framework for constructing tensor-based cluster MCMC methods, enabling arbitrary cluster updates by utilizing TNs to compute the distributions required in the MCMC sampler. Our framework unifies several existing cluster algorithms as special cases and allows for natural extensions. We demonstrate our method by applying it to the simulation of the two-dimensional Edwards-Anderson Model and the three-dimensional Ising Model. This work is dedicated to the memory of Prof. David Draper.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04729'&gt;arXiv:2409.04729&lt;/a&gt;] Published Sat, 07 Sep 2024 06:25:18 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Floquet dynamical chiral spin liquid at finite frequency</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04892</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Didier Poilblanc, Matthieu Mambrini, Nathan Goldman&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Chiral Spin Liquids (CSL) are quantum spin analogs of electronic Fractional Chern Insulators. Their realizations on ultracold-atom or Rydberg-atom platforms remain very challenging. Recently, a setup of time-periodic modulations of nearest-neighbor Heisenberg couplings applied on an initial genuine spin liquid state on the square lattice has been proposed to stabilize a (Abelian) $\mathbb{Z}_2$ CSL phase. In the high-frequency limit, it was shown that time evolution can be described in terms of a static effective chiral Hamiltonian. Here we revisit this proposal and consider drives at lower frequency in a regime where the high-frequency Magnus expansion fails. We show that a Dynamical CSL (DCSL) is nevertheless stabilized in a finite range of frequency. The topological nature of this dynamical phase, as well as its instability below a critical frequency, is connected to specific features of the Floquet pseudo-energy spectrum. We also show that the DCSL can be represented faithfully by a two-dimensional time-periodic tensor network and, as in the static case, topological order is associated to a tensor gauge symmetry ($\mathbb{Z}_2$ in that case).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04892'&gt;arXiv:2409.04892&lt;/a&gt;] Published Sat, 07 Sep 2024 19:23:11 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

Domínguez-Castro, Thomas Bilitewski, Monika Aidelsburger, Ana Maria Rey, Luis Santos&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We investigate the quantum many-body dynamics of bosonic atoms hopping in a two-leg ladder with strong on-site contact interactions. We observe that when the atoms are prepared in a staggered pattern with pairs of atoms on every other rung, singlon defects, i.e.~rungs with only one atom, can localize due to an emergent topological model, even though the underlying model in the absence of interactions admits only topologically trivial states. This emergent topological localization results from the formation of a zero-energy edge mode in an effective lattice formed by two adjacent chains with alternating strong and weak hoping links (Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chains) and opposite staggering which interface at the defect position. Our findings open the opportunity to dynamically generate non-trivial topological behaviors without the need for complex Hamiltonian engineering.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05109'&gt;arXiv:2409.05109&lt;/a&gt;] Published Sun, 08 Sep 2024 14:41:50 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

Pereira, Alessandro Cuccoli, Leonardo Banchi&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We study the identification of quantum phases of matter, at zero temperature, when only part of the phase diagram is known in advance. Following a supervised learning approach, we show how to use our previous knowledge to construct an observable capable of classifying the phase even in the unknown region. By using a combination of classical and quantum techniques, such as tensor networks, kernel methods, generalization bounds, quantum algorithms, and shadow estimators, we show that, in some cases, the certification of new ground states can be obtained with a polynomial number of measurements. An important application of our findings is the classification of the phases of matter obtained in quantum simulators, e.g., cold atom experiments, capable of efficiently preparing ground states of complex many-particle systems and applying simple measurements, e.g., single qubit measurements, but unable to perform a universal set of gates.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05188'&gt;arXiv:2409.05188&lt;/a&gt;] Published Sun, 08 Sep 2024 18:52:34 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

We validate our method by benchmarking it against the 2D antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model, the $J_1$-$J_2$ model, and the Fermi-Hubbard model, comparing physical properties such as internal energy, specific heat, and magnetic susceptibility with results obtained from stochastic series expansion (SSE), exact diagonalization, and determinant quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05285'&gt;arXiv:2409.05285&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 09 Sep 2024 02:40:20 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Measuring temporal entanglement in experiments as a hallmark for integrability</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Aleix Bou-Comas, Carlos Ramos Marimón, Jan T. Schneider, Stefano Carignano, Luca Tagliacozzo&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We introduce a novel experimental approach to probe many-body quantum systems by developing a protocol to measure generalized temporal entropies. We demonstrate that the recently proposed generalized temporal entropies [Phys. Rev. Research 6, 033021] are equivalent to observing the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of a replicated system induced by a double quench protocol using local operators as probes. This equivalence, confirmed through state-of-the-art tensor network simulations for one-dimensional systems, validates the feasibility of measuring generalized temporal entropies experimentally. Our results reveal that the dynamics governed by the transverse field Ising model integrable Hamiltonian differ qualitatively from those driven by the same model with an additional parallel field, breaking integrability. They thus suggest that generalized temporal entropies can serve as a tool for identifying different dynamical classes. This work represents the first practical application of generalized temporal entropy characterization in one-dimensional many-body quantum systems and offers a new pathway for experimentally detecting integrability. We conclude by outlining the experimental requirements for implementing this protocol with state of the art quantum simulators.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05517'&gt;arXiv:2409.05517&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 09 Sep 2024 11:21:19 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Simulating real-time molecular electron dynamics efficiently using the time-dependent density matrix renormalization group</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05959</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Imam S. Wahyutama, Henrik R. Larsson&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Compared to ground state electronic structure optimizations, accurate simulations of molecular real-time electron dynamics are usually much more difficult to perform. To simulate electron dynamics, the time-dependent density matrix renormalization group (TDDMRG) has been shown to offer an attractive compromise between accuracy and cost. However, many simulation parameters significantly affect the quality and efficiency of a TDDMRG simulation. So far, it is unclear whether common wisdom from ground state DMRG carries over to the TDDMRG, and a guideline on how to choose these parameters is missing. Here, in order to establish such a guideline, we investigate the convergence behavior of the main TDDMRG simulation parameters, such as time integrator, the choice of orbitals, and the choice of matrix-product-state representation for complex-valued non-singlet states. In addition, we propose a method to select orbitals that are tailored to optimize the dynamics. Lastly, we showcase the TDDMRG by applying it to charge migration ionization dynamics in furfural, where we reveal a rapid conversion from an ionized state with a $\sigma$ character to one with a $\pi$ character within less than a femtosecond.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05959'&gt;arXiv:2409.05959&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 09 Sep 2024 18:00:50 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

We provide a comprehensive analysis of recent results in the context of measurement-induced phase transitions (MIPT) in quantum systems, with a particular focus on hybrid quantum circuits as a model system in one-dimension. Recent results, demonstrate how varying the rate of projective measurements can induce phase transitions, resulting in abrupt changes in the properties of the entanglement. The interplay between unitary evolution and measurement processes can be investigated, through mappings to classical statistical models and the application of replica field theory techniques. Starting from a low-entangled state, there can be three regimes characterized by different dynamics of bipartite entanglement entropies for a portion of the system: high-rate measurements leading to rapid entanglement saturation (area law), low-rate measurements allowing linear entanglement growth (up to volume law), and a critical rate at which entanglement grows logarithmically. Finally, we present results on the non-local effects of local measurements by examining the field theory of critical ground states in Tomonaga-Luttinger liquids.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06310'&gt;arXiv:2409.06310&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 10 Sep 2024 08:10:25 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Tensor network Monte Carlo simulations for the two-dimensional random-bond Ising model</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06538</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Tao Chen, Erdong Guo, Wanzhou Zhang, Pan Zhang, Youjin Deng&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Disordered lattice spin systems are crucial in both theoretical and applied physics. However, understanding their properties poses significant challenges for Monte Carlo simulations. In this work, we investigate the two-dimensional random-bond Ising model using the recently proposed Tensor Network Monte Carlo (TNMC) method. This method generates biased samples from conditional probabilities computed via tensor network contractions and corrects the bias using the Metropolis scheme. Consequently, the proposals provided by tensor networks function as block updates for Monte Carlo simulations. Through extensive numerical experiments, we demonstrate that TNMC simulations can be performed on lattices as large as $1024\times 1024$ spins with moderate computational resources, a substantial increase from the previous maximum size of $64\times 64$ in MCMC. Notably, we observe an almost complete absence of critical slowing down, enabling the efficient collection of unbiased samples and averaging over a large number of random realizations of bond disorders. We successfully pinpoint the multi-critical point along the Nishimori line with significant precision and accurately determined the bulk and surface critical exponents. Our findings suggest that TNMC is a highly efficient algorithm for exploring disordered and frustrated systems in two dimensions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06538'&gt;arXiv:2409.06538&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 10 Sep 2024 14:13:33 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Deterministic generation of a 20-qubit two-dimensional photonic cluster state</title>

Muñoz-Arias, Christoph Hellings, Alexander Flasby, Dante Colao Zanuz, Jean-Claude Besse, Alexandre Blais, Daniel Malz, Christopher Eichler, Andreas Wallraff&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Multidimensional cluster states are a key resource for robust quantum communication, measurement-based quantum computing and quantum metrology. Here, we present a device capable of emitting large-scale entangled microwave photonic states in a two dimensional ladder structure. The device consists of a pair of coupled superconducting transmon qubits which are each tuneably coupled to a common output waveguide. This architecture permits entanglement between each transmon and a deterministically emitted photonic qubit. By interleaving two-qubit gates with controlled photon emission, we generate 2 x n grids of time- and frequency-multiplexed cluster states of itinerant microwave photons. We measure a signature of localizable entanglement across up to 20 photonic qubits. We expect the device architecture to be capable of generating a wide range of other tensor network states such as tree graph states, repeater states or the ground state of the toric code, and to be readily scalable to generate larger and higher dimensional states.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06623'&gt;arXiv:2409.06623&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 10 Sep 2024 16:25:24 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Quantum-Train with Tensor Network Mapping Model and Distributed Circuit Ansatz</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06992</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Chen-Yu Liu, Chu-Hsuan Abraham Lin, Kuan-Cheng Chen&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; In the Quantum-Train (QT) framework, mapping quantum state measurements to classical neural network weights is a critical challenge that affects the scalability and efficiency of hybrid quantum-classical models. The traditional QT framework employs a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) for this task, but it struggles with scalability and interpretability. To address these issues, we propose replacing the MLP with a tensor network-based model and introducing a distributed circuit ansatz designed for large-scale quantum machine learning with multiple small quantum processing unit nodes. This approach enhances scalability, efficiently represents high-dimensional data, and maintains a compact model structure. Our enhanced QT framework retains the benefits of reduced parameter count and independence from quantum resources during inference. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the tensor network-based QT framework achieves competitive performance with improved efficiency and generalization, offering a practical solution for scalable hybrid quantum-classical machine learning.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06992'&gt;arXiv:2409.06992&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 11 Sep 2024 03:51:34 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Dynamical Structure Factor from Weak Measurements</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07030</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; E. Altuntas, R. G. Lena, S. Flannigan, A. J. Daley, I. B. Spielman&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Much of our knowledge of quantum systems is encapsulated in the expectation value of Hermitian operators, experimentally obtained by averaging projective measurements. However, dynamical properties are often described by products of operators evaluated at different times; such observables cannot be measured by individual projective measurements, which occur at a single time. For example, the dynamical structure factor describes the propagation of density excitations, such as phonons, and is derived from the spatial density operator evaluated at different times. Conventionally, this is measured by first exciting the system at a specific wavevector and frequency, then measuring the response. Here, we describe an alternative approach using a pair of time-separated weak measurements, and analytically show that their cross-correlation function directly recovers the dynamical structure factor. We provide numerical confirmation of this technique with a matrix product states simulation of the one-dimensional Bose-Hubbard model, weakly measured by phase contrast imaging. We explore the limits of the method and demonstrate its applicability to real experiments with limited imaging resolution.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07030'&gt;arXiv:2409.07030&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 11 Sep 2024 05:57:10 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Variational wavefunction for Mott insulator at finite $U$ using ancilla qubits</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07512</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Boran Zhou, Hui-Ke Jin, Ya-Hui Zhang&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The Mott regime with finite $U$ offers a promising platform for exploring novel phases of matter, such as quantum spin liquids (QSL) that exhibit fractionalization and emergent gauge field. Here, we provide a new class wavefunction, dubbed ancilla wavefunction, to capture both charge and spin (gauge) fluctuations in QSLs at finite $U$. The ancilla wavefunction can unify the Fermi liquid and Mott insulator phases with a single variation parameter $\Phi$ tuning the charge gap. As $\Phi \rightarrow\infty$, the wavefunction reduces to the Gutzwiller projected state, while at $\Phi=U/2$, it is effectively equivalent to applying an inverse Schrieffer-Wolff transformation to the Gutzwiller projected state. This wavefunction can be numerically simulated in the matrix product state representation, and its performance is supported by numerical results for both one- and two-dimensional Hubbard models. Besides, we propose the possibility of a narrow regime of fractional Fermi liquid phase between the usual Fermi liquid and the Mott insulator phases close to the metal insulator transition -- a scenario typically overlooked by the conventional slave rotor theory. Our ancilla wavefunction offers a novel conceptual framework and a powerful numerical tool for understanding Mott physics.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07512'&gt;arXiv:2409.07512&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 11 Sep 2024 18:00:00 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Logarithmically complex rigorous Fourier space solution to the 1D grating diffraction problem</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07821</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Evgeniy Levdik, Alexey A. Shcherbakov&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The rigorous solution to the grating diffraction problem is a cornerstone step in many scientific fields and industrial applications ranging from the study of the fundamental properties of metasurfaces to the simulation of photolithography masks. Fourier space methods, such as the Fourier Modal Method, are established tools for the analysis of the electromagnetic properties of periodic structures, but are too computationally demanding to be directly applied to large and multiscale optical structures. This work focuses on pushing the limits of rigorous computations of periodic electromagnetic structures by adapting a powerful tensor compression technique called the Tensor Train decomposition. We have found that the millions and billions of numbers produced by standard discretization schemes are inherently excessive for storing the information about diffraction problems required for computations with a given accuracy, and we show how to adapt the TT algorithms to have a logarithmically growing amount of information to be sufficient for reliable rigorous solution of the Maxwell's equations on an example of large period multiscale 1D grating structures.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07821'&gt;arXiv:2409.07821&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 12 Sep 2024 08:02:58 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>What is the Relationship between Tensor Factorizations and Circuits (and How Can We Exploit it)?</title>

By connecting these fields, we highlight a series of opportunities that can benefit both communities. Our work generalizes popular tensor factorizations within the circuit language, and unifies various circuit learning algorithms under a single, generalized hierarchical factorization framework. Specifically, we introduce a modular "Lego block" approach to build tensorized circuit architectures. This, in turn, allows us to systematically construct and explore various circuit and tensor factorization models while maintaining tractability. This connection not only clarifies similarities and differences in existing models, but also enables the development of a comprehensive pipeline for building and optimizing new circuit/tensor factorization architectures. We show the effectiveness of our framework through extensive empirical evaluations, and highlight new research opportunities for tensor factorizations in probabilistic modeling.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07953'&gt;arXiv:2409.07953&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 12 Sep 2024 11:32:01 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>A Riemannian Approach to the Lindbladian Dynamics of a Locally Purified Tensor Network</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08127</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Emiliano Godinez-Ramirez, Richard Milbradt, Christian B. Mendl&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Tensor networks offer a valuable framework for implementing Lindbladian dynamics in many-body open quantum systems with nearest-neighbor couplings. In particular, a tensor network ansatz known as the Locally Purified Density Operator employs the local purification of the density matrix to guarantee the positivity of the state at all times. Within this framework, the dissipative evolution utilizes the Trotter-Suzuki splitting, yielding a second-order approximation error. However, due to the Lindbladian dynamics' nature, employing higher-order schemes results in non-physical quantum channels. In this work, we leverage the gauge freedom inherent in the Kraus representation of quantum channels to improve the splitting error. To this end, we formulate an optimization problem on the Riemannian manifold of isometries and find a solution via the second-order trust-region algorithm. We validate our approach using two nearest-neighbor noise models and achieve an improvement of orders of magnitude compared to other positivity-preserving schemes. In addition, we demonstrate the usefulness of our method as a compression scheme, helping to control the exponential growth of computational resources, which thus far has limited the use of the locally purified ansatz.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08127'&gt;arXiv:2409.08127&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 12 Sep 2024 15:16:15 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Hilbert space fragmentation at the origin of disorder-free localization in the lattice Schwinger model</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08320</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Jared Jeyaretnam, Tanmay Bhore, Jesse J. Osborne, Jad C. Halimeh, Zlatko Papić&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Lattice gauge theories, discretized cousins of continuum gauge theories arising in the Standard Model, have become important platforms for exploring non-equilibrium quantum phenomena. Recent works have reported the possibility of disorder-free localization in the lattice Schwinger model. Using degenerate perturbation theory and numerical simulations based on exact diagonalization and matrix product states, we perform a detailed characterization of thermalization breakdown in the Schwinger model, including its spectral properties, structure of eigenstates, and out-of-equilibrium quench dynamics. We scrutinize the strong-coupling limit of the model, in which an intriguing double-logarithmic-in-time growth of entanglement was previously proposed from the initial vacuum state. We identify the origin of this ultraslow growth of entanglement as due to approximate Hilbert space fragmentation and the emergence of a dynamical constraint on particle hopping, which gives rise to sharp jumps in the entanglement entropy dynamics within individual background charge sectors. Based on the statistics of jump times, we argue that entanglement growth, averaged over charge sectors, is more naturally explained as either single-logarithmic or a weak power law in time. Our results suggest the existence of a single ergodicity-breaking regime due to Hilbert space fragmentation, whose properties are reminiscent of conventional many-body localization within numerically accessible system sizes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08320'&gt;arXiv:2409.08320&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 12 Sep 2024 18:00:00 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Spin Seebeck effect of interacting spinons</title>

Starykh&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We present the theory of the longitudinal spin Seebeck effect between a Heisenberg spin-1/2 chain and a conductor. The effect consists of the generation of a spin current across the spin chain-conductor interface in response to the temperature difference between the two systems. In this setup, the current is given by the convolution of the local spin susceptibilities of the spin chain and the conductor. We find the spin current to be fully controlled, both in the magnitude and the sign, by the backscattering interaction between spinons, fractionalized spin excitations of the Heisenberg chain. In particular, it vanishes when the spinons form a non-interacting spinon gas. Our analytical results for the local spin susceptibility at the open end of the spin chain are in excellent agreement with numerical DMRG simulations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08327'&gt;arXiv:2409.08327&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 12 Sep 2024 18:00:04 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Learning Generalized Statistical Mechanics with Matrix Product States</title>

As a result, our model can generate the probability distributions associated with generalized statistical mechanics. The resulting model can be efficiently trained, since the resulting free energy and its gradient can be calculated exactly through tensor network contractions, as opposed to standard methods which require estimating the Gibbs entropy by sampling. We devise a variational annealing scheme by ramping up the inverse temperature, which allows us to train the model while avoiding getting trapped in local minima. We show the validity of our approach in Ising spin-glass problems by comparing it to exact numerical results and quasi-exact analytical approximations. Our work opens up new possibilities for studying generalized statistical physics and solving combinatorial optimization problems with tensor networks.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08352'&gt;arXiv:2409.08352&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 12 Sep 2024 18:30:45 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Efficient Pseudomode Representation and Complexity of Quantum Impurity Models</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08816</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Julian Thoenniss, Ilya Vilkoviskiy, Dmitry A. Abanin&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Out-of-equilibrium fermionic quantum impurity models (QIM), describing a small interacting system coupled to a continuous fermionic bath, play an important role in condensed matter physics. Solving such models is a computationally demanding task, and a variety of computational approaches are based on finding approximate representations of the bath by a finite number of modes. In this paper, we formulate the problem of finding efficient bath representations as that of approximating a kernel of the bath's Feynman-Vernon influence functional by a sum of complex exponentials, with each term defining a fermionic pseudomode. Under mild assumptions on the analytic properties of the bath spectral density, we provide an analytic construction of pseudomodes, and prove that their number scales polylogarithmically with the maximum evolution time $T$ and the approximation error $\varepsilon$. We then demonstrate that the number of pseudomodes can be significantly reduced by an interpolative matrix decomposition (ID). Furthermore, we present a complementary approach, based on constructing rational approximations of the bath's spectral density using the ``AAA'' algorithm, followed by compression with ID. The combination of two approaches yields a pseudomode count scaling as $N_\text{ID} \sim \log(T)\log(1/\varepsilon)$, and the agreement between the two approches suggests that the result is close to optimal. Finally, to relate our findings to QIM, we derive an explicit Liouvillian that describes the time evolution of the combined impurity-pseudomodes system. These results establish bounds on the computational resources required for solving out-of-equilibrium QIMs, providing an efficient starting point for tensor-network methods for QIMs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08816'&gt;arXiv:2409.08816&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 13 Sep 2024 13:31:53 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>The quantum Newman-Moore model in a longitudinal field</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Konstantinos Sfairopoulos, Juan P. Garrahan&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We study the quantum Newman-Moore model, or quantum triangular plaquette model (qTPM), in the presence of a longitudinal field (qTPMz). We present evidence that indicates that the ground state phase diagram of the qTPMz includes various frustrated phases breaking translational symmetries, dependent on the specific sequence of system sizes used to take the large-size limit. This phase diagram includes the known first-order phase transition of the qTPM, but also additional first-order transitions due to the frustrated phases. Using the average longitudinal magnetization as an order parameter, we analyze the magnetization plateaus that characterize the ground state phases, describe their degeneracies, and obtain the qTPMz phase diagram using classical transfer matrix and quantum matrix product state techniques. We identify a region of parameter space which can be effectively described by a Rydberg blockade model on the triangular lattice and also find indications of $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological order connecting the quantum paramagnetic and classical frustrated phases.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09235'&gt;arXiv:2409.09235&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 13 Sep 2024 23:40:21 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Ground State Phase Diagram of $\text{SU}(3)$ $t$-$J$ Chain</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09344</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Junhao Zhang, Jie Hou, Jie Lou, Yan Chen&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Distinct from the $\text{SU}(2)$ case, the fermionic systems with $\text{SU}(N)$ symmetry are expected to exhibit novel physics, such as exotic singlet formation. Using the density matrix renormalization group technique, we obtain the ground state phase diagram of the $\text{SU}(3)$ $t$-$J$ chain for density $n&lt;1$. The ground state phase diagram includes the Luttinger liquid, the extended Luther-Emery liquid characterized by a spin gap, and the phase separation state. We quantitatively assess the characteristics of the three phases by measuring spin gap, compressibility, various correlation functions and structure factors. We further study the extended Luther-Emery liquid phase and discover molecular superfluid quasi-long-range order. The mechanism of the molecular superfluid is the combination of three $\text{SU}(3)$ fermions on sites that are not completely connected. Accordingly, we can speculate the behavior of the $\text{SU}(N)$ $t$-$J$ chain model with larger $N$ values, operating within the same filling regime.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09344'&gt;arXiv:2409.09344&lt;/a&gt;] Published Sat, 14 Sep 2024 07:26:16 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>On the Trainability and Classical Simulability of Learning Matrix Product States Variationally</title>

This ansatz is widely used in quantum machine learning for learning weakly entangled state approximations. Additionally, we empirically demonstrate that in many cases, the objective function is an inner product of almost sparse operators, highlighting the potential for classically simulating such a learning problem with few quantum resources. All our results are experimentally validated across various scenarios.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10055'&gt;arXiv:2409.10055&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 16 Sep 2024 07:35:37 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Full distribution and large deviations of local observables in an exactly solvable current carrying steady state of a strongly driven XXZ chain</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10458</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Sandipan Manna, G J Sreejith&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Current carrying steady states of interacting spin chains exhibit rich structures generated through an interplay of constraints from the Hamiltonian dynamics and those induced by the current. The \textit{XXZ} spin chain when coupled to maximally polarizing Lindblad terms (with opposite signs on either end) admits an exact solution for the steady state in a matrix product state (MPS) form. We use this exact solution to study the correlations and distributions of local spin observables in the nonequilibrium steady state. We present exact expressions for spin correlators, entropy per site and scaled cumulant generating functions (SCGF) for distributions of local observables in the \textit{XX} limit (Ising anisotropy $\Delta=0$). Further, we use the exact MPS solution in the $\Delta&gt;0$ regime, to calculate numerically exact entropy, correlations, as well as full distributions of spin observables in large systems. In systems where $\Delta$ is a cosine of rational multiple of $\pi$, we can numerically exactly estimate the large system limit of the SCGF and the large deviation/rate functions of local-$z$ magnetization. For these, we show that the deviations of the SCGF, calculated in finite systems, from the asymptotic large system size limit decay exponentially with system size; however, the decay rate is a discontinuous function of $\Delta$. The $x$ magnetization density shows a double peak structure at $\Delta\lesssim 1$, suggesting short-range ferromagnetic ordering in the $x$ direction similar to what was reported for the ground state of the XXZ chain.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10458'&gt;arXiv:2409.10458&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 16 Sep 2024 16:49:53 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Duality-preserving deformation of 3+1d lattice $\mathbb Z_2$ gauge theory with exact gapped ground states</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10612</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Pranay Gorantla, Tzu-Chen Huang&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We propose and analyze a deformation of the 3+1d lattice $\mathbb Z_2$ gauge theory that preserves the non-invertible Wegner duality symmetry at the self-dual point. We identify a frustration-free point along this deformation where there are nine exactly degenerate ground states (on a periodic cubic lattice) even at finite volume. One of these ground states is a trivial product state and the rest are the topologically-ordered ground states of the 3+1d toric code. We also prove that the frustration-free point is gapped in the thermodynamic limit. Our model, therefore, realizes a gapped phase with spontaneously broken Wegner duality symmetry. Furthermore, by imposing the Gauss law constraints energetically, all the above features can be realized on a tensor product Hilbert space. Finally, we discuss a generalization of this deformation to the 3+1d lattice $\mathbb Z_N$ gauge theory and conjecture the possible phase diagram.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10612'&gt;arXiv:2409.10612&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 16 Sep 2024 18:00:03 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Charge and spin properties of a generalized Wigner crystal realized in the moiré WSe$_2$/WS$_2$ heterobilayer</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11202</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Andrzej Biborski, Michał Zegrodnik&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We examine the charge and spin properties of an effective single-band model representing a moiré superlattice of the WSe$_{2}$/WS$_{2}$ heterobilayer. We focus on the $2/3$ electron filling, which refers to the formation of a generalized Wigner crystal, as evidenced experimentally. Our approach is based on the extended-Hubbard model on a triangular lattice with non-interacting part effectively describing a spin-split band due to Ising-type spin-orbit coupling. We investigate the system in the regime of strong on-site Coulomb repulsion and the ground state of the Hamiltonian is obtained with the use of the Density Matrix Renormalization Group formulated within the Matrix Product State approach. According to our analysis, based on the density-density correlation functions resolved in the momentum space, a transition from the metallic to the insulating state appears with increasing intersite electron-electron interactions. This transition is identified as being concomitant with the emergence of a generalized Wigner crystal that realizes the honeycomb lattice pattern. We investigate the magnetic properties of such a Wigner crystal state and find that the presence of spin-valley polarization and the increased intersite repulsion induce spin canting of the out-of-plane antiferromagnetic ordering.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11202'&gt;arXiv:2409.11202&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 17 Sep 2024 13:59:14 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Rapid initial state preparation for the quantum simulation of strongly correlated molecules</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11748</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Dominic W. Berry, Yu Tong, Tanuj Khattar, Alec White, Tae In Kim, Sergio Boixo, Lin Lin, Seunghoon Lee, Garnet Kin-Lic Chan, Ryan Babbush, Nicholas C. Rubin&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Studies on quantum algorithms for ground state energy estimation often assume perfect ground state preparation; however, in reality the initial state will have imperfect overlap with the true ground state. Here we address that problem in two ways: by faster preparation of matrix product state (MPS) approximations, and more efficient filtering of the prepared state to find the ground state energy. We show how to achieve unitary synthesis with a Toffoli complexity about $7 \times$ lower than that in prior work, and use that to derive a more efficient MPS preparation method. For filtering we present two different approaches: sampling and binary search. For both we use the theory of window functions to avoid large phase errors and minimise the complexity. We find that the binary search approach provides better scaling with the overlap at the cost of a larger constant factor, such that it will be preferred for overlaps less than about $0.003$. Finally, we estimate the total resources to perform ground state energy estimation of Fe-S cluster systems, including the FeMo cofactor by estimating the overlap of different MPS initial states with potential ground-states of the FeMo cofactor using an extrapolation procedure. {With a modest MPS bond dimension of 4000, our procedure produces an estimate of $\sim 0.9$ overlap squared with a candidate ground-state of the FeMo cofactor, producing a total resource estimate of $7.3 \times 10^{10}$ Toffoli gates; neglecting the search over candidates and assuming the accuracy of the extrapolation, this validates prior estimates that used perfect ground state overlap. This presents an example of a practical path to prepare states of high overlap in a challenging-to-compute chemical system.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11748'&gt;arXiv:2409.11748&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 18 Sep 2024 07:04:32 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Compressing Hamiltonians with ab initio downfolding for simulating strongly-correlated materials on quantum computers</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12237</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Antonios M. Alvertis, Abid Khan, Norm M. Tubman&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The accurate first-principles description of strongly-correlated materials is an important and challenging problem in condensed matter physics. Ab initio downfolding has emerged as a way of deriving compressed many-body Hamiltonians that maintain the essential physics of strongly-correlated materials. The solution of these material-specific models is still exponentially difficult to generate on classical computers, but quantum algorithms allow for a significant speed-up in obtaining the ground states of these compressed Hamiltonians. Here we demonstrate that utilizing quantum algorithms for obtaining the properties of downfolded Hamiltonians can indeed yield high-fidelity solutions. By combining ab initio downfolding and variational quantum eigensolvers, we correctly predict the antiferromagnetic state of one-dimensional cuprate $\text{Ca}_2\text{CuO}_3$, the excitonic ground state of monolayer $\text{WTe}_2$, and the charge-ordered state of correlated metal $\text{SrVO}_3$. Numerical simulations utilizing a classical tensor network implementation of variational quantum eigensolvers allow us to simulate large models with up to $54$ qubits and encompassing up to four bands in the correlated subspace, which is indicative of the complexity that our framework can address. Through these methods we demonstrate the potential of classical pre-optimization and downfolding techniques for enabling efficient materials simulation using quantum algorithms.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12237'&gt;arXiv:2409.12237&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 18 Sep 2024 18:00:04 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Large-scale quantum annealing simulation with tensor networks and belief propagation</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12240</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Ilia A. Luchnikov, Egor S. Tiunov, Tobias Haug, Leandro Aolita&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Quantum annealing and quantum approximate optimization algorithms hold a great potential to speed-up optimization problems. This could be game-changing for a plethora of applications. Yet, in order to hope to beat classical solvers, quantum circuits must scale up to sizes and performances much beyond current hardware. In that quest, intense experimental effort has been recently devoted to optimizations on 3-regular graphs, which are computationally hard but experimentally relatively amenable. However, even there, the amount and quality of quantum resources required for quantum solvers to outperform classical ones is unclear. Here, we show that quantum annealing for 3-regular graphs can be classically simulated even at scales of 1000 qubits and 5000000 two-qubit gates with all-to-all connectivity. To this end, we develop a graph tensor-network quantum annealer (GTQA) able of high-precision simulations of Trotterized circuits of near-adiabatic evolutions. Based on a recently proposed belief-propagation technique for tensor canonicalization, GTQA is equipped with re-gauging and truncation primitives that keep approximation errors small in spite of the circuits generating significant amounts of entanglement. As a result, even with a maximal bond dimension as low as 4, GTQA produces solutions competitive with those of state-of-the-art classical solvers. For non-degenerate instances, the unique solution can be read out from the final reduced single-qubit states. In contrast, for degenerate problems, such as MaxCut, we introduce an approximate measurement simulation algorithm for graph tensor-network states. On one hand, our findings showcase the potential of GTQA as a powerful quantum-inspired optimizer. On the other hand, they considerably raise the bar required for experimental demonstrations of quantum speed-ups in combinatorial optimizations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12240'&gt;arXiv:2409.12240&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 18 Sep 2024 18:00:08 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Eiji Konishi&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; In this article, we approach the structure of the quantum measuring system in the Euclidean regime of the classicalized holographic tensor network from the perspective of integrated information theory. As a result, we obtain the following picture of the Euclidean regime. First, there are complexes, which are independently accompanied by the level and structure of experiences, determined from the full transition probability matrix of the whole particle system. Second, the cause-effect structures of independent complexes would be directly entangled by the physical information propagation in the whole particle system. Finally, distinct full transition probability matrices of the whole particle system that exhibit the maximum cause-effect power may coexist.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12322'&gt;arXiv:2409.12322&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 18 Sep 2024 21:30:20 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Frustrated spin-1/2 Heisenberg model on a Kagome-strip chain: Dimerization and mapping to a spin-orbital Kugel-Khomskii model</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12530</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Sayan Ghosh, Rajiv R. P. Singh, Manoranjan Kumar&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We investigate the quantum phases of a frustrated antiferromagnetic Heisenberg spin-1/2 model Hamiltonian on a Kagome-strip chain (KSC), a one-dimensional analogue of the Kagome lattice, and construct its phase diagram in an extended exchange parameter space. The isolated unit cell of this lattice comprises of five spin-1/2 particles, giving rise to several types of magnetic ground states in a unit cell: a spin-$3/2$ state as well as spin-$1/2$ states with and without additional degeneracies. We explore the ground state properties of the fully connected thermodynamic system using exact diagonalization and density matrix renormalization group methods, identifying several distinct quantum phases. All but one of the phases exhibit gapless spin excitations. The exception is a dimerized spin-gapped phase that covers a large part of the phase diagram and includes the uniformly exchange coupled system. We argue that this phase can be understood by perturbing around the limit of decoupled unit cells where each unit cell has six degenerate ground states. We use degenerate perturbation theory to obtain an effective Hamiltonian, a Kugel-Khomskii model with an anisotropic spin-one orbital degree of freedom, which helps explain the origin of dimerization.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12530'&gt;arXiv:2409.12530&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 19 Sep 2024 07:48:57 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

We contrast the widely used topological entanglement entropy with a recently introduced operational definition for topological order based on error correction properties, finding exponential scaling with the system size for the former and polynomial scaling for the latter. We exemplify our approach for a variant of the paradigmatic toric code model with mobile particles, finding that the error correction method allows to treat substantially larger system sizes. In particular, the phase diagram of the model can be successfully computed using error correction, while the topological entanglement entropy is too severely limited by finite size effects to obtain conclusive results. While we mainly focus on one-dimensional systems whose ground states can be expressed in terms of matrix product states, our strategy can be readily generalized to higher dimensions and systems out of equilibrium, even allowing for an efficient detection of topological order in current quantum simulation experiments.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12704'&gt;arXiv:2409.12704&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 19 Sep 2024 12:30:27 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Enhanced Krylov Methods for Molecular Hamiltonians: Reduced Memory Cost and Complexity Scaling via Tensor Hypercontraction</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Yu Wang, Maxine Luo, Matthias Reumann, Christian B. Mendl&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We introduce an algorithm that is simultaneously memory-efficient and low-scaling for applying ab initio molecular Hamiltonians to matrix-product states (MPS) via the tensor-hypercontraction (THC) format. These gains carry over to Krylov subspace methods, which can find low-lying eigenstates and simulate quantum time evolution while avoiding local minima and maintaining high accuracy. In our approach, the molecular Hamiltonian is represented as a sum of products of four MPOs, each with a bond dimension of only 2. Iteratively applying the MPOs to the current quantum state in MPS form, summing and re-compressing the MPS leads to a scheme with the same asymptotic memory cost as the bare MPS and reduces the computational cost scaling compared to the Krylov method using a conventional MPO construction. We provide a detailed theoretical derivation of these statements and conduct supporting numerical experiments to demonstrate the advantage. Our algorithm is highly parallelizable and thus lends itself to large-scale HPC simulations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12708'&gt;arXiv:2409.12708&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 19 Sep 2024 12:34:06 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

They have recently extended to quantum and classical machine learning, providing a basis for representing quantum states via neural networks. These methods generally aim to minimize the energy of a given ansätz, though open questions remain about the expressivity of quantum and classical variational ansätze. The connection between variational techniques and quantum computing, through variational quantum algorithms, offers opportunities to explore the quantum complexity of classical methods. We demonstrate how the concept of non-stabilizerness, or magic, can create a bridge between quantum information and variational techniques and we show that energy accuracy is a necessary but not always sufficient condition for accuracy in non-stabilizerness. Through systematic benchmarking of neural network quantum states, matrix product states, and variational quantum methods, we show that while classical techniques are more accurate in non-stabilizerness, not accounting for the symmetries of the system can have a severe impact on this accuracy. Our findings form a basis for a universal expressivity characterization of both quantum and classical variational methods.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13008'&gt;arXiv:2409.13008&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 19 Sep 2024 18:00:00 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Entanglement Negativity and Replica Symmetry Breaking in General Holographic States</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13009</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Xi Dong, Jonah Kudler-Flam, Pratik Rath&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The entanglement negativity $\mathcal{E}(A:B)$ is a useful measure of quantum entanglement in bipartite mixed states. In random tensor networks (RTNs), which are related to fixed-area states, it was found in [arXiv:2101.11029] that the dominant saddles computing the even Rényi negativity $\mathcal{E}^{(2k)}$ generically break the $\mathbb{Z}_{2k}$ replica symmetry. This calls into question previous calculations of holographic negativity using 2D CFT techniques that assumed $\mathbb{Z}_{2k}$ replica symmetry and proposed that the negativity was related to the entanglement wedge cross section. In this paper, we resolve this issue by showing that in general holographic states, the saddles computing $\mathcal{E}^{(2k)}$ indeed break the $\mathbb{Z}_{2k}$ replica symmetry. Our argument involves an identity relating $\mathcal{E}^{(2k)}$ to the $k$-th Rényi entropy on subregion $AB^*$ in the doubled state $|{\rho_{AB}}\rangle_{AA^*BB^*}$, from which we see that the $\mathbb{Z}_{2k}$ replica symmetry is broken down to $\mathbb{Z}_{k}$. For $k&lt;1$, which includes the case of $\mathcal{E}(A:B)$ at $k=1/2$, we use a modified cosmic brane proposal to derive a new holographic prescription for $\mathcal{E}^{(2k)}$ and show that it is given by a new saddle with multiple cosmic branes anchored to subregions $A$ and $B$ in the original state. Using our prescription, we reproduce known results for the PSSY model and show that our saddle dominates over previously proposed CFT calculations near $k=1$. Moreover, we argue that the $\mathbb{Z}_{2k}$ symmetric configurations previously proposed are not gravitational saddles, unlike our proposal. Finally, we contrast holographic calculations with those arising from RTNs with non-maximally entangled links, demonstrating that the qualitative form of backreaction in such RTNs is different from that in gravity.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13009'&gt;arXiv:2409.13009&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 19 Sep 2024 18:00:00 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

For a particular RG map (Gilt-TNR) we studied the spectrum of the Jacobian of the RG map at the fixed point and found good agreement between the eigenvalues corresponding to relevant and marginal operators and their known exact values. In this companion work we use two further methods to extract many more scaling dimensions from this Newton method fixed point, and compare the numerical results with the predictions of conformal field theory (CFT). The first method is the well-known transfer matrix (TM), while the second method we refer to as the lattice dilatation operator (LDO). We introduce some extensions of these method that provide also spins of the CFT operators, modulo an integer. With comparable computing resources, the TM and LDO methods perform equally well. The agreement for the scaling dimensions and spins is excellent up to the scaling dimesnion 4.125, and reasonably good up to 2 units higher. Some of the eigenvalues of the Jacobian of the RG map can come from perturbations associated with total derivative interactions and so are not universal. In some past studies (arXiv:2102.08136, arXiv:2305.09899) such non-universal eigenvalues did not appear in the Jacobian. We explain this surprising result by showing that their RG map has the unusual property that the Jacobian is equivalent to the LDO operator.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13012'&gt;arXiv:2409.13012&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 19 Sep 2024 18:00:01 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Anticoncentration and state design of random tensor networks</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13023</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Guglielmo Lami, Jacopo De Nardis, Xhek Turkeshi&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We investigate quantum random tensor network states where the bond dimensions scale polynomially with the system size, $N$. Specifically, we examine the delocalization properties of random Matrix Product States (RMPS) in the computational basis by deriving an exact analytical expression for the Inverse Participation Ratio (IPR) of any degree, applicable to both open and closed boundary conditions. For bond dimensions $\chi \sim \gamma N$, we determine the leading order of the associated overlaps probability distribution and demonstrate its convergence to the Porter-Thomas distribution, characteristic of Haar-random states, as $\gamma$ increases. Additionally, we provide numerical evidence for the frame potential, measuring the $2$-distance from the Haar ensemble, which confirms the convergence of random MPS to Haar-like behavior for $\chi \gg \sqrt{N}$. We extend this analysis to two-dimensional systems using random Projected Entangled Pair States (PEPS), where we similarly observe the convergence of IPRs to their Haar values for $\chi \gg \sqrt{N}$. These findings demonstrate that random tensor networks with bond dimensions scaling polynomially in the system size are fully Haar-anticoncentrated and approximate unitary designs, regardless of the spatial dimension.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13023'&gt;arXiv:2409.13023&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 19 Sep 2024 18:00:28 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Structural transition, spontaneous formation of strong singlet dimers and metamagnetism in $S=3/2$ magnetoelastic spin chains</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13446</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; C. J. Gazza, A. A. Aligia, A. O. Dobry, G. L. Rossini, D. C. Cabra&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We study a one-dimensional antiferromagnetic-elastic model with magnetic ions having spin $S=3/2$. By extensive DMRG computations and complementary analytical methods, we uncover a first-order transition from a homogeneous or weakly-dimerized phase (a situation that could be similar to the well known $S=1/2$ spin-Peierls effect) to a highly distorted phase, driven by the spin-phonon coupling $\lambda$. The striking characteristic of the second phase, present at large $\lambda$, is the appearance of weakly ferromagnetic (FM) couplings alternating with strong antiferromagnetic (AFM) ones (we dub it FM-AFM phase) with a ground state close to a direct-product state of singlet dimers sitting on the AFM bonds. The behavior of the spin gap in both phases is studied by DMRG computation and contrasted with bosonization predictions and perturbation theory around the direct product of dimers. In the FM-AFM phase robust magnetization plateaus and metamagnetic jumps show under magnetic fields. The novel phase could be realized in 5d oxides of current interest, with giant spin-phonon coupling. Potential applications of the transition would be associated to the possibility of tuning the transition by external parameters such as striction, magnetic or electric fields, or alloying.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13446'&gt;arXiv:2409.13446&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 20 Sep 2024 12:27:57 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Pauli weight requirement of the matrix elements in time-evolved local operators: dependence beyond the equilibration temperature</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13603</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Carlos Ramos-Marimón, Stefano Carignano, Luca Tagliacozzo&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The complexity of simulating the out-of-equilibrium evolution of local operators in the Heisenberg picture is governed by the operator entanglement, which grows linearly in time for generic non-integrable systems, leading to an exponential increase in computational resources. A promising approach to simplify this challenge involves discarding parts of the operator and focusing on a subspace formed by "light" Pauli strings - strings with few Pauli matrices - as proposed by Rakovszki et al. [PRB 105, 075131 (2022)]. In this work, we investigate whether this strategy can be applied to quenches starting from homogeneous product states. For ergodic dynamics, these initial states grant access to a wide range of equilibration temperatures. By concentrating on the desired matrix elements and retaining only the portion of the operator that contains Pauli strings parallel to the initial state, we uncover a complex scenario. In some cases, the light Pauli strings suffice to describe the dynamics, enabling efficient simulation with current algorithms. However, in other cases, heavier strings become necessary, pushing computational demands beyond our current capabilities. We analyze this behavior using a newly introduced measure of complexity, the Operator Weight Entropy, which we compute for different operators across most points on the Bloch sphere.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13603'&gt;arXiv:2409.13603&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 20 Sep 2024 16:02:19 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Bose-Fermi $N$-polaron state emergence from correlation-mediated blocking of phase separation</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Felipe Gómez-Lozada, Hoshu Hiyane, Thomas Busch, Thomás Fogarty&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We study $N$ fermionic impurities in a one-dimensional lattice bosonic bath at unit filling. Using DMRG and mixed boundary conditions-periodic for bosons, open for fermions -- we find an $N$-polaron ground state replacing phase separation at high interspecies repulsion. This tightly bound state of clustered particles emerges due to strong impurity-bath correlations, which induce large impurity-impurity correlations that we quantify via the von Neumann entropy and bipartite mutual information, respectively. This system also reveals a fermionic self-localization effect from a Mott insulator background due to local correlations between the impurities and the bath. The growth of long-range correlations breaks this Mott phase, resulting in the transition to impurity clusters delocalized along the system. Finally, we show that there is a critical impurity number, which depends on intraspecies bosonic interaction, beyond which phase separation is recovered.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13785'&gt;arXiv:2409.13785&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 20 Sep 2024 04:05:15 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Dynamically generated concatenated codes and their phase diagrams</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Grace M. Sommers, David A. Huse, Michael J. Gullans&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We formulate code concatenation as the action of a unitary quantum circuit on an expanding tree geometry and find that for certain classes of gates, applied identically at each node, a binary tree circuit encodes a single logical qubit with code distance that grows exponentially in the depth of the tree. When there is noise in the bulk or at the end of this encoding circuit, the system undergoes a phase transition between a coding phase, where an optimal decoder can successfully recover logical information, and a non-coding phase. Leveraging the tree structure, we combine the formalism of "tensor enumerators" from quantum coding theory with standard recursive techniques for classical spin models on the Bethe lattice to explore these phases. In the presence of bulk errors, the coding phase is a type of spin glass, characterized by a distribution of failure probabilities. When the errors are heralded, the recursion relation is exactly solvable, giving us an analytic handle on the phase diagram.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13801'&gt;arXiv:2409.13801&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 20 Sep 2024 17:51:50 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Probing Celestial Energy and Charge Correlations through Real-Time Quantum Simulations: Insights from the Schwinger Model</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; João Barata, Swagato Mukherjee&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Motivated by recent developments in the application of light-ray operators (LROs) in high energy physics, we propose a new strategy to study correlation functions of LROs through real-time quantum simulations. We argue that quantum simulators provide an ideal laboratory to explore the properties LROs in lower-dimensional quantum field theories (QFTs). This is exemplified in the 1+1-d Schwinger model, employing tensor network methods, focusing on the calculation of energy and charge correlators. Despite some challenges in extracting the necessary correlation functions from the lattice the methodology used can be extended to real quantum devices.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13816'&gt;arXiv:2409.13816&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 20 Sep 2024 18:00:07 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>A coherent approach to quantum-classical optimization</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13924</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Andrés N. Cáliz, Jordi Riu, Josep Bosch, Pau Torrente, Jose Miralles, Arnau Riera&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Hybrid quantum-classical optimization techniques, which incorporate the pre-optimization of Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) using Tensor Networks (TNs), have been shown to allow for the reduction of quantum computational resources. In the particular case of large optimization problems, commonly found in real-world use cases, this strategy is almost mandatory to reduce the otherwise unfathomable execution costs and improve the quality of the results. We identify the coherence entropy as a crucial metric in determining the suitability of quantum states as effective initialization candidates. Our findings are validated through extensive numerical tests for the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA), in which we find that the optimal initialization states are pure Gibbs states. Further, these results are explained with the inclusion of a simple and yet novel notion of expressivity adapted to classical optimization problems. Based on this finding, we propose a quantum-classical optimization protocol that significantly improves on previous approaches for such tasks, with specific focus on its effectiveness.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13924'&gt;arXiv:2409.13924&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 20 Sep 2024 22:22:53 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Signature of preformed pairs in angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14490</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Klemen Kovač, Alberto Nocera, Andrea Damascelli, Janez Bonča, Mona Berciu&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We use density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) and variational exact diagonalization (VED) to calculate the single-electron removal spectral weight for the Hubbard-Holstein model at low electron densities. Tuning the strength of the electron-phonon coupling and of the Hubbard repulsion allows us to contrast the results for a liquid of polarons versus a liquid of bipolarons. The former shows spectral weight up to the Fermi energy, as expected for a metal. The latter has a gap in its spectral weight, set by the bipolaron binding energy, although this is also a (strongly correlated) metal. This difference suggests that angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy could be used to identify liquids of pre-formed pairs. Furthermore, we show that the one-dimensional liquid of incoherent bipolarons is well approximated by a "Bose sea" of bosons that are hard-core in momentum space, occupying the momenta inside the Fermi sea but otherwise non-interacting. This new proposal for a strongly-correlated many-body wavefunction opens the way for studying various other properties of incoherent (non-superconducting) liquids of pre-formed pairs in any dimension.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14490'&gt;arXiv:2409.14490&lt;/a&gt;] Published Sun, 22 Sep 2024 15:27:24 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Simulating Schwinger model dynamics with quasi-one-dimensional qubit arrays</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14544</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Alessio Lerose&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Real-time dynamics of the Schwinger model provide an effective description of quark confinement out of equilibrium, routinely employed to model hadronization processes in particle-physics event generators. Ab-initio simulations of such non-perturbative processes are far beyond the reach of existing computational tools, and remain an outstanding open quest for quantum simulators to date. In this work we develop a general strategy to run Schwinger model dynamics on synthetic quantum spin lattices, such as neutral-atom or superconducting-qubit arrays. Our construction encodes the constrained fermionic and bosonic degrees of freedom of the model into the geometric shape of a magnetic interface. We show that global magnetic field patterns can drive coherent quantum dynamics of the interface equivalent to the lattice Schwinger Hamiltonian. We rigorously establish that the optimal array required for simulating real-time wave packet collisions and string fragmentation processes with accuracy $\epsilon$ in the continuum field-theory limit, is a quasi-one-dimensional ribbon with polynomial length and polylogarithmic width in $\epsilon^{-1}$. We finally discuss a concrete advantageous implementation using a state-of-the-art dual-species Rydberg atom array. This work opens up a path for near-term quantum simulators to address questions of immediate relevance to particle physics.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14544'&gt;arXiv:2409.14544&lt;/a&gt;] Published Sun, 22 Sep 2024 17:58:25 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Tuning competition between charge order and superconductivity in the square-lattice $t$-$t'$-$J$ model</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15270</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Xin Lu, Huaiming Guo, Wei-Qiang Chen, D. N. Sheng, Shou-Shu Gong&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Recently, a flurry of works have found strong competition between charge density wave (CDW) and superconductivity (SC) in the doped Hubbard and $t$-$J$ models on the square lattice. Interestingly, some recent results suggest that the electron-phonon coupling may suppress CDW order and enhance SC. In this work, we consider the square-lattice Hubbard model with the Holstein or Su-Schrieffer-Heeger electron-phonon coupling at the large-$U$ and antiadiabatic (infinite phonon frequency) limit, which gives an effective $t$-$J$ model with either a density attractive interaction $V$ or a $J_P$ term that contributes a larger spin exchange and a density repulsive interaction. To explore how these effective couplings may suppress CDW and give a SC, we implement the density matrix renormalization group simulation on the $t$-$t'$-$J$ model with $V$ or $J_P$ coupling. We focus on the {\it six-leg} cylinder system with the next-nearest-neighbor hopping $t'$, which hosts partially filled stripe and $d$-wave SC in phase diagram. By tuning $t'/t &gt; 0$ and $V$ or $J_P$, we establish two quantum phase diagrams. In the SC phases, the increased $V$ or $J_P$ coupling can enhance the quasi-long-range SC order, consistent with some previous findings. Nonetheless, no SC emerges when the partially filled stripe phase disappears with increased $V$ or $J_P$. Instead, the system has a transition to either a phase-separation-like regime or a filled stripe phase. On the other hand, with increased $t'/t$, not only the partially filled stripe but the phase separation and filled stripe can also be tuned to SC phase. Our results suggest that although $V$ and $J_P$ couplings may strengthen hole binding, the hole dynamics controlled by $t'/t$ appears to play more crucial role for obtaining a SC in $t$-$J$ model.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15270'&gt;arXiv:2409.15270&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 23 Sep 2024 17:58:59 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Interaction dependence of the Hall response for the Bose-Hubbard triangular ladder</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Catalin-Mihai Halati, Thierry Giamarchi&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We explore the behavior of the Hall response of a Bose-Hubbard triangular ladder in a magnetic field as a function of the repulsive on-site atomic interactions. We consider a wide range of interaction strengths, from the weakly interacting limit to the hardcore regime. This is realized by computing the Hall polarization following the quench of a weak linear potential which induces the flow of a current through the system, using time-dependent matrix product state numerical simulations. We complement our understanding in the regime of small magnetic fields by analytical calculations of the equilibrium value of the Hall polarization for non-interacting bosonic atoms, or under a mean-field assumption. The Bose-Hubbard triangular flux ladder exhibits a rich phase diagram, containing Meissner, vortex and biased-chiral superfluid phases. We show that the Hall response can be employed to fingerprint the various chiral state, the frustration effects occurring in the limit of strong interactions, and the phase boundaries of the equilibrium phase diagram.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15276'&gt;arXiv:2409.15276&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 23 Sep 2024 17:59:32 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Quantum-interference-induced pairing in antiferromagnetic bosonic $t$-$J$ model</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15424</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Hao-Kai Zhang, Jia-Xin Zhang, Ji-Si Xu, Zheng-Yu Weng&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The pairing mechanism in an antiferromagnetic (AFM) bosonic $t$-$J$ model is investigated via large-scale density matrix renormalization group calculations. In contrast to the competing orders in the fermionic $t$-$J$ model, we discover that a pair density wave (PDW) of tightly bound hole pairs coexists with the AFM order forming a ``supersolid'' at small doping in the bosonic model. The pairing order collapses at larger doping to a superfluid of single-boson condensation with the spin background polarized to a ferromagnetic (FM) order simultaneously. This pairing phase will disappear once a hidden quantum many-body Berry phase in the model is artificially switched off. Such a Berry phase, termed the phase string, introduces the sole ``sign problem'' in this bosonic model and imposes quantum phase frustration in the interference pattern between spin and charge degrees of freedom. Only via tightly pairing of doped holes, can such quantum frustration be most effectively erased in an AFM background. By contrast, the pairing vanishes as such a Berry phase trivializes in an FM background or is switched off by a sign-problem-free model (the Bose-Hubbard model at large $U$). The pairing mechanism proposed here is inherently quantum and many-body, stemming from exotic interference patterns caused by strong correlation effects, which is distinct from the semi-classical mechanisms based on bosonic fluctuations. Experimental schemes have been recently proposed to realize the bosonic $t$-$J$ model on ultracold Rydberg atom arrays, offering a useful platform to test the present unconventional pairing mechanism, which is also relevant to the fermionic case associated with high-temperature superconductors.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15424'&gt;arXiv:2409.15424&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 23 Sep 2024 18:00:04 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Spectral Gap Optimization for Enhanced Adiabatic State Preparation</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Kshiti Sneh Rai, Jin-Fu Chen, Patrick Emonts, Jordi Tura&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The preparation of non-trivial states is crucial to the study of quantum many-body physics. Such states can be prepared with adiabatic quantum algorithms, which are restricted by the minimum spectral gap along the path. In this letter, we propose an efficient method to adiabatically prepare tensor networks states (TNSs). We maximize the spectral gap leveraging degrees of freedom in the parent Hamiltonian construction. We demonstrate this efficient adiabatic algorithm for preparing TNS, through examples of random TNS in one dimension, AKLT, and GHZ states. The Hamiltonian optimization applies to both injective and non-injective tensors, in the latter case by exploiting symmetries present in the tensors.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15433'&gt;arXiv:2409.15433&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 23 Sep 2024 18:00:32 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Ultra-low latency quantum-inspired machine learning predictors implemented on FPGA</title>

Recent works have shown how TNs can also be applied to perform Machine Learning (ML) tasks, yielding comparable results to standard supervised learning techniques. In this work, we study the use of Tree Tensor Networks (TTNs) in high-frequency real-time applications by exploiting the low-latency hardware of the Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) technology. We present different implementations of TTN classifiers, capable of performing inference on classical ML datasets as well as on complex physics data. A preparatory analysis of bond dimensions and weight quantization is realized in the training phase, together with entanglement entropy and correlation measurements, that help setting the choice of the TTN architecture. The generated TTNs are then deployed on a hardware accelerator; using an FPGA integrated into a server, the inference of the TTN is completely offloaded. Eventually, a classifier for High Energy Physics (HEP) applications is implemented and executed fully pipelined with sub-microsecond latency.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16075'&gt;arXiv:2409.16075&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 24 Sep 2024 13:21:21 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Scalable quantum dynamics compilation via quantum machine learning</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Yuxuan Zhang, Roeland Wiersema, Juan Carrasquilla, Lukasz Cincio, Yong Baek Kim&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Quantum dynamics compilation is an important task for improving quantum simulation efficiency: It aims to synthesize multi-qubit target dynamics into a circuit consisting of as few elementary gates as possible. Compared to deterministic methods such as Trotterization, variational quantum compilation (VQC) methods employ variational optimization to reduce gate costs while maintaining high accuracy. In this work, we explore the potential of a VQC scheme by making use of out-of-distribution generalization results in quantum machine learning (QML): By learning the action of a given many-body dynamics on a small data set of product states, we can obtain a unitary circuit that generalizes to highly entangled states such as the Haar random states. The efficiency in training allows us to use tensor network methods to compress such time-evolved product states by exploiting their low entanglement features. Our approach exceeds state-of-the-art compilation results in both system size and accuracy in one dimension ($1$D). For the first time, we extend VQC to systems on two-dimensional (2D) strips with a quasi-1D treatment, demonstrating a significant resource advantage over standard Trotterization methods, highlighting the method's promise for advancing quantum simulation tasks on near-term quantum processors.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16346'&gt;arXiv:2409.16346&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 24 Sep 2024 18:00:00 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Deep Circuit Compression for Quantum Dynamics via Tensor Networks</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16361</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Joe Gibbs, Lukasz Cincio&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Dynamic quantum simulation is a leading application for achieving quantum advantage. However, high circuit depths remain a limiting factor on near-term quantum hardware. We present a compilation algorithm based on Matrix Product Operators for generating compressed circuits enabling real-time simulation on digital quantum computers, that for a given depth are more accurate than all Trotterizations of the same depth. By the efficient use of environment tensors, the algorithm is scalable in depth beyond prior work, and we present circuit compilations of up to 64 layers of $SU(4)$ gates. Surpassing only 1D circuits, our approach can flexibly target a particular quasi-2D gate topology. We demonstrate this by compiling a 52-qubit 2D Transverse-Field Ising propagator onto the IBM Heavy-Hex topology. For all circuit depths and widths tested, we produce circuits with smaller errors than all equivalent depth Trotter unitaries, corresponding to reductions in error by up to 4 orders of magnitude and circuit depth compressions with a factor of over 6.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16361'&gt;arXiv:2409.16361&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 24 Sep 2024 18:00:05 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Non-stabilizerness Entanglement Entropy: a measure of hardness in the classical simulation of quantum many-body systems</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16895</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Jiale Huang, Xiangjian Qian, Mingpu Qin&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Classical and quantum states can be distinguished by entanglement entropy, which can be viewed as a measure of quantum resources. Entanglement entropy also plays a pivotal role in understanding computational complexity in simulating quantum systems. However, stabilizer states formed solely by Clifford gates can be efficiently simulated with the tableau algorithm according to the Gottesman-Knill theorem, although they can host large entanglement entropy. In this work, we introduce the concept of non-stabilizerness entanglement entropy which is basically the minimum residual entanglement entropy for a quantum state by excluding the contribution from Clifford circuits. It can serve as a new practical and better measure of difficulty in the classical simulation of quantum many-body systems. We discuss why it is a better criterion than previously proposed metrics such as Stabilizer Rényi Entropy. We also show numerical results of non-stabilizerness entanglement entropy with concrete quantum many-body models. The concept of non-stabilizerness entanglement entropy expands our understanding of the ``hardness`` in the classical simulation of quantum many-body systems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16895'&gt;arXiv:2409.16895&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 25 Sep 2024 13:06:04 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Extracting Dynamical Maps of Non-Markovian Open Quantum Systems</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17051</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; David J. Strachan, Archak Purkayastha, Stephen R. Clark&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The most general description of quantum evolution up to a time $\tau$ is a completely positive tracing preserving map known as a dynamical map $\hat{\Lambda}(\tau)$. Here we consider $\hat{\Lambda}(\tau)$ arising from suddenly coupling a system to one or more thermal baths with a strength that is neither weak nor strong. Given no clear separation of characteristic system/bath time scales $\hat{\Lambda}(\tau)$ is generically expected to be non-Markovian, however we do assume the ensuing dynamics has a unique steady state implying the baths possess a finite memory time $\tau_{\rm m}$. By combining several techniques within a tensor network framework we directly and accurately extract $\hat{\Lambda}(\tau)$ for a small number of interacting fermionic modes coupled to infinite non-interacting Fermi baths. We employ the Choi-Jamiolkowski isomorphism so that $\hat{\Lambda}(\tau)$ can be fully reconstructed from a single pure state calculation of the unitary dynamics of the system, bath and their replica auxillary modes up to time $\tau$. From $\hat{\Lambda}(\tau)$ we also compute the time local propagator $\hat{\mathcal{L}}(\tau)$. By examining the convergence with $\tau$ of the instantaneous fixed points of these objects we establish their respective memory times $\tau^{\Lambda}_{\rm m}$ and $\tau^{\mathcal{L}}_{\rm m}$. Beyond these times, the propagator $\hat{\mathcal{L}}(\tau)$ and dynamical map $\hat{\Lambda}(\tau)$ accurately describe all the subsequent long-time relaxation dynamics up to stationarity. Our numerical examples of interacting spinless Fermi chains and the single impurity Anderson model demonstrate regimes where our approach can offer a significant speedup in determining the stationary state compared to directly simulating the long-time limit.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17051'&gt;arXiv:2409.17051&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 25 Sep 2024 16:09:03 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Pei-Yun Yang, Yu-Chin Tzeng&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Quantum entanglement plays a crucial role not only in understanding Hermitian many-body systems but also in offering valuable insights into non-Hermitian quantum systems. In this paper, we analytically investigate the entanglement Hamiltonian and entanglement energy spectrum of a non-Hermitian spin ladder using perturbation theory in the biorthogonal basis. Specifically, we examine the entanglement properties between coupled non-Hermitian quantum spin chains. In the strong coupling limit ($J_\mathrm{rung}\gg1$), first-order perturbation theory reveals that the entanglement Hamiltonian closely resembles the single-chain Hamiltonian with renormalized coupling strengths, allowing for the definition of an ad hoc temperature. Our findings provide new insights into quantum entanglement in non-Hermitian systems and offer a foundation for developing novel approaches for studying finite temperature properties in non-Hermitian quantum many-body systems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17062'&gt;arXiv:2409.17062&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 25 Sep 2024 16:20:24 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Topological zero modes and correlation pumping in an engineered Kondo lattice</title>

Lado, Guangze Chen&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Topological phases of matter provide a flexible platform to engineer unconventional quantum excitations in quantum materials. Beyond single particle topological matter, in systems with strong quantum many-body correlations, many-body effects can be the driving force for non-trivial topology. Here, we propose a one-dimensional engineered Kondo lattice where the emergence of topological excitations is driven by collective many-body Kondo physics. We first show the existence of topological zero modes in this system by solving the interacting model with tensor networks, and demonstrate their robustness against disorder. To unveil the origin of the topological zero modes, we analyze the associated periodic Anderson model showing that it can be mapped to a topological non-Hermitian model, enabling rationalizing the origin of the topological zero modes. We finally show that the topological invariant of the many-body Kondo lattice can be computed with a correlation matrix pumping method directly with the exact quantum many-body wavefunction. Our results provide a strategy to engineer topological Kondo insulators, highlighting quantum magnetism as a driving force in engineering topological matter.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17202'&gt;arXiv:2409.17202&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 25 Sep 2024 15:12:48 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Hopf algebras and solvable unitary circuits</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17215</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Zhiyuan Wang&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Exactly solvable models in quantum many body dynamics provide valuable insights into many interesting physical phenomena, and serve as platforms to rigorously investigate fundamental theoretical questions. Nevertheless, they are extremely rare and existing solvable models and solution techniques have serious limitations. In this paper we introduce a new family of exactly solvable unitary circuits which model quantum many body dynamics in discrete space and time. Unlike many previous solvable models, one can exactly compute the full quantum dynamics initialized from any matrix product state in this new family of models. The time evolution of local observables and correlations, the linear growth of Renyi entanglement entropy, spatiotemporal correlations, and out-of-time-order correlations are all exactly computable. A key property of these models enabling the exact solution is that any time evolved local operator is an exact matrix product operator with finite bond dimension, even at arbitrarily long time, which we prove using the underlying (weak) Hopf algebra structure along with tensor network techniques. We lay down the general framework for the construction and solution of this family of models, and give several explicit examples. In particular, we study in detail a model constructed out of a weak Hopf algebra that is very close to a floquet version of the PXP model, and the exact results we obtain may shed light on the phenomenon of quantum many body scars, and more generally, floquet quantum dynamics in constrained systems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17215'&gt;arXiv:2409.17215&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 25 Sep 2024 17:54:19 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Reflected entropy in random tensor networks III: triway cuts</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Chris Akers, Thomas Faulkner, Simon Lin, Pratik Rath&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; For general random tensor network states at large bond dimension, we prove that the integer Rényi reflected entropies (away from phase transitions) are determined by minimal triway cuts through the network. This generalizes the minimal cut description of bipartite entanglement for these states. A natural extrapolation away from integer Rényi parameters, suggested by the triway cut problem, implies the holographic conjecture $S_R=2EW$, where $S_R$ is the reflected entropy and $EW$ is the entanglement wedge cross-section. Minimal triway cuts can be formulated as integer programs which cannot be relaxed to find a dual maximal flow/bit-thread description. This sheds light on the gap between the existence of tripartite entanglement in holographic states and the bipartite entanglement structure motivated by bit-threads. In particular, we prove that the Markov gap that measures tripartite entanglement is lower bounded by the integrality gap of the integer program that computes the triway cut.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17218'&gt;arXiv:2409.17218&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 25 Sep 2024 18:00:00 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Hyaline Junhe Chen, Jonah Kudler-Flam&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We investigate details of the chaotic dynamics of dual-unitary quantum circuits by evaluating all $2k$-point out-of-time-ordered correlators. For the generic class of circuits, by writing the correlators as contractions of a class of quantum channels, we prove their exponential decay. This implies that local operators separated in time approach free independence. Along the way, we develop a replica trick for dual-unitary circuits, which may be useful and of interest in its own right. We classify the relevant eigenstates of the replica transfer matrix by paths in the lattice of noncrossing partitions, combinatorial objects central to free probability theory. Interestingly, the noncrossing lattice emerges even for systems without randomness and with small onsite Hilbert space dimension.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17226'&gt;arXiv:2409.17226&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 25 Sep 2024 18:00:00 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Critical spin models from holographic disorder</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17235</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Dimitris Saraidaris, Alexander Jahn&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Discrete models of holographic dualities, typically modeled by tensor networks on hyperbolic tilings, produce quantum states with a characteristic quasiperiodic disorder not present in continuum holography. In this work, we study the behavior of XXZ spin chains with such symmetries, showing that lessons learned from previous non-interacting (matchgate) tensor networks generalize to more generic Hamiltonians under holographic disorder: While the disorder breaks translation invariance, site-averaged correlations and entanglement of the disorder-free critical phase are preserved at a plateau of nonzero disorder even at large system sizes. In particular, we show numerically that the entanglement entropy curves in this disordered phase follow the expected scaling of a conformal field theory (CFT) in the continuum limit. This property is shown to be non-generic for other types of quasiperiodic disorder, only appearing when our boundary disorder ansatz is described by a "dual" bulk hyperbolic tiling. Our results therefore suggest the existence of a whole class of critical phases whose symmetries are derived from models of discrete holography.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17235'&gt;arXiv:2409.17235&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 25 Sep 2024 18:00:02 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>(SPT-)LSM theorems from projective non-invertible symmetries</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18113</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Salvatore D. Pace, Ho Tat Lam, Ömer M. Aksoy&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Projective symmetries are ubiquitous in quantum lattice models and can be leveraged to constrain their phase diagram and entanglement structure. In this paper, we investigate the consequences of projective algebras formed by non-invertible symmetries and lattice translations in a generalized $1+1$D quantum XY model based on group-valued qudits. This model is specified by a finite group $G$ and enjoys a projective $\mathsf{Rep}(G)\times Z(G)$ and translation symmetry, where symmetry operators obey a projective algebra in the presence of symmetry defects. For invertible symmetries, such projective algebras imply Lieb-Schultz-Mattis (LSM) anomalies. However, this is not generally true for non-invertible symmetries, and we derive a condition on $G$ for the existence of an LSM anomaly. When this condition is not met, we prove an SPT-LSM theorem: any unique and gapped ground state is necessarily a non-invertible weak symmetry protected topological (SPT) state with non-trivial entanglement, for which we construct an example fixed-point Hamiltonian. The projectivity also affects the dual symmetries after gauging $\mathsf{Rep}(G)\times Z(G)$ sub-symmetries, giving rise to non-Abelian and non-invertible dipole symmetries, as well as non-invertible translations. We complement our analysis with the SymTFT, where the projectivity causes it to be a topological order non-trivially enriched by translations. Throughout the paper, we develop techniques for gauging $\mathsf{Rep}(G)$ symmetry and inserting its symmetry defects on the lattice, which are applicable to other non-invertible symmetries.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18113'&gt;arXiv:2409.18113&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 26 Sep 2024 17:54:21 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Two-dopant origin of competing stripe and pair formation in Hubbard and $t$-$J$ models</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18131</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Tizian Blatz, Ulrich Schollwöck, Fabian Grusdt, Annabelle Bohrdt&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Understanding the physics of the two-dimensional Hubbard model is widely believed to be a key step in achieving a full understanding of high-$T_\mathrm{c}$ cuprate superconductors. In recent years, progress has been made by large-scale numerical simulations at finite doping and, on the other hand, by microscopic theories able to capture the physics of individual charge carriers. In this work, we study single pairs of dopants in a cylindrical system using the density-matrix renormalization group algorithm. We identify two coexisting charge configurations that couple to the spin environment in different ways: A tightly bound configuration featuring (next-)nearest-neighbor pairs and a stripe-like configuration of dopants on opposite sides of the cylinder, accompanied by a spin domain wall. Thus, we establish that the interplay between stripe order and uniform pairing, central to the models' phases at finite doping, has its origin at the single-pair level. By interpolating between the Hubbard and the related $t$-$J$ model, we are able to quantitatively understand discrepancies in the pairing properties of the two models through the three-site hopping term usually omitted from the $t$-$J$ Hamiltonian. This term is closely related to a next-nearest-neighbor tunneling $t'$, which we observe to upset the balance between the competing stripe and pair states on the two-dopant level.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18131'&gt;arXiv:2409.18131&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 26 Sep 2024 17:59:57 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Entanglement renormalization of fractonic anisotropic $\mathbb{Z}_N$ Laplacian models</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18206</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Yuan Xue, Pranay Gorantla, Zhu-Xi Luo&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Gapped fracton phases constitute a new class of quantum states of matter which connects to topological orders but does not fit easily into existing paradigms. They host unconventional features such as sub-extensive and robust ground state degeneracies as well as sensitivity to lattice geometry. We investigate the anisotropic $\mathbb{Z}_N$ Laplacian model [1] which can describe a family of fracton phases defined on arbitrary graphs. Focusing on representative geometries where the 3D lattices are extensions of 2D square, triangular, honeycomb and Kagome lattices into the third dimension, we study their ground state degeneracies and mobility of excitations, and examine their entanglement renormalization group (ERG) flows. All models show bifurcating behaviors under ERG but have distinct ERG flows sensitive to both $N$ and lattice geometry. In particular, we show that the anisotropic $\mathbb{Z}_N$ Laplacian models defined on the extensions of triangular and honeycomb lattices are equivalent when $N$ is coprime to $3$. We also point out that, in contrast to previous expectations, the model defined on the extension of Kagome lattice is robust against local perturbations if and only if $N$ is coprime to $6$.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18206'&gt;arXiv:2409.18206&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 26 Sep 2024 18:36:23 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Stripes, pair density wave, and holon Wigner crystal in single-band Hubbard model on diagonal square lattice</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18833</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Zhi Xu, Gui-Xin Liu, Yi-Fan Jiang&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We investigate the ground-state properties of the Hubbard model on wide diagonal square cylinders, rotated by $\pi/4$ relative to the regular lattice orientation. Using state-of-the-art density matrix renormalization group calculations with a large number of states, we convincingly demonstrate the development of a unidirectional charge density wave (CDW) characterized by infinite-length stripes along the primitive vector of square lattice in models with next-nearest-neighbor hopping $t'=-0.1\sim -0.3$ and doping $\delta \sim 14\%$. Intriguingly, analysis of pair-pair correlation functions along these stripes reveals incommensurate pair density wave (PDW) superconductivity with diverged susceptibility. To the best of our knowledge, this is probably the first controlled numerical evidence of dominant PDW in the single-band Hubbard model on square lattices. At lower doping $\delta \sim 10\%$, we observed the formation of an additional CDW order within each stripe, which aligns across different stripes, forming a holon Wigner crystal phase. The spin pattern retains antiferromagnetic stripes with anti-phase domain walls. The ordering momentum of this emerged CDW order is remarkably close to the center-of-mass momentum of Cooper pairs in the PDW phase, suggesting a multifaceted relationship between CDW and PDW ordering.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18833'&gt;arXiv:2409.18833&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 27 Sep 2024 15:28:27 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Correlated states in super-moiré materials with a kernel polynomial quantics tensor cross interpolation algorithm</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18898</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Adolfo O. Fumega, Marcel Niedermeier, Jose L. Lado&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Super-moiré materials represent a novel playground to engineer states of matter beyond the possibilities of conventional moiré materials. However, from the computational point of view, understanding correlated matter in these systems requires solving models with several millions of atoms, a formidable task for state-of-the-art methods. Conventional wavefunction methods for correlated matter scale with a cubic power with the number of sites, a major challenge for super-moiré materials. Here, we introduce a methodology capable of solving correlated states in super-moiré materials by combining a kernel polynomial method with a quantics tensor cross interpolation matrix product state algorithm. This strategy leverages a mapping of the super-moiré structure to a many-body Hilbert space, that is efficiently sampled with tensor cross interpolation with matrix product states, where individual evaluations are performed with a Chebyshev kernel polynomial algorithm. We demonstrate this approach with interacting super-moiré systems with up to several millions of atoms, showing its ability to capture correlated states in moiré-of-moiré systems and domain walls between different moiré systems. Our manuscript puts forward a widely applicable methodology to study correlated matter in ultra-long length scales, enabling rationalizing correlated super-moiré phenomena.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18898'&gt;arXiv:2409.18898&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 27 Sep 2024 16:36:15 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Projected Tensor-Tensor Products for Efficient Computation of Optimal Multiway Data Representations</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19402</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Katherine Keegan, Elizabeth Newman&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Tensor decompositions have become essential tools for feature extraction and compression of multiway data. Recent advances in tensor operators have enabled desirable properties of standard matrix algebra to be retained for multilinear factorizations. Behind this matrix-mimetic tensor operation is an invertible matrix whose size depends quadratically on certain dimensions of the data. As a result, for large-scale multiway data, the invertible matrix can be computationally demanding to apply and invert and can lead to inefficient tensor representations in terms of construction and storage costs. In this work, we propose a new projected tensor-tensor product that relaxes the invertibility restriction to reduce computational overhead and still preserves fundamental linear algebraic properties. The transformation behind the projected product is a tall-and-skinny matrix with unitary columns, which depends only linearly on certain dimensions of the data, thereby reducing computational complexity by an order of magnitude. We provide extensive theory to prove the matrix mimeticity and the optimality of compressed representations within the projected product framework. We further prove that projected-product-based approximations outperform a comparable, non-matrix-mimetic tensor factorization. We support the theoretical findings and demonstrate the practical benefits of projected products through numerical experiments on video and hyperspectral imaging data.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19402'&gt;arXiv:2409.19402&lt;/a&gt;] Published Sat, 28 Sep 2024 16:29:54 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Magnetic anisotropy effect on stabilizing magnetization plateaus of kagome strip chain Heisenberg antiferromagnets</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19512</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Chiara Bruzzi, Jian-Xin Zhu, Yixuan Huang&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We investigate the anisotropic effect of magnetization plateaus in the antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model on a kagome strip chain. The kagome strip chain Heisenberg model, composed of a hexagonal net of triangles forming five-site unit cells, exhibits four magnetization plateaus in the presence of an applied magnetic field. Using numerical density matrix renormalization group method, we find that the magnetization plateaus are stable against anisotropic interactions in the same direction of the applied magnetic field, but the plateaus become much smaller with anisotropic interactions in other directions. We further show the anisotropic effect of the magnon excitations of the 0.6 plateau state using linear spin wave theory. The magnon bandwidth remains small when tuning the anisotropic interactions along the field where the magnetization plateau is stable, while the band becomes more dispersive with anisotropic interactions perpendicular to the field. In addition, upon tuning down the interaction strength for the two lower legs below a critical value, the Hamiltonian of the kagome strip chain is dominated by two separate spin chains. This can be used to determine the effective lattice structure in materials with strong distortions. Our results enhance the theoretical understanding of the anisotropic effect and the nature of magnetization plateaus in kagome strip chain materials, which can contribute to the design and manipulation of kagome materials with tailored properties.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19512'&gt;arXiv:2409.19512&lt;/a&gt;] Published Sun, 29 Sep 2024 02:15:41 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

To this end, we derive the quantum spin representation of the lattice Yang-Mills theory, and compose a quantum circuit carefully tailored to hard wares, reducing the use of CZ gates. Since it is still challenging to simulate Hamiltonian evolution in present noisy quantum processors, we make the step size in the Suzuki-Trotter decomposition very large, and simulate thermalization dynamics in Floquet circuit composed of the Suzuki-Trotter evolution. We demonstrate that IBM's Heron quantum processor can simulate, by error mitigation, Floqeut thermalization dynamics in a large system consisting of $62$ qubits. Our work would be a benchmark for further quantum simulations of lattice gauge theories using real devices.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20263'&gt;arXiv:2409.20263&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 30 Sep 2024 13:02:53 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

The behavior can be continuously tuned from Bosonic to Fermionic behavior by adjusting the topological exchange angle $\theta$, which leads to a competition of different instabilities. We present the bosonization theory in presence of dynamic gauge fields, which predicts a phase diagrams of four different gapped phases with distinct dominant correlations. Advanced numerical simulations determine and analyze the exact phase transitions between Mott insulator, charge density wave, dimerized state, and Haldane insulator, all of which meet at a multi-critical line in the parameter space of anyonic angle $\theta$, onsite interaction $U$, and nearest neighbor repulsion $V$. Superfluid and pair-superfluid phases are stable in a region of small $V$.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00089'&gt;arXiv:2410.00089&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 30 Sep 2024 18:00:00 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Kinetic magnetism and stripe order in the antiferromagnetic bosonic ${t-J}$ model</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00904</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Timothy J. Harris, Ulrich Schollwöck, Annabelle Bohrdt, Fabian Grusdt&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Unraveling the microscopic mechanisms governing the physics of doped quantum magnets is key to advancing our understanding of strongly correlated quantum matter. Quantum simulation platforms, e.g., ultracold atoms in optical lattices or tweezer arrays, provide a powerful tool to investigate the interplay between spin and charge motion in microscopic detail. Here, in a new twist, we disentangle the role of particle statistics from the physics of strong correlations by exploring the strong coupling limit of doped \emph{bosonic} quantum magnets, specifically the antiferromagnetic (AFM) bosonic $t-J$ model. Using large-scale density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) calculations, we map out the phase diagram on the 2D square lattice at finite doping. In the low-doping regime, bosonic holes form partially-filled stripes, akin to those observed in high-$T_c$ cuprates. As doping increases, a transition occurs to a partially-polarized ferromagnetic (FM) phase, driven by the motion of mobile bosonic charge carriers forming Nagaoka polarons. At high doping or large $t/J$, the system evolves into a fully-polarized ferromagnet. These findings shed new light on the role of particle statistics in strongly correlated many-body systems, revealing connections to stripe formation and the physics of kinetic (i.e., Nagaoka-type) ferromagnetism. Our results may be realized in state-of-the-art quantum simulation platforms with bosonic quantum gas microscopes and Rydberg atom tweezer arrays, paving the way for future experimental studies of doped bosonic quantum magnets.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00904'&gt;arXiv:2410.00904&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 01 Oct 2024 17:50:10 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

By mapping the operator evolution to a classical Markov process,we perform Monte Carlo simulations to access the time evolution of local operator density and entanglement with polynomial computational cost. Our results reveal that the operator density converges exponentially to a steady-state value, with analytical bounds that match our simulations. Additionally, we observe a volume-law scaling of operator entanglement across different subregions,and identify a critical transition from maximal to sub-maximal entanglement growth, governed by the circuit's gate parameter. This transition, confirmed by both mean-field theory and Monte Carlo simulations, provides new insights into operator entanglement dynamics in quantum many-body systems. Our work offers a scalable computational framework for studying long-time operator evolution and entanglement, paving the way for deeper exploration of quantum information dynamics.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00953'&gt;arXiv:2410.00953&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 01 Oct 2024 18:00:00 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Itinerant magnetism in Hubbard models with long-range interactions</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Johannes Dieplinger, Rhine Samajdar, R. N. Bhatt&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; A wide variety of experimental platforms, ranging from semiconductor quantum-dot arrays to moiré materials, have recently emerged as powerful quantum simulators for studying the Hubbard model and its variants. Motivated by these developments, here, we investigate a generalization of the Hubbard model which includes the effects of long-range Coulomb interactions. Working on finite-sized two-dimensional square and triangular lattices, we use exact diagonalization and density-matrix renormalization group calculations to probe the magnetic structure of the ground state in the strong-coupling regime, where $U$ (the onsite repulsion) $\gg$ $t$ (the nearest-neighbor hopping). For small electron dopings above the half-filled antiferromagnet, we numerically uncover a rich variety of magnetically ordered states, and in conjunction with theoretical arguments, infer the phase diagram of the system as a function of doping and interaction strengths. In particular, we find that the inclusion of long-range Coulomb interactions induces an instability of high-spin states$\unicode{x2014}$such as the saturated Nagaoka ferromagnet$\unicode{x2014}$towards phase separation and stripe ordering. We also present proposals for the observation of some of our key findings in experiments that would shed further light on this paradigmatic strongly correlated system.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00955'&gt;arXiv:2410.00955&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 01 Oct 2024 18:00:00 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>First-order transition and marginal critical behavior in a novel 2D frustrated Ising model</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Christophe Chatelain&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The phase diagram of a novel two-dimensional frustrated Ising model with both anti-ferromagnetic and ferromagnetic couplings is studied using Tensor-Network Renormalization-Group techniques. This model can be seen as two anti-ferromagnetic Ising replicas coupled by non-local spin-spin interactions, designed in such a way that the continuum limit matches that of the still debated J1 -J2 model and induces a marginal critical behavior. Our model has the advantage of having more symmetries than the J1 -J2 model and of allowing a more straightforward implementation of Tensor-Network Renormalization-Group algorithms We demonstrate the existence of two transition lines, featuring both first and second-order regimes. In the latter, the central charge and the critical exponents are shown to be compatible with the Ashkin-Teller universality class. This picture is consistent with that given by Monte Carlo simulations of the J1 -J2 model but not with recent studies with Tensor-Network techniques.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01460'&gt;arXiv:2410.01460&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 02 Oct 2024 12:12:50 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

Süllow&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We report an extensive high-field study of atacamite Cu$_2$Cl(OH)$_3$, a material realization of quantum sawtooth chains with weak interchain couplings, in continuous and pulsed magnetic fields up to 58 T. In particular, we have mapped the entropy landscape for fields as high as 35 T and have identified a field-induced quantum critical point at 21.9(1) T for $\mathbf{H} \parallel c$ axis. The quantum critical point separates field regions with and without magnetic order, evidenced by our thermodynamic study and $^1$H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, but lies far below full saturation of the magnetization. Corroborated by numerical results using density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) calculations, we find this behavior associated with a dimensional reduction of the spin system: the sawtooth chain effectively decouples into an antiferromagnetic spin-$1/2$ chain (backbone of the sawtooth chain) in the presence of an exchange field produced by the remaining field-polarized spins.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01947'&gt;arXiv:2410.01947&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 02 Oct 2024 18:48:33 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Searching for Efficient Linear Layers over a Continuous Space of Structured Matrices</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02117</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Andres Potapczynski, Shikai Qiu, Marc Finzi, Christopher Ferri, Zixi Chen, Micah Goldblum, Bayan Bruss, Christopher De Sa, Andrew Gordon Wilson&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Dense linear layers are the dominant computational bottleneck in large neural networks, presenting a critical need for more efficient alternatives. Previous efforts focused on a small number of hand-crafted structured matrices and neglected to investigate whether these structures can surpass dense layers in terms of compute-optimal scaling laws when both the model size and training examples are optimally allocated. In this work, we present a unifying framework that enables searching among all linear operators expressible via an Einstein summation. This framework encompasses many previously proposed structures, such as low-rank, Kronecker, Tensor-Train, Block Tensor-Train (BTT), and Monarch, along with many novel structures. To analyze the framework, we develop a taxonomy of all such operators based on their computational and algebraic properties and show that differences in the compute-optimal scaling laws are mostly governed by a small number of variables that we introduce. Namely, a small $\omega$ (which measures parameter sharing) and large $\psi$ (which measures the rank) reliably led to better scaling laws. Guided by the insight that full-rank structures that maximize parameters per unit of compute perform the best, we propose BTT-MoE, a novel Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture obtained by sparsifying computation in the BTT structure. In contrast to the standard sparse MoE for each entire feed-forward network, BTT-MoE learns an MoE in every single linear layer of the model, including the projection matrices in the attention blocks. We find BTT-MoE provides a substantial compute-efficiency gain over dense layers and standard MoE.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02117'&gt;arXiv:2410.02117&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 03 Oct 2024 00:44:50 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Sample-Efficient Quantum State Tomography for Structured Quantum States in One Dimension</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02583</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Zhen Qin, Casey Jameson, Alireza Goldar, Michael B. Wakin, Zhexuan Gong, Zhihui Zhu&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; While quantum state tomography (QST) remains the gold standard for benchmarking and verifying quantum devices, it requires an exponentially large number of measurements and classical computational resources for generic quantum many-body systems, making it impractical even for intermediate-size quantum devices. Fortunately, many physical quantum states often exhibit certain low-dimensional structures that enable the development of efficient QST. A notable example is the class of states represented by matrix product operators (MPOs) with a finite matrix/bond dimension, which include most physical states in one dimension and where the number of independent parameters describing the states only grows linearly with the number of qubits. Whether a sample efficient quantum state tomography protocol, where the number of required state copies scales only linearly as the number of parameters describing the state, exists for a generic MPO state still remains an important open question. In this paper, we answer this fundamental question affirmatively by using a class of informationally complete positive operator-valued measures (IC-POVMs) -- including symmetric IC-POVMs (SIC-POVMs) and spherical $t$-designs -- focusing on sample complexity while not accounting for the implementation complexity of the measurement settings. For SIC-POVMs and (approximate) spherical 2-designs, we show that the number of state copies to guarantee bounded recovery error of an MPO state with a constrained least-squares estimator depends on the probability distribution of the MPO under the POVM but scales only linearly with $n$ when the distribution is approximately uniform. For spherical $t$-designs with $t\geq 3$, we prove that only a number of state copies proportional to the number of independent parameters in the MPO is sufficient for a guaranteed recovery of any state represented by an MPO.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02583'&gt;arXiv:2410.02583&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 03 Oct 2024 15:26:26 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Quantum Restored Symmetry Protected Topological Phases</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Dhruv Tiwari, Steffen Bollmann, Sebastian Paeckel, Elio J. König&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Symmetry protected topological (SPT) phases are fundamental quantum many-body states of matter beyond Landau's paradigm. Here, we introduce the concept of quantum restored SPTs (QRSPTs), where the protecting symmetry is spontaneously broken at each instance in time, but restored after time average over quantum fluctuations, so that topological features re-emerge. To illustrate the concept, we study a one-dimensional fermionic Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model with fluctuating superconducting order. We solve this problem in several limiting cases using a variety of analytical methods and compare them to numerical (density matrix renormalization group) simulations which are valid throughout the parameter regime. We thereby map out the phase diagram and identify a QRSPT phase with topological features which are reminiscent from (but not identical to) the topology of the underlying free fermion system. The QRSPT paradigm thereby stimulates a new perspective for the constructive design of novel topological quantum many-body phases.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02689'&gt;arXiv:2410.02689&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 03 Oct 2024 17:16:38 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Pseudoentanglement from tensor networks</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02758</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Zihan Cheng, Xiaozhou Feng, Matteo Ippoliti&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Pseudoentangled states are defined by their ability to hide their entanglement structure: they are indistinguishable from random states to any observer with polynomial resources, yet can have much less entanglement than random states. Existing constructions of pseudoentanglement based on phase- and/or subset-states are limited in the entanglement structures they can hide: e.g., the states may have low entanglement on a single cut, on all cuts at once, or on local cuts in one dimension. Here we introduce new constructions of pseudoentangled states based on (pseudo)random tensor networks that affords much more flexibility in the achievable entanglement structures. We illustrate our construction with the simplest example of a matrix product state, realizable as a staircase circuit of pseudorandom unitary gates, which exhibits pseudo-area-law scaling of entanglement in one dimension. We then generalize our construction to arbitrary tensor network structures that admit an isometric realization. A notable application of this result is the construction of pseudoentangled `holographic' states whose entanglement entropy obeys a Ryu-Takayanagi `minimum-cut' formula, answering a question posed in [Aaronson et al., arXiv:2211.00747].&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02758'&gt;arXiv:2410.02758&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 03 Oct 2024 17:59:09 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Efficient tomography of microwave photonic cluster states</title>

Such many-body states have been efficiently generated by entangling a chain of itinerant photonic qubits in the optical or microwave domain. However, it has remained challenging to fully characterize the generated many-body states by experimentally reconstructing their exponentially large density matrices. Here, we develop an efficient tomography method based on the matrix-product-operator formalism and demonstrate it on a cluster state of up to 35 microwave photonic qubits by reconstructing its $2^{35} \times 2^{35}$ density matrix. The full characterization enables us to detect the performance degradation of our photon source which occurs only when generating a large cluster state. This tomography method is generally applicable to various physical realizations of entangled qubits and provides an efficient benchmarking method for guiding the development of high-fidelity sources of entangled photons.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03345'&gt;arXiv:2410.03345&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 04 Oct 2024 12:05:30 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Confinement and false vacuum decay on the Potts quantum spin chain</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Octavio Pomponio, Anna Krasznai, Gábor Takács&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We consider non-equilibrium dynamics after quantum quenches in the mixed-field three-state Potts quantum chain in the ferromagnetic regime. Compared to the analogous setting for the Ising spin chain, the Potts model has a much richer phenomenology, which originates partly from baryonic excitations in the spectrum and partly from the various possible relative alignments of the initial magnetisation and the longitudinal field. We obtain the excitation spectrum by combining semi-classical approximation and exact diagonalisation, and we use the results to explain the various dynamical behaviours we observe. Besides recovering dynamical confinement, as well as Wannier-Stark localisation due to Bloch oscillations similar to the Ising chain, a novel feature is the presence of baryonic excitations in the quench spectroscopy. In addition, when the initial magnetisation and the longitudinal field are misaligned, both confinement and Bloch oscillations only result in partial localisation, with some correlations retaining an unsuppressed light-cone behaviour together with a corresponding growth of entanglement entropy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03382'&gt;arXiv:2410.03382&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 04 Oct 2024 12:49:49 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Entanglement in dual unitary quantum circuits with impurities</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03442</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Shachar Fraenkel, Colin Rylands&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Bipartite entanglement entropy is one of the most useful characterizations of universal properties in a many-body quantum system. Far from equilibrium, there exist two highly effective theories describing its dynamics -- the quasiparticle and membrane pictures. In this work we investigate entanglement dynamics, and these two complementary approaches, in a quantum circuit model perturbed by an impurity. In particular, we consider a dual unitary quantum circuit containing a spatially fixed, non-dual-unitary impurity gate, allowing for differing local Hilbert space dimensions to either side. We compute the entanglement entropy for both a semi-infinite and a finite subsystem within a finite distance of the impurity, comparing exact results to predictions of the effective theories. We find that for a semi-infinite subsystem, both theories agree with each other and the exact calculation. For a finite subsystem, however, both theories qualitatively differ, with the quasiparticle picture predicting a non-monotonic growth in contrast to the membrane picture. We show that such non-monotonic behavior can arise even in random chaotic circuits, shedding light on the range of validity of the membrane picture in such systems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03442'&gt;arXiv:2410.03442&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 04 Oct 2024 13:57:01 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Compressing multivariate functions with tree tensor networks</title>

One-dimensional tensor networks -- often referred to as tensor trains (TT) or matrix product states (MPS) -- are increasingly being used as a numerical ansatz for continuum functions by "quantizing" the inputs into discrete binary digits. Here we demonstrate the power of more general tree tensor networks for this purpose. We provide direct constructions of a number of elementary functions as generic tree tensor networks and interpolative constructions for more complicated functions via a generalization of the tensor cross interpolation algorithm. For a range of multi-dimensional functions we show how more structured tree tensor networks offer a significantly more efficient ansatz than the commonly used tensor train. We demonstrate an application of our methods to solving multi-dimensional, non-linear Fredholm equations, providing a rigorous bound on the rank of the solution which, in turn, guarantees exponentially scaling accuracy with the size of the tree tensor network for certain problems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03572'&gt;arXiv:2410.03572&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 04 Oct 2024 16:20:52 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

We first investigate the time dynamics of the system by calculating the emitter population and illustrate the breakdown of the weak excitation approximation, for both 1-photon and 2-photon excitation. We show how a 1-photon pulse yields a transmitted long-time spectrum that is identical to the input pulse, despite significant population effects. However, the dynamical spectra and spectral intensity show rich population effects. We also show the differences between 1-photon and 2-photon excitation, where the latter shows clear signatures of nonlinear saturation effects. Analytical and numerically exact matrix product state solutions are shown.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03715'&gt;arXiv:2410.03715&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 27 Sep 2024 20:51:37 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

For a rectangular pulse shape, we present an exact temporal scattering theory for the waveguide-QED system to derive analytical expressions for the TLS population, for 1-photon and 2-photon pulses, for both chiral and symmetric emitters. We also derive the stationary (long time) and time-dependent spectra for 1 photon excitation, and show how these differ at a fundamental level when connecting to TLS population effects. Numerically, we also present matrix product state (MPS) simulations, which allow us to compute more general photon correlation functions for arbitrary quantum pulses, and we use this approach to also show results for Gaussian quantum pulses, and to confirm the accuracy of our analytical results. In addition, we show how significant population TLS effects also occur for pulses relatively long compared to the radiative decay time (showing that a weak excitation approximation cannot be made), and investigate the population signatures, nonlinear features and dynamical behavior as a function of pulse length. These detailed theoretical results extend and complement our related Letter results [Arranz Regidor et al., unpublished, 2024].&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03716'&gt;arXiv:2410.03716&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 27 Sep 2024 20:59:00 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>HaTT: Hadamard avoiding TT recompression</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04385</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Zhonghao Sun, Jizu Huang, Chuanfu Xiao, Chao Yang&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The Hadamard product of tensor train (TT) tensors is a fundamental nonlinear operation in scientific computing and data analysis. However, due to its tendency to significantly increase TT ranks, the Hadamard product poses a major computational challenge in TT tensor-based algorithms. To address this, it is crucial to develop recompression algorithms that mitigate the effects of this rank increase. Existing recompression algorithms require an explicit representation of the Hadamard product, resulting in high computational and storage costs. In this work, we propose a Hadamard avoiding TT recompression (HaTT) algorithm, which reduces both computational complexity and storage requirements. By leveraging the structure of the Hadamard product in TT tensors and exploiting its Hadamard product-free property, the HaTT algorithm achieves significantly lower complexity compared to existing TT recompression methods. This is confirmed through both complexity analysis and numerical experiments. Furthermore, the HaTT algorithm is applied to solve the Allen--Cahn equation, achieving substantial speedup over existing TT recompression algorithms without sacrificing accuracy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04385'&gt;arXiv:2410.04385&lt;/a&gt;] Published Sun, 06 Oct 2024 07:54:14 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

We propose a probabilistic interpretation and utilize density estimation losses like Sliced Wasserstein to train TT decompositions, resulting in robust point cloud compression. We reveal an inherent hierarchical structure within TT point clouds, facilitating efficient approximate nearest-neighbor searches. In our paper, we provide detailed insights into the methodology and conduct comprehensive comparisons with existing methods.

      <title>Nonadiabatic Quantum Dynamics of Molecules Scattering from Metal Surfaces</title>

Maurer, Michael Thoss&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Nonadiabatic coupling between electrons and molecular motion at metal surfaces leads to energy dissipation and dynamical steering effects during chemical surface dynamics. We present a theoretical approach to the scattering of molecules from metal surfaces that incorporates all nonadiabatic and quantum nuclear effects due to the coupling of the molecular degrees of freedom to the electrons in the metal. This is achieved with the hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM) approach combined with a matrix product state representation in twin space. The method is applied to the scattering of nitric oxide from Au(111), for which strongly nonadiabatic energy loss during scattering has been experimentally observed, thus presenting a significant theoretical challenge. Since the HEOM approach treats the molecule-surface coupling exactly, it captures the interplay between nonadiabatic and quantum nuclear effects. Finally, the data obtained by the HEOM approach is used as a rigorous benchmark to assess various mixed quantum-classical methods, from which we derive insights into the mechanisms of energy dissipation and the suitable working regimes of each method.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05142'&gt;arXiv:2410.05142&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 07 Oct 2024 15:54:36 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Entanglement, information and non-equilibrium phase transitions in long-range open quantum Ising chains</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05370</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Daniel A. Paz, Benjamin E. Maves, Naushad A. Kamar, Arghavan Safavi-Naini, Mohammad Maghrebi&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Non-equilibrium phase transitions of open quantum systems generically exhibit diverging classical but not quantum correlations. Still entanglement -- characterizing the latter correlations -- can be sensitive to the phase transition. Furthermore, mutual information, bounding the total correlations, should exhibit critical scaling at the transition. In this work, we study these quantities in the steady state of open quantum Ising chains with power-law interactions (with the exponent $0\le \alpha \le 3$) where spins are subject to spontaneous emission. The bulk of this paper is dedicated to a detailed analytical as well as numerical analysis of the infinite-range model ($\alpha=0$), a model that is closely related to the paradigmatic open Dicke model. Our main findings are that the entanglement, while being finite, peaks, exhibits a kink and takes a universal value at the transition, while the mutual information exhibits critical scaling not only at the transition but well into the ordered phase, underscoring a hidden criticality that is not captured by (two-point) correlations. We consider three distinct entanglement measures: logarithmic negativity; quantum Fisher information; and, spin squeezing. Specifically, we show that the collective spin operator that maximizes the quantum Fisher information can be identified with the \textit{gapless} mode of the phase transition, while the squeezed direction is that of the \textit{gapped} mode. Finally, we investigate power-law interacting models using matrix product states where we find comparable bounds on squeezing even when no phase transition is expected (for larger $\alpha$), thus the connection to the phase transition does not appear to hold for shorter-range interactions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05370'&gt;arXiv:2410.05370&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 07 Oct 2024 18:00:00 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Positive bias makes tensor-network contraction tractable</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05414</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Jiaqing Jiang, Jielun Chen, Norbert Schuch, Dominik Hangleiter&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Tensor network contraction is a powerful computational tool in quantum many-body physics, quantum information and quantum chemistry. The complexity of contracting a tensor network is thought to mainly depend on its entanglement properties, as reflected by the Schmidt rank across bipartite cuts. Here, we study how the complexity of tensor-network contraction depends on a different notion of quantumness, namely, the sign structure of its entries. We tackle this question rigorously by investigating the complexity of contracting tensor networks whose entries have a positive bias. We show that for intermediate bond dimension d&gt;ñ, a small positive mean value &gt;~1/d of the tensor entries already dramatically decreases the computational complexity of approximately contracting random tensor networks, enabling a quasi-polynomial time algorithm for arbitrary 1/poly(n) multiplicative approximation. At the same time exactly contracting such tensor networks remains #P-hard, like for the zero-mean case [HHEG20]. The mean value 1/d matches the phase transition point observed in [CJHS24]. Our proof makes use of Barvinok's method for approximate counting and the technique of mapping random instances to statistical mechanical models. We further consider the worst-case complexity of approximate contraction of positive tensor networks, where all entries are non-negative. We first give a simple proof showing that a multiplicative approximation with error exponentially close to one is at least StoqMA-hard. We then show that when considering additive error in the matrix 1-norm, the contraction of positive tensor network is BPP-Complete. This result compares to Arad and Landau's [AL10] result, which shows that for general tensor networks, approximate contraction up to matrix 2-norm additive error is BQP-Complete.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05414'&gt;arXiv:2410.05414&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 07 Oct 2024 18:27:23 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Statistics of topological defects across a phase transition in a digital superconducting quantum processor</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Oriel Kiss, Daniil Teplitskiy, Michele Grossi, Antonio Mandarino&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; When a quantum phase transition is crossed within a finite time, critical slowing down disrupts adiabatic dynamics, resulting in the formation of topological defects. The average density of these defects scales with the quench rate, adhering to a universal power law as predicted by the Kibble-Zurek mechanism (KZM). In this study, we aim to investigate the counting statistics of kink density in the 1D transverse-field quantum Ising model. We demonstrate on multiple quantum processing units up to 100 qubits, that higher-order cumulants follow a universal power law scaling as a function of the quench time. We also show the breakdown of the KZM for short quenches for finite-size systems. Tensor network simulations corroborate our quantum simulation results for bigger systems not in the asymptotic limit.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06250'&gt;arXiv:2410.06250&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 08 Oct 2024 18:00:01 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Low-rank decomposition on the antisymmetric product of geminals for strongly correlated electrons</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06666</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Airi Kawasaki, Naoki Nakatani&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We investigated some variational methods to compute a wavefunction based on antisymmetric product of geminals (APG). The Waring decomposition on the APG wavefunction leads a finite sum of antisymmetrized geminal power (AGP) wavefunctions, each for which the variational principle can be applied. We call this as AGP-CI method which provides a variational solution of the APG wavefunction efficiently. However, number of AGP wavefunctions in the exact AGP-CI formalism become exponentially large in case of many-electron systems. Therefore, we also investigate the low-rank APG wavefunction, in which the geminal matrices are factorized by the Schur decomposition. Interestingly, only a few non-zero eigenvalues (up to half number of electrons) were found from the Schur decomposition on the APG wavefunction. We developed some methods to approximate the APG wavefunction by lowering the ranks of geminal matrices, and demonstrate their performance. Our new geminal method based on the low-rank decomposition can drastically reduce the number of variational parameters, although there is no efficient algorithm so far, due to some mathematical complications.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06666'&gt;arXiv:2410.06666&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 09 Oct 2024 08:22:54 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Kramers-Wannier self-duality and non-invertible translation symmetry in quantum chains: a wave-function perspective</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06727</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Hua-Chen Zhang, Germán Sierra&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The Kramers-Wannier self-duality of critical quantum chains is examined from the perspective of model wave functions. We demonstrate, using the transverse-field Ising chain and the $3$-state Potts chain as examples, that the symmetry operator for the Kramers-Wannier self-duality follows in a simple and direct way from a `generalised' translation symmetry of the model wave function in the anyonic fusion basis. This translation operation, in turn, comprises a sequence of $F$-moves in the underlying fusion category. The symmetry operator thus obtained naturally admits the form of a matrix product operator and obeys non-invertible fusion rules. The findings reveal an intriguing connection between the (non-invertible) translation symmetry on the lattice and topological aspects of the conformal field theory describing the scaling limit.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06727'&gt;arXiv:2410.06727&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 09 Oct 2024 09:50:57 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Quantum dynamics in a spin-1/2 square lattice $J_{1}$-$J_{2}$-$δ$ altermagnet</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06955</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Yang Liu, Shiqi Shao, Saisai He, Z. Y. Xie, Jia-Wei Mei, Hong-Gang Luo, Jize Zhao&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; A key feature of the newly discovered altermagnet is that its spin degeneracy is lifted, although it has an antiferromagnetic order and zero net magnetization. In this work, we investigate a frustrated spin-1/2 $J_1$-$J_2$-$\delta$ Heisenberg model on the square lattice by the tensor network methodin combination with the linear spin-wave theory, with our focus on both the magnon excitations and longitudinal excitations.For a small $J_2$ and a finite range of $\delta$ we demonstrate that such a model hosts an altermagnetic ground state. Its magnon spectrum is split into two branches and the largest splitting occurs at $\left(\pm\pi/2, \pm\pi/2\right)$ in the Brillouin zone. The magnitudes of splitting in the two magnon modes are equal with respect to the case of $\delta=0$. Dynamical spin structure factors show that the low-energy peak in the longitudinal spectral weight around $(\pi/2, \pi/2)$ is also split, and thus the relative positions of the magnon modes and longitudinal modes in energy may change in the presence of a finite $\delta$. These findings demonstrate that the altermagnets harbor more complex quantum dynamics than the conventional collinear antiferromagnets.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06955'&gt;arXiv:2410.06955&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 09 Oct 2024 14:52:02 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Measurement-induced transitions for interacting fermions</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07334</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Igor Poboiko, Paul Pöpperl, Igor V. Gornyi, Alexander D. Mirlin&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Effect of measurements on interacting fermionic systems with particle-number conservation, whose dynamics is governed by a time-independent Hamiltonian, is studied. We develop Keldysh field-theoretical framework that provides a unified approach to observables characterizing entanglement and charge fluctuations. Within this framework, we derive a replicated Keldysh non-linear sigma model (NLSM), which incorporates boundary conditions specifically designed to produce generating functions for charge cumulants and entanglement entropies directly in the NLSM language. By using the renormalization-group approach for the NLSM, we determine the phase diagram and the scaling of physical observables. Crucially, the interaction-induced terms in the NLSM action reduce its symmetry, which affects the physics of the problem in a dramatic way. First, this leads to the "information-charge separation": charge cumulants get decoupled from entanglement entropies. Second, the interaction stabilizes the volume-law phase for the entanglement. Third, for spatial dimensionality $d=1$, the interaction stabilizes the phase with logarithmic growth of charge cumulants (in the thermodynamic limit). Thus, in the presence of interaction, there are measurement transitions in any $d$, at variance with free fermions, for which a $d=1$ system is always in the area-law phase. Analytical results are supported by numerical simulations using time-dependent variational principles for matrix product states, which, in particular, confirm the separation of information and charge as a hallmark of the delocalized phase.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07334'&gt;arXiv:2410.07334&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 09 Oct 2024 18:00:08 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Resonant inelastic x-ray scattering spectra of spinon, doublon, and quarton excitations of a spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ antiferromagnetic Heisenberg trimer chain</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07347</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Junli Li, Jun-Qing Cheng, Trinanjan Datta, Dao-Xin Yao&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We investigate the excitation spectra of a spin-1/2 antiferromagnetic Heisenberg trimer spin chain by employing a combination of numerical and theoretical techniques. Utilizing the Krylov-space correction-vector method in density matrix renormalization group (DMRG), we calculate both the direct and indirect resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) spectra for the trimer spin chain. To interpret the observed features in the RIXS spectra, we perform a theoretical perturbative analysis to compute the energy dispersions which are then utilized to determine the density of states (DOS) for both the single-particle and the two-particle excitation spectra. Our results show that the single-particle continua of the direct RIXS spectrum align with the energy levels observed in the DOS spectra of spinon, doublon, and quarton excitations. Furthermore, the two-particle continua are revealed in the indirect RIXS process, where all possible single particle excitations combine to form the various two-particle excitations of the trimer spin chain. Based on our calculations, we propose the RIXS mechanism of generating the fractionalized (spinon) and collective (doublon and quarton) excitations in the trimer spin chain at both the $L$-edge and the $K$-edge, including discussing the interplay of these excitations in the RIXS spectrum for various trimer coupling strength. The computed energy range of the excitations suggest the possibility of experimental detection at both the $L$-edge and the $K$-edge within the current capabilities of RIXS instrumentation resolution.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07347'&gt;arXiv:2410.07347&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 09 Oct 2024 18:01:24 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Phases and Phase Transitions of the Disordered Quantum Clock Model</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07640</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Vishnu Pulloor Kuttanikkad, Gaurav Khairnar, Rajesh Narayanan, Thomas Vojta&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We study the phases and phase transitions of a disordered one-dimensional quantum $q$-state clock Hamiltonian using large-scale Monte Carlo simulations. Making contact with earlier results, we confirm that the clean, translational invariant version of the model, for $q=6$, hosts an intermediate emergent quasi-long-range ordered (QLRO) phase between the symmetry-broken true long-range ordered (TLRO) phase and the disordered (paramagnetic) phase. With increasing disorder strength, the quasi-long-range ordered phase shrinks and finally vanishes at a multi-critical point, beyond which there is a direct transition from the TLRO phase to the paramagnetic phase. After establishing the phase diagram, we characterize the critical behaviors of the various quantum phase transitions in the model. We find that weak disorder is an irrelevant perturbation of the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transitions that separate the QLRO phase from the TLRO and paramagnetic phases. For stronger disorder, some of the critical exponents become disorder-dependent already before the system reaches the multicritical point. We also show that beyond the multicritical point, the direct transition from the TLRO phase to the paramagnetic phase is governed by an infinite-randomness critical point in line with strong-disorder renormalization group predictions. While our numerical results are for $q=6$, we expect the qualitative features of the behavior to hold for all $q&gt;4$.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07640'&gt;arXiv:2410.07640&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 10 Oct 2024 06:18:16 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Holographic View of Mixed-State Symmetry-Protected Topological Phases in Open Quantum Systems</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08205</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Shijun Sun, Jian-Hao Zhang, Zhen Bi, Yizhi You&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We establish a holographic duality between d-dimensional mixed-state symmetry-protected topological phases (mSPTs) and (d+1)-dimensional subsystem symmetry-protected topological states (SSPTs). Specifically, we show that the reduced density matrix of the boundary layer of a (d+1)-dimensional SSPT with subsystem symmetry S and global symmetry G corresponds to a d-dimensional mSPT with strong S and weak G symmetries. Conversely, we demonstrate that the wavefunction of an SSPT can be constructed by replicating the density matrix of the corresponding lower-dimensional mSPT. This mapping links the density matrix in lower dimensions to the entanglement properties of higher-dimensional wavefunctions, providing an approach for analyzing nonlinear quantities and quantum information metrics in mixed-state systems. Our duality offers a new perspective for studying intrinsic mSPTs that are unique to open quantum systems, without pure state analogs. We show that strange correlators and twisted Rényi-N correlators can diagnose these nontrivial phases and explore their connection to strange correlators in pure-state SSPTs. Furthermore, we discuss several implications of this holographic duality, including a method for preparing intrinsic mSPT states through the duality.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08205'&gt;arXiv:2410.08205&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 10 Oct 2024 17:59:42 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Multi wavefunction overlap and multi entropy for topological ground states in (2+1) dimensions</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Bowei Liu, Junjia Zhang, Shuhei Ohyama, Yuya Kusuki, Shinsei Ryu&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Multi-wavefunction overlaps -- generalizations of the quantum mechanical inner product for more than two quantum many-body states -- are valuable tools for studying many-body physics. In this paper, we investigate the multi-wavefunction overlap of (2+1)-dimensional gapped ground states, focusing particularly on symmetry-protected topological (SPT) states. We demonstrate how these overlaps can be calculated using the bulk-boundary correspondence and (1+1)-dimensional edge theories, specifically conformal field theory. When applied to SPT phases, we show that the topological invariants, which can be thought of as discrete higher Berry phases, can be extracted from the multi-wavefunction overlap of four ground states with appropriate symmetry actions. Additionally, we find that the multi-wavefunction overlap can be expressed in terms of the realignment of reduced density matrices. Furthermore, we illustrate that the same technique can be used to evaluate the multi-entropy -- a quantum information theoretical quantity associated with multi-partition of many-body quantum states -- for (2+1)-dimensional gapped ground states. Combined with numerics, we show that the difference between multi-entropy for tripartition and second Rényi entropies is bounded from below by $(c_{{\it tot}}/4)\ln 2$ where $c_{{\it tot}}$ is the central charge of ungappable degrees of freedom. To calculate multi-entropy numerically for free fermion systems (such as Chern insulators), we develop the correlator method for multi-entropy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08284'&gt;arXiv:2410.08284&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 10 Oct 2024 18:12:03 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

It requires either to perform density matrix simulations (coming with a space overhead) or to sample over "quantum trajectories" where Kraus operators are inserted randomly (coming with a runtime overhead). We propose a simulation technique based on a representation of hardware noise in terms of trajectories generated by operators that remain close to identity at low noise. This representation significantly reduces the variance over the quantum trajectories, speeding up noisy simulations by factors around $10$ to $100$. As a by-product, we provide a formula to factorize multiple-Pauli channels into a concatenation of single Pauli channels.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08639'&gt;arXiv:2410.08639&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 11 Oct 2024 09:04:02 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Quantum cellular automata and categorical dualities of spin chains</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08884</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Corey Jones, Kylan Schatz, Dominic J. Williamson&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Dualities play a central role in the study of quantum spin chains, providing insight into the structure of quantum phase diagrams and phase transitions. In this work we study categorical dualities, which are defined as bounded-spread isomorphisms between algebras of symmetry-respecting local operators on a spin chain. We consider generalized global symmetries that correspond to unitary fusion categories, which are represented by matrix-product operator algebras. A fundamental question about dualities is whether they can be extended to quantum cellular automata on the larger algebra generated by all local operators that respect the unit matrix-product operator. For conventional global symmetries, which are on-site representations of finite groups, this larger algebra is simply the tensor product of algebras associated to individual spins in the chain. We present a solution to the extension problem using the machinery of Doplicher-Haag-Roberts bimodules. Our solution provides a crisp categorical criterion for when an extension of a duality exists. We show that the set of possible extensions form a torsor over the invertible objects in the relevant symmetry category. As a corollary, we obtain a classification result concerning dualities in the group case.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08884'&gt;arXiv:2410.08884&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 11 Oct 2024 15:00:50 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Disentangling unitary dynamics with classically simulable quantum circuits</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09001</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Gerald E. Fux, Benjamin Béri, Rosario Fazio, Emanuele Tirrito&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We show that states obtained from deep random Clifford circuits doped with non-Clifford phase gates (including T-gates and $\sqrt{\mathrm{T}}$-gates) can be disentangled completely, provided the number of non-Clifford gates is smaller or approximately equal to the number of qubits. This implies that Pauli expectation values of such states can be efficiently simulated classically, despite them exhibiting both extensive entanglement and extensive nonstabilizerness. We prove this result analytically using a quantum error correction formulation, demonstrate its applicability numerically, and discuss consequences for the disentanglability of states generated through Hamiltonian dynamics. We show that this result implies a novel representation of approximate state designs that can also facilitate their efficient generation, and we propose a novel quantum circuit compression scheme for Clifford circuits doped with non-Clifford phase gates.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09001'&gt;arXiv:2410.09001&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 11 Oct 2024 17:18:26 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Learning dynamic quantum circuits for efficient state preparation</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09030</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Faisal Alam, Bryan K. Clark&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Dynamic quantum circuits (DQCs) incorporate mid-circuit measurements and gates conditioned on these measurement outcomes. DQCs can prepare certain long-range entangled states in constant depth, making them a promising route to preparing complex quantum states on devices with a limited coherence time. Almost all constructions of DQCs for state preparation have been formulated analytically, relying on special structure in the target states. In this work, we approach the problem of state preparation variationally, developing scalable tensor network algorithms which find high-fidelity DQC preparations for generic states. We apply our algorithms to critical states, random matrix product states, and subset states. We consider both DQCs with a fixed number of ancillae and those with an extensive number of ancillae. Even in the few ancillae regime, the DQCs discovered by our algorithms consistently prepare states with lower infidelity than a static quantum circuit of the same depth. Notably, we observe constant fidelity gains across system sizes and circuit depths. For DQCs with an extensive number of ancillae, we introduce scalable methods for decoding measurement outcomes, including a neural network decoder and a real-time decoding protocol. Our work demonstrates the power of an algorithmic approach to generating DQC circuits, broadening their scope of applications to new areas of quantum computing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09030'&gt;arXiv:2410.09030&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 11 Oct 2024 17:47:46 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Systematic construction of stabilizer codes via gauging abelian boundary symmetries</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09044</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Bram Vancraeynest-De Cuiper, José Garre-Rubio&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We propose a systematic framework to construct a (d+1)-dimensional stabilizer model from an initial generic d-dimensional abelian symmetry. Our approach builds upon the iterative gauging procedure, developed by one of the authors in [J. Garre-Rubio, Nature Commun. 15, 7986 (2024)], in which an initial symmetric state is repeatedly gauged to obtain an emergent model in one dimension higher that supports the initial symmetry at its boundary. This method not only enables the construction of emergent states and corresponding commuting stabilizer Hamiltonians of which they are ground states, but it also provides a way to construct gapped boundary conditions for these models that amount to spontaneously breaking part of the boundary symmetry. In a detailed introductory example, we showcase our paradigm by constructing three-dimensional Clifford-deformed surface codes from iteratively gauging a global 0-form symmetry that lives in two dimensions. We then provide a proof of our main result, hereby drawing upon a slight extension of the gauging procedure of Williamson. We additionally provide two more examples in d=2 in which different type-I fracton orders emerge from gauging initial linear subsystem and Sierpinski fractal symmetries. En passant, we provide explicit tensor network representations of all of the involved gauging maps and the emergent states.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09044'&gt;arXiv:2410.09044&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 11 Oct 2024 17:57:40 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Grassmann tensor renormalization group approach to $(1+1)$-dimensional two-color lattice QCD at finite density</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Kwok Ho Pai, Shinichiro Akiyama, Synge Todo&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We construct a Grassmann tensor network representing the partition function of (1+1)-dimensional two-color QCD with staggered fermions. The Grassmann path integral is rewritten as the trace of a Grassmann tensor network by introducing two-component auxiliary Grassmann fields on every edge of the lattice. We introduce an efficient initial tensor compression scheme to reduce the size of initial tensors. The Grassmann bond-weighted tensor renormalization group approach is adopted to evaluate the quark number density, fermion condensate, and diquark condensate at different gauge couplings as a function of the chemical potential. Different transition behavior is observed as the quark mass is varied. We discuss the efficiency of our initial tensor compression scheme and the future application toward the corresponding higher-dimensional models.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09485'&gt;arXiv:2410.09485&lt;/a&gt;] Published Sat, 12 Oct 2024 10:45:44 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Quantum many-body simulations with PauliStrings.jl</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Nicolas Loizeau, J. Clayton Peacock, Dries Sels&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We present the Julia package PauliStrings ( https://github.com/nicolasloizeau/PauliStrings.jl ) for quantum many-body simulations, which performs fast operations on the Pauli group by encoding Pauli strings in binary. All of the Pauli string algebra is encoded into low-level logic operations on integers, and is made efficient by various truncation methods which allow for systematic extrapolation of the results. We illustrate the effectiveness of our package by (i) performing Heisenberg time evolution through direct numerical integration and (ii) by constructing a Liouvillian Krylov space. We benchmark the results against tensor network methods, and we find our package performs favorably. In addition, we show that this representation allows for easy encoding of any geometry. We present results for chaotic and integrable spin systems in 1D as well as some examples in 2D. Currently, the main limitations are the inefficiency of representing non-trivial pure states (or other low-rank operators), as well as the need to introduce dissipation to probe long-time dynamics.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09654'&gt;arXiv:2410.09654&lt;/a&gt;] Published Sat, 12 Oct 2024 21:18:47 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Universal scaling laws in quantum-probabilistic machine learning by tensor network towards interpreting representation and generalization powers</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09703</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Sheng-Chen Bai, Shi-Ju Ran&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Interpreting the representation and generalization powers has been a long-standing issue in the field of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence. This work contributes to uncovering the emergence of universal scaling laws in quantum-probabilistic ML. We take the generative tensor network (GTN) in the form of a matrix product state as an example and show that with an untrained GTN (such as a random TN state), the negative logarithmic likelihood (NLL) $L$ generally increases linearly with the number of features $M$, i.e., $L \simeq k M + const$. This is a consequence of the so-called ``catastrophe of orthogonality,'' which states that quantum many-body states tend to become exponentially orthogonal to each other as $M$ increases. We reveal that while gaining information through training, the linear scaling law is suppressed by a negative quadratic correction, leading to $L \simeq \beta M - \alpha M^2 + const$. The scaling coefficients exhibit logarithmic relationships with the number of training samples and the number of quantum channels $\chi$. The emergence of the quadratic correction term in NLL for the testing (training) set can be regarded as evidence of the generalization (representation) power of GTN. Over-parameterization can be identified by the deviation in the values of $\alpha$ between training and testing sets while increasing $\chi$. We further investigate how orthogonality in the quantum feature map relates to the satisfaction of quantum probabilistic interpretation, as well as to the representation and generalization powers of GTN. The unveiling of universal scaling laws in quantum-probabilistic ML would be a valuable step toward establishing a white-box ML scheme interpreted within the quantum probabilistic framework.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09703'&gt;arXiv:2410.09703&lt;/a&gt;] Published Sun, 13 Oct 2024 02:48:08 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Towards LLM-guided Efficient and Interpretable Multi-linear Tensor Network Rank Selection</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Giorgos Iacovides, Wuyang Zhou, Danilo Mandic&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We propose a novel framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to guide the rank selection in tensor network models for higher-order data analysis. By utilising the intrinsic reasoning capabilities and domain knowledge of LLMs, our approach offers enhanced interpretability of the rank choices and can effectively optimise the objective function. This framework enables users without specialised domain expertise to utilise tensor network decompositions and understand the underlying rationale within the rank selection process. Experimental results validate our method on financial higher-order datasets, demonstrating interpretable reasoning, strong generalisation to unseen test data, and its potential for self-enhancement over successive iterations. This work is placed at the intersection of large language models and higher-order data analysis.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10728'&gt;arXiv:2410.10728&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 14 Oct 2024 17:09:14 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Equivalence checking of quantum circuits via intermediary matrix product operator</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Aaron Sander, Lukas Burgholzer, Robert Wille&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; As quantum computing advances, the complexity of quantum circuits is rapidly increasing, driving the need for robust methods to aid in their design. Equivalence checking plays a vital role in identifying errors that may arise during compilation and optimization of these circuits and is a critical step in quantum circuit verification. In this work, we introduce a novel method based on Matrix Product Operators (MPOs) for determining the equivalence of quantum circuits. Our approach contracts tensorized quantum gates from two circuits into an intermediary MPO, exploiting their reversibility to determine their equivalence or non-equivalence. Our results show that this method offers significant scalability improvements over existing methods, with polynomial scaling in circuit width and depth for the practical use cases we explore. We expect that this work sets the new standard for scalable equivalence checking of quantum circuits and will become a crucial tool for the validation of increasingly complex quantum systems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10946'&gt;arXiv:2410.10946&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 14 Oct 2024 18:00:00 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Dynamical freezing in the thermodynamic limit: the strongly driven ensemble</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11050</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Asmi Haldar, Anirban Das, Sagnik Chaudhuri, Luke Staszewski, Alexander Wietek, Frank Pollmann, Roderich Moessner, Arnab Das&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The ergodicity postulate, a foundational pillar of Gibbsian statistical mechanics predicts that a periodically driven (Floquet) system in the absence of any conservation law heats to a featureless `infinite temperature' state. Here, we find--for a clean and interacting generic spin chain subject to a {\it strong} driving field--that this can be prevented by the emergence of {\it approximate but stable} conservation-laws not present in the undriven system. We identify their origin: they do not necessarily owe their stability to familiar protections by symmetry, topology, disorder, or even high energy costs. We show numerically, {\it in the thermodynamic limit,} that when required by these emergent conservation-laws, the entanglement-entropy density of an infinite subsystem remains zero over our entire simulation time of several decades in natural units. We further provide a recipe for designing such conservation laws with high accuracy. Finally, we present an ensemble description, which we call the strongly driven ensemble incorporating these constraints. This provides a way to control many-body chaos through stable Floquet-engineering. Strong signatures of these conservation-laws should be experimentally accessible since they manifest in all length and time scales. Variants of the spin model we have used, have already been realized using Rydberg-dressed atoms.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11050'&gt;arXiv:2410.11050&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 14 Oct 2024 19:57:43 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Grassmann time-evolving matrix product operators: An efficient numerical approach for fermionic path integral simulations</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11541</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Xiansong Xu, Chu Guo, Ruofan Chen&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Developing numerical exact solvers for open quantum systems is a challenging task due to the non-perturbative and non-Markovian nature when coupling to structured environments. The Feynman-Vernon influence functional approach is a powerful analytical tool to study the dynamics of open quantum systems. Numerical treatments of the influence functional including the quasi-adiabatic propagator technique and the tensor-network-based time-evolving matrix product operator method, have proven to be efficient in studying open quantum systems with bosonic environments. However, the numerical implementation of the fermionic path integral suffers from the Grassmann algebra involved. In this work, we present a detailed introduction of the Grassmann time-evolving matrix product operator method for fermionic open quantum systems. In particular, we introduce the concepts of Grassmann tensor, signed matrix product operator, and Grassmann matrix product state to handle the Grassmann path integral. Using the single-orbital Anderson impurity model as an example, we review the numerical benchmarks for structured fermionic environments for real-time nonequilibrium dynamics, real-time and imaginary-time equilibration dynamics, and its application as an impurity solver. These benchmarks show that our method is a robust and promising numerical approach to study strong coupling physics and non-Markovian dynamics. It can also serve as an alternative impurity solver to study strongly-correlated quantum matter with dynamical mean-field theory.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11541'&gt;arXiv:2410.11541&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 15 Oct 2024 12:17:29 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Exploiting the Hermitian symmetry in tensor network algorithms</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Oscar van Alphen, Stijn V. Kleijweg, Juraj Hasik, Philippe Corboz&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Exploiting symmetries in tensor network algorithms plays a key role for reducing the computational and memory costs. Here we explain how to incorporate the Hermitian symmetry in double-layer tensor networks, which naturally arise in methods based on projected entangled-pair states (PEPS). For real-valued tensors the Hermitian symmetry defines a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry on the combined bra and ket auxiliary level of the tensors. By implementing this symmetry, a speedup of the computation time by up to a factor 4 can be achieved, while expectation values of observables and reduced density matrices remain Hermitian by construction. Benchmark results based on the corner transfer matrix renormalization group (CTMRG) and higher-order tensor renormalization group (HOTRG) are presented. We also discuss how to implement the Hermitian symmetry in the complex case, where a similar speedup can be achieved.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11596'&gt;arXiv:2410.11596&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 15 Oct 2024 13:31:36 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Wigner-Yanase skew information, quantum entanglement and spin nematic quantum phase transitions in biquadratic spin-1 and spin-2 XY chains with single-ion anisotropies</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11609</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Yan-Wei Dai, Sheng-Hao Li, Sam Young Cho, Huan-Qiang Zhou&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Quantum phase transitions (QPTs) between uniaxial or biaxial spin nematic (SN) phases are investigated in biquadratic spin-1 and spin-2 XY infinite chains with the rhombic- and uniaxial-type single-ion anisotropies. Systematic discussions of distinctive singular behaviors are made to classify various types of QPT from one SN state to the other SN state in using the Wigner-Yanase skew information (WYSI), the bipartite entanglement entropy (BEE), and the quadrupole moments (QMs). For the spin-1 system with the three uniaxial SN phases, we find that a discontinuous QPT, signaled by discontinuous behaviors of all the considered WYSI, BEE, and QMs, occurs from the z-ferroquadrupole phase (FQP) to the x- or y-FQPs, while a continuous QPT occurs between the x- and y-FQPs. The central charge in the continuous QPT line is estimated as $c \simeq 1$ from the BEE. Compared to the spin-1 system, depending on a given strength of the uniaxial-type single-ion anisotropy, the spin-2 system undergoes four different types of QPTs between the two biaxial SN phases as the rhombic-type anisotropy varies: the quantum crossovers, connecting the two orthogonal biaxial SN states adiabatically without an explicit phase transition, the continuous and the discontinuous QPTs, and the SN to magnetic transitions via the antiferromagnetic phase (AFP). In a sharp contrast to the spin-1 system, for the transitions between the two biaxial SN phases, the discontinuous transition line is classified as a topological phase characterized by a doubly degenerate entanglement spectrum and a string order parameter defined by the Cartan generator of the $\mathrm{SO}(5)$ symmetry group in spin-2 systems, while the continuous QPT is advocated by the central charge $c \simeq 1$. Whereas the QPT lines with $c \simeq 1/2$ indicate that the transition between the biaxial SN phase and the AFP belongs to the Ising universality class.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11609'&gt;arXiv:2410.11609&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 15 Oct 2024 13:45:52 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Non-unitarity maximizing unraveling of open quantum dynamics</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Ruben Daraban, Fabrizio Salas-Ramírez, Johannes Schachenmayer&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The dynamics of many-body quantum states in open systems is commonly numerically simulated by unraveling the density matrix into pure-state trajectories. In this work, we introduce a new unraveling strategy that can adaptively minimize the averaged entanglement in the trajectory states. This enables a more efficient classical representation of trajectories using matrix product decompositions. Our new approach is denoted non-unitarity maximizing unraveling (NUMU). It relies on the idea that adaptively maximizing the averaged non-unitarity of a set of Kraus operators leads to a more efficient trajectory entanglement destruction. Compared to other adaptive entanglement lowering algorithms, NUMU is computationally inexpensive. We demonstrate its utility in large-scale simulations with random quantum circuits. NUMU lowers runtimes in practical calculations, and it also provides new insight on the question of classical simulability of quantum dynamics. We show that for the quantum circuits considered here, unraveling methods are much less efficient than full matrix product density operator simulations, hinting to a still large potential for finding more advanced adaptive unraveling schemes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11690'&gt;arXiv:2410.11690&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 15 Oct 2024 15:25:39 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Intersublattice entanglement entropy of ferrimagnetic spin chains</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Jongmin Y. Lee, Se Kwon Kim&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Ferrimagnets are antiparallel-ordered magnetic states in a bipartite lattice with two alternating unequal spins, which exhibit both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic properties. Several theoretical studies have explored the magnetic properties of ferrimagnets, but the entanglement entropy of ferrimagnets with arbitrary spin combinations has not been studied. In this study, we analytically derive the intersublattice entanglement entropy of a ferrimagnetic spin chain using the method that has been applied to the antiferromagnetic case. The analytical results are numerically verified using the density matrix renormalization group. Going beyond the results for antiferromagnets, the entanglement entropy of ferrimagnets for fixed anisotropy is shown to solely depend on the difference of spins relative to its geometric average, and the quantity is shown to be stable against small parameter variations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12354'&gt;arXiv:2410.12354&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 16 Oct 2024 08:15:46 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Instability of steady-state mixed-state symmetry-protected topological order to strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Jeet Shah, Christopher Fechisin, Yu-Xin Wang, Joseph T. Iosue, James D. Watson, Yan-Qi Wang, Brayden Ware, Alexey V. Gorshkov, Cheng-Ju Lin&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Recent experimental progress in controlling open quantum systems enables the pursuit of mixed-state nonequilibrium quantum phases. We investigate whether open quantum systems hosting mixed-state symmetry-protected topological states as steady states retain this property under symmetric perturbations. Focusing on the decohered cluster state -- a mixed-state symmetry-protected topological state protected by a combined strong and weak symmetry -- we construct a parent Lindbladian that hosts it as a steady state. This Lindbladian can be mapped onto exactly solvable reaction-diffusion dynamics, even in the presence of certain perturbations, allowing us to solve the parent Lindbladian in detail and reveal previously-unknown steady states. Using both analytical and numerical methods, we find that typical symmetric perturbations cause strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking at arbitrarily small perturbations, destabilize the steady-state mixed-state symmetry-protected topological order. However, when perturbations introduce only weak symmetry defects, the steady-state mixed-state symmetry-protected topological order remains stable. Additionally, we construct a quantum channel which replicates the essential physics of the Lindbladian and can be efficiently simulated using only Clifford gates, Pauli measurements, and feedback.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12900'&gt;arXiv:2410.12900&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 16 Oct 2024 18:00:00 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Certifying steady-state properties of open quantum systems</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Luke Mortimer, Donato Farina, Grazia Di Bello, David Jansen, Andreas Leitherer, Pere Mujal, Antonio Acín&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Estimating the steady-state properties of open many-body quantum systems is a fundamental challenge in quantum science and technologies. In this work, we present a scalable approach based on semi-definite programming to derive certified bounds on the expectation value of an arbitrary observable in the steady state of Lindbladian dynamics. We illustrate our method on a series of many-body systems, including paradigmatic spin-1/2 chains and two-dimensional ladders, considering both equilibrium and nonequilibrium steady-states. We benchmark our method with state-of-the-art tensor-network approaches that, unlike our method, are only able to provide estimates, with no guarantee, on steady-state quantities. For the tested models, only modest computational effort is needed to obtain certified non-trivial bounds for system sizes intractable by exact methods. Our method introduces the first general numerical tool for bounding steady-state properties of open quantum dynamics, opening a new avenue in the understanding of stable configurations in many-body systems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13646'&gt;arXiv:2410.13646&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 17 Oct 2024 15:13:12 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Dynamical correlations and nonequilibrium sum rules in photodoped Hubbard ladders</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13664</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; E. Merhej, J. P. Hague, R. M. Konik, A. J. A. James&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Using matrix product state techniques we study the nonequilibrium dynamical response of the half-filled Hubbard ladder when subject to an optical pump. Optical pumping offers a way of producing and manipulating new strongly correlated phenomena by suppressing existing magnetic correlations. The ladder allows the effects of pump directionality to be investigated, and compared to a single chain it has strong spin-charge coupling and a fully gapped excitation spectrum, promising different nonequilibrium physics. We compute time-dependent correlations, including the nonequilibrium dynamical structure factors for spin and charge. By deriving a combined spin-charge sum rule that applies both in and out-of-equilibrium, we show that spectral weight is pumped directly from the antiferromagnetic spin response into a low energy $\omega\sim 0$ charge response below the Mott gap. The transfer of weight is pump direction dependent: pumping directed along the legs disrupts magnetic correlations more than pumping in the rung direction, even if the post pump energy density is similar. The charge correlation length is dramatically enhanced by the pump, whilst the spin correlations are most strongly suppressed at nearest and next-nearest neighbour spacings. After the pump the system is in a nonthermal correlated metallic state, with gapless charge excitations and approximately equal spin and charge correlation lengths, emphasising the importance of treating these degrees of freedom on an equal footing in nonequilibrium systems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13664'&gt;arXiv:2410.13664&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 17 Oct 2024 15:26:14 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking meets average symmetry-protected topological order</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13734</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Yuchen Guo, Shuo Yang&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Recent studies have unveiled new possibilities for discovering intrinsic quantum phases that are unique to open systems, including phases with average symmetry-protected topological (ASPT) order and strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking (SWSSB) order in systems with global symmetry. In this work, we propose a new class of phases, termed the double ASPT phase, which emerges from a nontrivial extension of these two orders. This new phase is absent from prior studies and cannot exist in conventional closed systems. Using the recently developed imaginary-Lindbladian formalism, we explore the phase diagram of a one-dimensional open system with $\mathbb{Z}_2^{\sigma}\times \mathbb{Z}_2^{\tau}$ symmetry. We identify universal critical behaviors along each critical line and observe the emergence of an intermediate phase that completely breaks the $\mathbb{Z}_2^{\sigma}$ symmetry, leading to the formation of two triple points in the phase diagram. These two triple points are topologically distinct and connected by a domain-wall decoration duality map. Our results promote the establishment of a complete classification for quantum phases in open systems with various symmetry conditions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13734'&gt;arXiv:2410.13734&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 17 Oct 2024 16:36:53 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Post-measurement Quantum Monte Carlo</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13844</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Kriti Baweja, David J. Luitz, Samuel J. Garratt&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We show how the effects of large numbers of measurements on many-body quantum ground and thermal states can be studied using Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC). Density matrices generated by measurement in this setting feature products of many local nonunitary operators, and by expanding these density matrices as sums over operator strings we arrive at a generalized stochastic series expansion (SSE). Our 'post-measurement SSE' is based on importance sampling of operator strings contributing to a measured thermal density matrix. We demonstrate our algorithm by probing the effects of measurements on the spin-1/2 Heisenberg antiferromagnet on the square lattice. Thermal states of this system have SU(2) symmetry, and at first we preserve this symmetry by measuring SU(2) symmetric observables. We identify classes of post-measurement states for which correlations can be calculated efficiently, as well as states for which SU(2) symmetric measurements generate a QMC sign problem when working in any site-local basis. For the first class, we show how deterministic loop updates can be leveraged. Using our algorithm we demonstrate the creation of long-range Bell pairs and symmetry-protected topological order, as well as the measurement-induced enhancement of antiferromagnetic correlations. We then study the effects of measuring the system in a basis where the standard (unmeasured) SSE is sign-free: For measurement schemes with this property, we can calculate correlations in all post-measurement states without a sign problem. The method developed in this work opens the door to scalable experimental probes of measurement-induced collective phenomena, which require numerical estimates for the effects of measurements.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13844'&gt;arXiv:2410.13844&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 17 Oct 2024 17:57:11 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Influence of oxygen orbitals and boundary conditions on the pairing behavior in the Emery model for doped ladders</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14280</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Gökmen Polat, Eric Jeckelmann&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We investigate the Emery model on several ladder-like lattices including two legs of copper d-orbitals and various numbers of oxygen p-orbitals. Pair binding energy, pair spatial structure, density distribution, and pairing correlation functions are calculated using the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG). We show that a Luther-Emery phase with enhanced pairing correlations can be found for hole doping as well as for electron doping with realistic model parameters. Ladder properties depend sensitively on model parameters, the oxygen p-orbitals taken into account, and boundary conditions. The pair binding energy is a more reliable quantity than correlation functions for studying pairing in ladders. Overall, our results for two-leg Emery ladders support the possibility of superconductivity in the hole-doped 2D model. The issue is rather to determine which of the various ladder structures and model parameters are appropriate to approximate the two-dimensional cuprates.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14280'&gt;arXiv:2410.14280&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 18 Oct 2024 08:37:02 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Universal quantum computation using Ising anyons from a non-semisimple Topological Quantum Field Theory</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Filippo Iulianelli, Sung Kim, Joshua Sussan, Aaron D. Lauda&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We propose a framework for topological quantum computation using newly discovered non-semisimple analogs of topological quantum field theories in 2+1 dimensions. These enhanced theories offer more powerful models for quantum computation. The conventional theory of Ising anyons, which is believed to describe excitations in the $\nu = 5/2$ fractional quantum Hall state, is not universal for quantum computation via braiding of quasiparticles. However, we show that the non-semisimple theory introduces new anyon types that extend the Ising framework. By adding just one new anyon type, universal quantum computation can be achieved through braiding alone. This result opens new avenues for realizing fault-tolerant quantum computing in topologically ordered systems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14860'&gt;arXiv:2410.14860&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 18 Oct 2024 21:03:07 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Quantum-Classical Computing via Tensor Networks</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15080</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Nathaniel Tornow, Christian B. Mendl, Pramod Bhatotia&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Circuit knitting offers a promising path to the scalable execution of large quantum circuits by breaking them into smaller sub-circuits whose output is recombined through classical postprocessing. However, current techniques face excessive overhead due to a naive postprocessing method that neglects potential optimizations in the circuit structure. To overcome this, we introduce qTPU, a framework for scalable hybrid quantum-classical processing using tensor networks. By leveraging our hybrid quantum circuit contraction method, we represent circuit execution as the contraction of a hybrid tensor network (h-TN). The qTPU compiler automates efficient h-TN generation, optimizing the balance between estimated error and postprocessing overhead, while the qTPU runtime supports large-scale h-TN contraction using quantum and classical accelerators. Our evaluation shows orders-of-magnitude reductions in postprocessing overhead, a $10^4\times$ speedup in postprocessing, and a 20.7$\times$ reduction in overall runtime compared to the state-of-the-art Qiskit-Addon-Cutting (QAC).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15080'&gt;arXiv:2410.15080&lt;/a&gt;] Published Sat, 19 Oct 2024 11:57:05 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Augmenting Finite Temperature Tensor Network with Clifford Circuits</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15709</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Xiangjian Qian, Jiale Huang, Mingpu Qin&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Recent studies have highlighted the combination of tensor network methods and the stabilizer formalism as a very effective framework for simulating quantum many-body systems, encompassing areas from ground state to time evolution simulations. In these approaches, the entanglement associated with stabilizers is transferred to Clifford circuits, which can be efficiently managed due to the Gottesman-Knill theorem. Consequently, only the non-stabilizerness entanglement needs to be handled, thereby reducing the computational resources required for accurate simulations of quantum many-body systems in tensor network related methods. In this work, we adapt this paradigm for finite temperature simulations in the framework of Time-Dependent Variational Principle, in which imaginary time evolution is performed using the purification scheme. Our numerical results on the one-dimensional Heisenberg model and the two-dimensional $J_1-J_2$ Heisenberg model demonstrate that Clifford circuits can significantly improve the efficiency and accuracy of finite temperature simulations for quantum many-body systems. This improvement not only provides a useful tool for calculating finite temperature properties of quantum many-body systems, but also paves the way for further advancements in boosting the finite temperature tensor network calculations with Clifford circuits and other quantum circuits.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15709'&gt;arXiv:2410.15709&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 21 Oct 2024 07:30:59 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Robust Low-rank Tensor Train Recovery</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15224</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Zhen Qin, Zhihui Zhu&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Tensor train (TT) decomposition represents an $N$-order tensor using $O(N)$ matrices (i.e., factors) of small dimensions, achieved through products among these factors. Due to its compact representation, TT decomposition has found wide applications, including various tensor recovery problems in signal processing and quantum information. In this paper, we study the problem of reconstructing a TT format tensor from measurements that are contaminated by outliers with arbitrary values. Given the vulnerability of smooth formulations to corruptions, we use an $\ell_1$ loss function to enhance robustness against outliers. We first establish the $\ell_1/\ell_2$-restricted isometry property (RIP) for Gaussian measurement operators, demonstrating that the information in the TT format tensor can be preserved using a number of measurements that grows linearly with $N$. We also prove the sharpness property for the $\ell_1$ loss function optimized over TT format tensors. Building on the $\ell_1/\ell_2$-RIP and sharpness property, we then propose two complementary methods to recover the TT format tensor from the corrupted measurements: the projected subgradient method (PSubGM), which optimizes over the entire tensor, and the factorized Riemannian subgradient method (FRSubGM), which optimizes directly over the factors. Compared to PSubGM, the factorized approach FRSubGM significantly reduces the memory cost at the expense of a slightly slower convergence rate. Nevertheless, we show that both methods, with diminishing step sizes, converge linearly to the ground-truth tensor given an appropriate initialization, which can be obtained by a truncated spectral method.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15224'&gt;arXiv:2410.15224&lt;/a&gt;] Published Sat, 19 Oct 2024 21:59:50 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Quantum inspired factorization up to 100-bit RSA number in polynomial time</title>

The security of this protocol is based on the exponential computational complexity of the most efficient classical algorithms for factoring large semiprime numbers into their two prime components. Here, we attack RSA factorization building on Schnorr's mathematical framework where factorization translates into a combinatorial optimization problem. We solve the optimization task via tensor network methods, a quantum-inspired classical numerical technique. This tensor network Schnorr's sieving algorithm displays numerical evidence of a polynomial scaling of the resources with the bit-length of the semiprime. We factorize RSA numbers up to 100 bits encoding the optimization problem in quantum systems with up to 256 qubits. Only the high-order polynomial scaling of the required resources limits the factorization of larger numbers. Although these results do not currently undermine the security of the present communication infrastructure, they strongly highlight the urgency of implementing post-quantum cryptography or quantum key distribution.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16355'&gt;arXiv:2410.16355&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 21 Oct 2024 18:00:00 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

We introduce a Haagerup version of the anyonic spin chain and use the boost operator formalism to identify two integrable Hamiltonians of PXP type on this chain. The first of these is an analogue of the golden chain; it has a topological symmetry based on $H_3$ and satisfies the Temperley-Lieb algebra with parameter $\delta=(3+\sqrt{13})/2$. We prove its integrability using a Lax formalism, and construct the corresponding solution to the Yang--Baxter equation. We present numerical evidence that this model is gapless with a dynamical critical exponent $z\neq 1$. The second integrable model we find breaks the topological symmetry. We present numerical evidence that this model reduces to a CFT in the large volume limit with central charge $c\sim3/2$.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16356'&gt;arXiv:2410.16356&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 21 Oct 2024 18:00:00 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Luke Staszewski, Alexander Wietek&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We investigate the fundamental dynamical process of an initial quench of the chemical potential of the two-dimensional $t$-$J$ model. Depending on the ground state phase, sharply different dynamical behavior of the charge distribution and entanglement properties are observed. In the stripe phase, the intertwining of the spin and charge density waves remains stable under time evolution. A ballistic spreading of the charge density is observed with a propagation speed that is only weakly dependent on the coupling ratio, $J/t$. Moreover, in the phase-separated regime for large $J/t$, we report a complete dynamical freezing of charge degrees of freedom within, where even under long time evolution the entanglement entropy remains bounded. Our results are obtained by combining large-scale exact diagonalizations and matrix product state techniques for time evolution.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16387'&gt;arXiv:2410.16387&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 21 Oct 2024 18:01:27 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Quantum thermodynamics of integrable and near-integrable atomic systems</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16771</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Raymon S. Watson&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; In this thesis, we explore various aspects of equilibrium and nonequilibrium thermodynamics for ultracold atomic gases, with a focus on the experimentally realisable one-dimensional (1D) Bose gas. This is a paradigmatic example of an interacting many-body system, which is integrable in the uniform limit and near-integrable otherwise. We first investigate a quantum thermodynamic Otto cycle driven by a quench of interaction strength of a 1D Bose gas. For the case of a sudden quench in a uniform 1D Bose gas, we demonstrate how the performance of this highly nonequilibrium quantum thermal machine may be expressed in terms of atom-atom correlations. Further, we derive a new Maxwell relation which allows one to express entropy, which is generally difficult to ascertain in quantum systems, in terms of Glauber's local second-order correlation function, which are experimentally measurable. We next perform benchmarks of GHD in order to ascertain the regimes where such a theory may be applied, and then utilize it to investigate the interaction strength-driven quantum Otto cycle in a harmonically trapped 1D Bose gas. However, to realise such an engine in an experimentally realistic manner would require modelling thermalisation with external reservoirs, which is currently beyond the scope of GHD. Yet, the classical $c$-field stochastic-projected Gross-Pitaevskii equation (SPGPE) method is capable of simulating tunnel-coupling pairs of 1D Bose gases in the weakly interacting regime. We therefore utilise this numerical method to simulate the \emph{full} quantum Otto engine cycle, realised through a single working fluid tunnel-coupled to two 1D Bose gases, which constitute the external (hot and cold) reservoirs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16771'&gt;arXiv:2410.16771&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 22 Oct 2024 07:40:26 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Quantum Large Language Models via Tensor Network Disentanglers</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17397</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Borja Aizpurua, Saeed S. Jahromi, Sukhbinder Singh, Roman Orus&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We propose a method to enhance the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) by integrating quantum computing and quantum-inspired techniques. Specifically, our approach involves replacing the weight matrices in the Self-Attention and Multi-layer Perceptron layers with a combination of two variational quantum circuits and a quantum-inspired tensor network, such as a Matrix Product Operator (MPO). This substitution enables the reproduction of classical LLM functionality by decomposing weight matrices through the application of tensor network disentanglers and MPOs, leveraging well-established tensor network techniques. By incorporating more complex and deeper quantum circuits, along with increasing the bond dimensions of the MPOs, our method captures additional correlations within the quantum-enhanced LLM, leading to improved accuracy beyond classical models while maintaining low memory overhead.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17397'&gt;arXiv:2410.17397&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 22 Oct 2024 20:12:04 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Faster Language Models with Better Multi-Token Prediction Using Tensor Decomposition</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17765</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Artem Basharin, Andrei Chertkov, Ivan Oseledets&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We propose a new model for multi-token prediction in transformers, aiming to enhance sampling efficiency without compromising accuracy. Motivated by recent work that predicts the probabilities of subsequent tokens using multiple heads, we connect this approach to rank-$1$ canonical tensor decomposition. By generalizing it to a rank-$r$ canonical probability decomposition, we develop an improved model that predicts multiple tokens simultaneously. This model can also be interpreted as a mixture of experts, allowing us to leverage successful techniques from that domain for efficient and robust training. Importantly, the overall overhead for training and sampling remains low. Our method demonstrates significant improvements in inference speed for both text and code generation tasks, proving particularly beneficial within the self-speculative decoding paradigm. It maintains its effectiveness across various model sizes and training epochs, highlighting its robustness and scalability.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17765'&gt;arXiv:2410.17765&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 23 Oct 2024 11:06:36 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Anyon Superconductivity from Topological Criticality in a Hofstadter-Hubbard Model</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18175</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Stefan Divic, Valentin Crépel, Tomohiro Soejima, Xue-Yang Song, Andrew J. Millis, Michael P. Zaletel, Ashvin Vishwanath&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We argue that the combination of strong repulsive interactions and high magnetic fields can generate electron pairing and superconductivity. Inspired by the large lattice constants of moiré materials, which make large flux per unit cell accessible at laboratory fields, we study the triangular lattice Hofstadter-Hubbard model at one-quarter flux quantum per plaquette, where previous literature has argued that a chiral spin liquid separates a weak-coupling integer quantum Hall phase and a strong-coupling topologically-trivial antiferromagnetic insulator at a density of one electron per site. We argue that topological superconductivity emerges upon doping in the vicinity of the integer quantum Hall to chiral spin liquid transition. We employ exact diagonalization and density matrix renormalization group methods to examine this theoretical scenario and find that electronic pairing indeed occurs on both sides of criticality over a remarkably broad range of interaction strengths. On the chiral spin liquid side, our results provide a concrete model realization of the long-hypothesized mechanism of anyon superconductivity. Our study thus establishes a beyond-BCS mechanism for electron pairing in a well-controlled limit, relying crucially on the interplay between electron correlations and band topology.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18175'&gt;arXiv:2410.18175&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 23 Oct 2024 18:00:01 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Irregular Tensor Low-Rank Representation for Hyperspectral Image Representation</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18388</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Bo Han, Yuheng Jia, Hui Liu, Junhui Hou&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Spectral variations pose a common challenge in analyzing hyperspectral images (HSI). To address this, low-rank tensor representation has emerged as a robust strategy, leveraging inherent correlations within HSI data. However, the spatial distribution of ground objects in HSIs is inherently irregular, existing naturally in tensor format, with numerous class-specific regions manifesting as irregular tensors. Current low-rank representation techniques are designed for regular tensor structures and overlook this fundamental irregularity in real-world HSIs, leading to performance limitations. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel model for irregular tensor low-rank representation tailored to efficiently model irregular 3D cubes. By incorporating a non-convex nuclear norm to promote low-rankness and integrating a global negative low-rank term to enhance the discriminative ability, our proposed model is formulated as a constrained optimization problem and solved using an alternating augmented Lagrangian method. Experimental validation conducted on four public datasets demonstrates the superior performance of our method compared to existing state-of-the-art approaches. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/hb-studying/ITLRR.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18388'&gt;arXiv:2410.18388&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 24 Oct 2024 02:56:22 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Low-Rank Tensor Learning by Generalized Nonconvex Regularization</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18402</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Sijia Xia, Michael K. Ng, Xiongjun Zhang&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; In this paper, we study the problem of low-rank tensor learning, where only a few of training samples are observed and the underlying tensor has a low-rank structure. The existing methods are based on the sum of nuclear norms of unfolding matrices of a tensor, which may be suboptimal. In order to explore the low-rankness of the underlying tensor effectively, we propose a nonconvex model based on transformed tensor nuclear norm for low-rank tensor learning. Specifically, a family of nonconvex functions are employed onto the singular values of all frontal slices of a tensor in the transformed domain to characterize the low-rankness of the underlying tensor. An error bound between the stationary point of the nonconvex model and the underlying tensor is established under restricted strong convexity on the loss function (such as least squares loss and logistic regression) and suitable regularity conditions on the nonconvex penalty function. By reformulating the nonconvex function into the difference of two convex functions, a proximal majorization-minimization (PMM) algorithm is designed to solve the resulting model. Then the global convergence and convergence rate of PMM are established under very mild conditions. Numerical experiments are conducted on tensor completion and binary classification to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method over other state-of-the-art methods.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18402'&gt;arXiv:2410.18402&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 24 Oct 2024 03:33:20 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Operator entanglement in $\mathrm{SU}(2)$-symmetric dissipative quantum many-body dynamics</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18468</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Lin Zhang&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The presence of symmetries can lead to nontrivial dynamics of operator entanglement in open quantum many-body systems, which characterizes the cost of an matrix product density operator (MPDO) representation of the density matrix in the tensor-network methods and provides a measure for the corresponding classical simulability. One example is the $\mathrm{U}(1)$-symmetric open quantum systems with dephasing, in which the operator entanglement increases logarithmically at late times instead of being suppressed by the dephasing. Here we numerically study the far-from-equilibrium dynamics of operator entanglement in a dissipative quantum many-body system with the more complicated $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ symmetry and dissipations beyond dephasing. We show that after the initial rise and fall, the operator entanglement also increases again in a logarithmic manner at late times in the $\mathrm{SU}(2)$-symmetric case. We find that this behavior can be fully understood from the corresponding $\mathrm{U}(1)$ subsymmetry by considering the symmetry-resolved operator entanglement. But unlike the $\mathrm{U}(1)$-symmetric case with dephasing, both the classical Shannon entropy associated with the probabilities for the half system being in different symmetry sectors and the corresponding symmetry-resolved operator entanglement have nontrivial contributions to the late time logarithmic growth of operator entanglement. Our results show evidence that the logarithmic growth of operator entanglement at long times is a generic behavior of dissipative quantum many-body dynamics with $\mathrm{U}(1)$ as the symmetry or subsymmetry and for more broad dissipations beyond dephasing. By breaking the $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ symmetry of our quantum many-body dynamics to $\mathrm{U}(1)$, we also show that the latter property is valid even for open quantum systems with only $\mathrm{U}(1)$ symmetry.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18468'&gt;arXiv:2410.18468&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 24 Oct 2024 06:33:15 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Variational Tensor Network Simulation of Gaussian Boson Sampling and Beyond</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Jonas Vinther, Michael James Kastoryano&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The continuous variable quantum computing platform constitutes a promising candidate for realizing quantum advantage, as exemplified in Gaussian Boson Sampling. While noise in the experiments makes the computation attainable for classical simulations, it has been suggested that the addition of non-linear elements to the experiment will help retain the quantum advantage. We propose a classical simulation tool for general continuous variable sampling problems, including Gaussian Boson Sampling and beyond. We reformulate the sampling problem as that of finding the ground state of a simple few-body Hamiltonian. This allows us to employ powerful variational methods based on tensor networks and to read off the simulation error directly from the expectation value of the Hamiltonian. We validate our method by simulating Gaussian Boson Sampling, where we achieve results comparable to the state of the art. We also consider a non-Gaussian sampling problem, for which we develop novel local basis optimization techniques based on a non-linear parameterization of the implicit basis, resulting in high effective cutoffs with diminished computational overhead.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18740'&gt;arXiv:2410.18740&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 24 Oct 2024 13:43:06 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>From $SU(2)$ holonomies to holographic duality via tensor networks</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Grzegorz Czelusta, Jakub Mielczarek&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Tensor networks provide a powerful tool for studying many-body quantum systems, particularly making quantum simulations more efficient. In this article, we construct a tensor network representation of the spin network states, which correspond to $SU(2)$ gauge-invariant discrete field theories. Importantly, the spin network states play a central role in the Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG) approach to the Planck scale physics. Our focus is on the Ising-type spin networks, which provide a basic model of quantum space in LQG. It is shown that the tensor network approach improves the previously introduced methods of constructing quantum circuits for the Ising spin networks by reducing the number of qubits involved. It is also shown that the tensor network approach is convenient for implementing holographic states involving the bulk-boundary conjecture, which contributes to establishing a link between LQG and holographic duality.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18812'&gt;arXiv:2410.18812&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 24 Oct 2024 14:59:35 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Quantum Many-Body Scars beyond the PXP model in Rydberg simulators</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18913</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Aron Kerschbaumer, Marko Ljubotina, Maksym Serbyn, Jean-Yves Desaules&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Persistent revivals recently observed in Rydberg atom simulators have challenged our understanding of thermalization and attracted much interest to the concept of quantum many-body scars (QMBSs). QMBSs are non-thermal highly excited eigenstates that coexist with typical eigenstates in the spectrum of many-body Hamiltonians, and have since been reported in multiple theoretical models, including the so-called PXP model, approximately realized by Rydberg simulators. At the same time, questions of how common QMBSs are and in what models they are physically realized remain open. In this Letter, we demonstrate that QMBSs exist in a broader family of models that includes and generalizes PXP to longer-range constraints and states with different periodicity. We show that in each model, multiple QMBS families can be found. Each of them relies on a different approximate $\mathfrak{su}(2)$ algebra, leading to oscillatory dynamics in all cases. However, in contrast to the PXP model, their observation requires launching dynamics from weakly entangled initial states rather than from a product state. QMBSs reported here may be experimentally probed using Rydberg atom simulator in the regime of longer-range Rydberg blockades.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18913'&gt;arXiv:2410.18913&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 24 Oct 2024 17:04:42 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>More on the Operator Space Entanglement (OSE): Rényi OSE, revivals, and integrability breaking</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18930</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Vincenzo Alba&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We investigate the dynamics of the Rényi Operator Space Entanglement ($OSE$) entropies $S_n$ across several one-dimensional integrable and chaotic models. As a paradigmatic integrable system, we first consider the so-called rule $54$ chain. Our numerical results reveal that the Rényi $OSE$ entropies of diagonal operators with nonzero trace saturate at long times, in contrast with the behavior of von Neumann entropy. Oppositely, the Rényi entropies of traceless operators exhibit logarithmic growth with time, with the prefactor of this growth depending in a nontrivial manner on $n$. Notably, at long times, the complete operator entanglement spectrum ($ES$) of an operator can be reconstructed from the spectrum of its traceless part. We observe a similar pattern in the $XXZ$ chain, suggesting universal behavior. Additionally, we consider dynamics in nonintegrable deformations of the $XXZ$ chain. Finite-time corrections do not allow to access the long-time behavior of the von Neumann entropy. On the other hand, for $n&gt;1$ the growth of the entropies is milder, and it is compatible with a sublinear growth, at least for operators associated with global conserved quantities. Finally, we show that in finite-size integrable systems, $S_n$ exhibit strong revivals, which are washed out when integrability is broken.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18930'&gt;arXiv:2410.18930&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 24 Oct 2024 17:17:29 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Internal structure of gauge-invariant Projected Entangled Pair States</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18947</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; David Blanik, José Garre-Rubio, András Molnár, Erez Zohar&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Projected entangled pair states (PEPS) are very useful in the description of strongly correlated systems, partly because they allow encoding symmetries, either global or local (gauge), naturally. In recent years, PEPS with local symmetries have increasingly been used in the study of non-perturbative regimes of lattice gauge theories, most prominently as a way to construct variational ansatz states depending only on a small number of parameters and yet capturing the relevant physical properties. For the case of one-dimensional PEPS (Matrix Product States - MPS) a bidirectional connection was established between the internal structure of the tensor network, i.e. the mathematical properties of the constituent tensors, and the symmetry. In higher dimensions this has only been done for global symmetries, where in the local (gauge) case it is known only how to construct gauge-invariant states, but not what the symmetry implies on the internal structure of the PEPS. In the present work we complete this missing piece and study the internal structure of projected entangled pair states with a gauge symmetry. The PEPS we consider consist of matter and gauge field tensors placed on the vertices and edges, respectively, of arbitrary graphs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18947'&gt;arXiv:2410.18947&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 24 Oct 2024 17:37:37 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

Ignacio Cirac&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Tensor network methods have proved to be highly effective in addressing a wide variety of physical scenarios, including those lacking an intrinsic one-dimensional geometry. In such contexts, it is possible for the problem to exhibit a weak form of permutational symmetry, in the sense that entanglement behaves similarly across any arbitrary bipartition. In this paper, we show that translationally-invariant (TI) matrix product states (MPS) with this property are trivial, meaning that they are either product states or superpositions of a few of them. The results also apply to non-TI generic MPS, as well as further relevant examples of MPS including the W state and the Dicke states in an approximate sense. Our findings motivate the usage of ansätze simpler than tensor networks in systems whose structure is invariant under permutations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19541'&gt;arXiv:2410.19541&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 25 Oct 2024 13:13:23 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Solving quantum impurity models in the non-equilibrium steady state with tensor trains</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Martin Eckstein&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We discuss the evaluation of the integrals for intermediate-order diagrams in the self-consistent strong-coupling expansion on the Keldysh contour using Tensor Cross Interpolation (TCI). TCI is used to factorize the nested parts of the integrand, allowing the integral to be computed as a recursion of convolution integrals, which are efficiently evaluated using the Fast Fourier Transform. The evaluation of diagrams where all vertices lie on one branch of the Keldysh contour resembles the structure of the imaginary-time formalism. For diagrams with time arguments on both contour branches, we find that it can be advantageous to parametrize the integrals in terms of physical time arguments with an additional sum over Keldysh indices. We benchmark the solution in relevant test cases, including the single impurity Anderson model and an exactly solvable electron-boson model. While the bond dimension increases with diagram order, the TCI-based integration efficiently handles low-order diagrams, making it a promising approach to go beyond the non-crossing approximation in steady-state non-equilibrium dynamical mean-field theory simulations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19707'&gt;arXiv:2410.19707&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 25 Oct 2024 17:30:01 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

This represents a significant improvement compared with the conventional approach, where the computational complexity scales as $\chi^4$ and memory requirements scale as $\chi^3$.We benchmark the TTM algorithm using flows obtained from artificial turbulence generation and numerically demonstrate its improved runtime and memory scaling compared with the conventional approach. The TTM algorithm paves the way towards GPU accelerated tensor network simulations of computational fluid dynamics problems with large bond dimensions due to its dramatic improvement in memory scaling.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19747'&gt;arXiv:2410.19747&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 10 Oct 2024 12:36:49 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

One of the key issues for long-sequence modeling using attention-based model is the mismatch between the limited-range modeling power of full attention and the long-range token dependency in the input sequence. In this work, we propose to scale up the attention receptive field by tensorizing long input sequences into compact tensor representations followed by attention on each transformed dimension. The resulting Tensorized Attention can be adopted as efficient transformer backbones to extend input context length with improved memory and time efficiency. We show that the proposed attention tensorization encodes token dependencies as a multi-hop attention process, and is equivalent to Kronecker decomposition of full attention. Extensive experiments show that tensorized attention can be used to adapt pretrained LLMs with improved efficiency. Notably, Llama-8B with tensorization is trained under 32,768 context length and can steadily extrapolate to 128k length during inference with $11\times$ speedup, compared to full attention with FlashAttention-2.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20926'&gt;arXiv:2410.20926&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 28 Oct 2024 11:08:57 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Spin-1 Haldane phase in a chain of Rydberg atoms</title>

Büchler&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We present a protocol to implement a spin-1 chain in Rydberg systems using three Rydberg states close to a Förster resonance. In addition to dipole-dipole interactions, strong van der Waals interactions naturally appear due to the presence of the Förster resonance and give rise to a highly tunable Hamiltonian. The resulting phase diagram is studied using the infinite density-matrix renormalization group and reveals a highly robust Haldane phase -- a prime example of a symmetry protected topological phase. We find experimentally accessible parameters to probe the Haldane phase in current Rydberg systems, and demonstrate an efficient adiabatic preparation scheme. This paves the way to probe the remarkable properties of spin fractionalization in the Haldane phase.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21424'&gt;arXiv:2410.21424&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 28 Oct 2024 18:16:20 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Nearly tight bounds for testing tree tensor network states</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21417</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Benjamin Lovitz, Angus Lowe&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Tree tensor network states (TTNS) generalize the notion of having low Schmidt-rank to multipartite quantum states, through a parameter known as the bond dimension. This leads to succinct representations of quantum many-body systems with a tree-like entanglement structure. In this work, we study the task of testing whether an unknown pure state is a TTNS on $n$ qudits with bond dimension at most $r$, or is far in trace distance from any such state. We first establish that, independent of the physical dimensions, $O(nr^2)$ copies of the state suffice to acccomplish this task with one-sided error, as in the matrix product state (MPS) test of Soleimanifar and Wright. We then prove that $\Omega(n r^2/\log n)$ copies are necessary for any test with one-sided error whenever $r\geq 2 + \log n$. In particular, this closes a quadratic gap in the previous bounds for MPS testing in this setting, up to log factors. On the other hand, when $r=2$ we show that $\Theta(\sqrt{n})$ copies are both necessary and sufficient for the related task of testing whether a state is a product of $n$ bipartite states having Schmidt-rank at most $r$, for some choice of physical dimensions. We also study the performance of tests using measurements performed on a small number of copies at a time. In the setting of one-sided error, we prove that adaptive measurements offer no improvement over non-adaptive measurements for many properties, including TTNS. We then derive a closed-form solution for the acceptance probability of an $(r+1)$-copy rank test with rank parameter $r$. This leads to nearly tight bounds for testing rank, Schmidt-rank, and TTNS when the tester is restricted to making measurements on $r+1$ copies at a time. For example, when $r=2$ there is an MPS test with one-sided error which uses $O(n^2)$ copies and measurements performed on just three copies at a time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21417'&gt;arXiv:2410.21417&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 28 Oct 2024 18:13:38 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Harnessing spin-qubit decoherence to probe strongly-interacting quantum systems</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22003</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Marcin Płodzień, Sambunath Das, Maciej Lewenstein, Christina Psaroudaki, Katarzyna Roszak&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Extracting information from quantum many-body systems remains a key challenge in quantum technologies due to experimental limitations. In this work, we employ a single spin qubit to probe a strongly interacting system, creating an environment conducive to qubit decoherence. By focusing on the XXZ spin chain, we observe diverse dynamics in the qubit evolution, reflecting different parameters of the chain. This demonstrates that a spin qubit can probe both quantitative properties of the spin chain and qualitative characteristics, such as the bipartite entanglement entropy, phase transitions, and perturbation propagation velocity within the system. This approach reveals the power of small quantum systems to probe the properties of large, strongly correlated quantum systems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22003'&gt;arXiv:2410.22003&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 29 Oct 2024 12:51:55 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Quantum Simulation of Spin-1 XXZ-Heisenberg Models and the Haldane Phase with Dysprosium</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22216</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Katharina Brechtelsbauer, Johannes Mögerle, Hans Peter Büchler&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Dysprosium atoms have proven to be a promising platform for quantum simulation due to their strong magnetic moment and high tunability of interactions. In this work, we propose Dysprosium atoms for simulating the one-dimensional spin-1 XXZ-Heisenberg model, which is known to have a rich phase diagram including the famous Haldane phase. To realize the model, we make use of the strong dipolar exchange interactions that naturally occur in the ground state of Dysprosium due to its large electron angular momentum of J=8. To implement spin-1 particles, we encode the spin degree of freedom into three Zeeman sublevels, which are energetically isolated by applying a magnetic field. Using the density-matrix renormalization group, we analyze the ground-state properties of the resulting effective model. We find that a chain of fermionic Dysprosium atoms in a suitable magnetic field can form a Haldane state with the characteristic spin-1/2 edge modes. Furthermore, we discuss the use of AC Stark shifts and Raman-type schemes for bosonic Dysprosium to isolate effective spin-1 systems and to increase the tunability of model parameters.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22216'&gt;arXiv:2410.22216&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 29 Oct 2024 16:48:01 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Zero-point energy of tensor fluctuations on the MPS manifold</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22411</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Sebastian Leontica, Andrew G. Green&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; This work presents a method for studying low-energy physics in highly correlated magnetic systems using the matrix product state (MPS) manifold. We adapt the spin-wave approach, which has been very successful in modeling certain low-entanglement magnetic materials, to systems where the ground state is better represented by an MPS, such as the S = 1 Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki (AKLT) model. We argue that the quasi-local action of tensor fluctuations and the natural Kähler structure of the MPS manifold facilitate a description in terms of bosonic modes. We apply this approach to compute fluctuation corrections to the bilinear-biquadratic Heisenberg model, whose ground state we expect to be close to the exact bond dimension 2 AKLT state in a certain parameter range. Our results show significant improvements in energy approximations, highlighting both the qualitative and quantitative potential of this paradigm for studying complex entangled systems. This approach paves the way for new insights into the low-energy physics of correlated materials and the development of effective field theories beyond traditional semiclassical methods.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22411'&gt;arXiv:2410.22411&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 29 Oct 2024 18:00:02 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Statistical mechanical mapping and maximum-likelihood thresholds for the surface code under generic single-qubit coherent errors</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22436</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Jan Behrends, Benjamin Béri&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The surface code, one of the leading candidates for quantum error correction, is known to protect encoded quantum information against stochastic, i.e., incoherent errors. The protection against coherent errors, such as from unwanted gate rotations, is however understood only for special cases, such as rotations about the $X$ or $Z$ axes. Here we consider generic single-qubit coherent errors in the surface code, i.e., rotations by angle $\alpha$ about an axis that can be chosen arbitrarily. We develop a statistical mechanical mapping for such errors and perform entanglement analysis in transfer matrix space to numerically establish the existence of an error-correcting phase, which we chart in a subspace of rotation axes to estimate the corresponding maximum-likelihood thresholds $\alpha_\text{th}$. The classical statistical mechanics model we derive is a random-bond Ising model with complex couplings and four-spin interactions (i.e., a complex-coupled Ashkin-Teller model). The error correcting phase, $\alpha&lt;\alpha_\text{th}$, where the logical error rate decreases exponentially with code distance, is shown to correspond in transfer matrix space to a gapped one-dimensional quantum Hamiltonian exhibiting spontaneous breaking of a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry. Our numerical results rest on two key ingredients: (i) we show that the state evolution under the transfer matrix -- a non-unitary (1+1)-dimensional quantum circuit -- can be efficiently numerically simulated using matrix product states. Based on this approach, (ii) we also develop an algorithm to (approximately) sample syndromes based on their Born probability. The $\alpha_\text{th}$ values we find show that the maximum likelihood thresholds for coherent errors are larger than those for the corresponding incoherent errors (from the Pauli twirl), and significantly exceed the values found using minimum weight perfect matching.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22436'&gt;arXiv:2410.22436&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 29 Oct 2024 18:23:23 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Exact renormalization group flow for matrix product density operators</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Kohtaro Kato&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Matrix product density operator (MPDO) provides an efficient tensor network representation of mixed states on one-dimensional quantum many-body systems. We study a real-space renormalization group transformation of MPDOs represented by a circuit of local quantum channels. We require that the renormalization group flow is exact, in the sense that it exactly preserves the correlation between the coarse-grained sites and is therefore invertible by another circuit of local quantum channels. Unlike matrix product states (MPS), which always have a well-defined isometric renormalization transformation, we show that general MPDOs do not necessarily admit a converging exact renormalization group flow. We then introduce a subclass of MPDOs with a well-defined renormalization group flow, and show the structure of the MPDOs in the subclass as a representation of a pre-bialgebra structure. As a result, such MPDOs obey generalized symmetry represented by matrix product operator algebras associated with the pre-bialgebra. We also discuss implications with the classification of mixed-state quantum phases.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22696'&gt;arXiv:2410.22696&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 30 Oct 2024 05:09:51 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Performance Benchmarking of Quantum Algorithms for Hard Combinatorial Optimization Problems: A Comparative Study of non-FTQC Approaches</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22810</link>

Our benchmark includes noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) algorithms, such as the variational quantum eigensolver, quantum approximate optimization algorithm, quantum imaginary time evolution, and imaginary time quantum annealing, with both ansatz-based and ansatz-free implementations, alongside tensor network methods and direct simulations of the imaginary-time Schrödinger equation. For comparative analysis, we also utilize classical simulated annealing and quantum annealing on D-Wave devices. Employing default configurations, our findings reveal that no single non-FTQC algorithm performs optimally across all problem types, underscoring the need for tailored algorithmic strategies. This work provides an objective performance baseline and serves as a critical reference point for advancing NISQ algorithms and quantum annealing platforms.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22810'&gt;arXiv:2410.22810&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 30 Oct 2024 08:41:29 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>LEGO_HQEC: A Software Tool for Analyzing Holographic Quantum Codes</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22861</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Junyu Fan, Matthew Steinberg, Alexander Jahn, Chunjun Cao, Aritra Sarkar, Sebastian Feld&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Quantum error correction (QEC) is a crucial prerequisite for future large-scale quantum computation. Finding and analyzing new QEC codes, along with efficient decoding and fault-tolerance protocols, is central to this effort. Holographic codes are a recent class of QEC subsystem codes derived from holographic bulk/boundary dualities. In addition to exploring the physics of such dualities, these codes possess useful QEC properties such as tunable encoding rates, distance scaling competitive with topological codes, and excellent recovery thresholds. To allow for a comprehensive analysis of holographic code constructions, we introduce LEGO_HQEC, a software package utilizing the quantum LEGO formalism. This package constructs holographic codes on regular hyperbolic tilings and generates their stabilizer generators and logical operators for a specified number of seed codes and layers. Three decoders are included: an erasure decoder based on Gaussian elimination; an integer-optimization decoder; and a tensor-network decoder. With these tools, LEGO_HQEC thus enables future systematic studies regarding the utility of holographic codes for practical quantum computing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22861'&gt;arXiv:2410.22861&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 30 Oct 2024 09:54:11 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Two-particle calculations with quantics tensor trains: Solving the parquet equations</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22975</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Stefan Rohshap, Marc K. Ritter, Hiroshi Shinaoka, Jan von Delft, Markus Wallerberger, Anna Kauch&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We present the first application of quantics tensor trains (QTTs) and tensor cross interpolation (TCI) to the solution of a full set of self-consistent equations for multivariate functions, the so-called parquet equations. We show that the steps needed to evaluate the equations (Bethe--Salpeter equations, parquet equation and Schwinger--Dyson equation) can be decomposed into basic operations on the QTT-TCI (QTCI) compressed objects. The repeated application of these operations does not lead to a loss of accuracy beyond a specified tolerance and the iterative scheme converges even for numerically demanding parameters. As examples we take the Hubbard model in the atomic limit and the single impurity Anderson model, where the basic objects in parquet equations, the two-particle vertices, depend on three frequencies, but not on momenta. The results show that this approach is able to overcome major computational bottlenecks of standard numerical methods. The applied methods allow for an exponential increase of the number of grid points included in the calculations leading to an exponentially improving computational error for a linear increase in computational cost.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22975'&gt;arXiv:2410.22975&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 30 Oct 2024 12:42:17 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

Although the method is general we specialize to the $SO(6)$ spin chain for which integrable matrix product states corresponding to evaluation representations of the twisted Yangian $Y^+(4)$ encode the information about one-point functions of the D3-D5 domain wall version of ${\cal N}=4$ SYM. Considering the untwisted and homogeneous limit of our summation formulas we finally fill the last gap in the analytical understanding of the overlap formula for the $SO(6$) sector of the D3-D5 domain wall system.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23117'&gt;arXiv:2410.23117&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 30 Oct 2024 15:27:43 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>When can classical neural networks represent quantum states?</title>

Past works have demonstrated that classical neural networks can succinctly express these amplitudes for many physically relevant states, leading to computationally powerful representations known as neural quantum states. What underpins the efficacy of such representations? We show that conditional correlations present in the measurement distribution of quantum states control the performance of their neural representations. Such conditional correlations are basis dependent, arise due to measurement-induced entanglement, and reveal features not accessible through conventional few-body correlations often examined in studies of phases of matter. By combining theoretical and numerical analysis, we demonstrate how the state's entanglement and sign structure, along with the choice of measurement basis, give rise to distinct patterns of short- or long-range conditional correlations. Our findings provide a rigorous framework for exploring the expressive power of neural quantum states.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23152'&gt;arXiv:2410.23152&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 30 Oct 2024 16:06:53 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Phase Diagram of Kane-Mele Hubbard model at small doping</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Gaurav Kumar Gupta, D. N. Sheng, C. S. Ting&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Recent experiment on MoTe$_2$-WTe$_2$ twisted bi-layer demonstrated physics of Kane-Mele (KM) as well as Haldane models. Although topological properties of KM model has been studied extensively, effects of interaction are still less explored beyond half filling. In this work we study the effect of Hubbard interaction in KM model at small hole doping around half filling. We use density matrix renormalization group method to characterize different phase of cylinders with width of $L_y=3$ unit cells. We identify {a possible} superconducting (SC) phase and transition at different strength of spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and show the strong dependence of critical interaction for SC transition. We also calculate the single-particle Green's function, spin-spin and density-density correlations and compare with SC correlation to establish the dominance of SC correlations. Our result highlights striking behaviour of SC transition and its dependence on SOC which could be useful in understanding different ways to achieve unconventional SC.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23221'&gt;arXiv:2410.23221&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 30 Oct 2024 17:11:53 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Measurement-induced entanglement and complexity in random constant-depth 2D quantum circuits</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23248</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Max McGinley, Wen Wei Ho, Daniel Malz&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We analyse the entanglement structure of states generated by random constant-depth two-dimensional quantum circuits, followed by projective measurements of a subset of sites. By deriving a rigorous lower bound on the average entanglement entropy of such post-measurement states, we prove that macroscopic long-ranged entanglement is generated above some constant critical depth in several natural classes of circuit architectures, which include brickwork circuits and random holographic tensor networks. This behaviour had been conjectured based on previous works, which utilize non-rigorous methods such as replica theory calculations, or work in regimes where the local Hilbert space dimension grows with system size. To establish our lower bound, we develop new replica-free theoretical techniques that leverage tools from multi-user quantum information theory, which are of independent interest, allowing us to map the problem onto a statistical mechanics model of self-avoiding walks without requiring large local Hilbert space dimension. Our findings have consequences for the complexity of classically simulating sampling from random shallow circuits, and of contracting tensor networks: First, we show that standard algorithms based on matrix product states which are used for both these tasks will fail above some constant depth and bond dimension, respectively. In addition, we also prove that these random constant-depth quantum circuits cannot be simulated by any classical circuit of sublogarithmic depth.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23248'&gt;arXiv:2410.23248&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 30 Oct 2024 17:33:02 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Exact overlaps for "all" integrable matrix product states of rational spin chains</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Tamas Gombor&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The overlaps between integrable matrix product states (MPS) and Bethe states are important in both the non-equilibrium statistical physics and the AdS/CFT duality. We present the general MPS overlap formula. The result is a product of a ratio of Gaudin determinants and a prefactor. The Gaudin determinants depend on the spin chain but not on the MPS. The MPS dependent prefactor is given for all integrable MPS of the $\mathfrak{gl}_{N}$, $\mathfrak{o}_{N}$ and $\mathfrak{sp}_{N}$ symmetric spin chains with arbitrary representations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23282'&gt;arXiv:2410.23282&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 30 Oct 2024 17:58:23 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Entanglement scaling and criticality of infinite-size quantum many-body systems in continuous space addressed by a tensor network approach</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23624</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Rui Hong, Hao-Wei Cui, An-Chun Ji, Shi-Ju Ran&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Simulating strongly-correlated quantum systems in continuous space belongs to the most challenging and long-concerned issues in quantum physics. This work investigates the quantum entanglement and criticality of the ground-state wave-functions of infinitely-many coupled quantum oscillators (iCQOs). The essential task involves solving a set of partial differential equations (Schrödinger equations in the canonical quantization picture) with infinitely-many variables, which currently lacks valid methods. By extending the imaginary-time evolution algorithm with translationally-invariant functional tensor network, we simulate the ground state of iCQOs with the presence of two- and three-body couplings. We determine the range of coupling strengths where there exists a real ground-state energy (dubbed as physical region). With two-body couplings, we reveal the logarithmic scaling law of entanglement entropy (EE) and the polynomial scaling law of correlation length against the virtual bond dimension $\chi$ at the dividing point of physical and non-physical regions. These two scaling behaviors are signatures of criticality, according to the previous results in quantum lattice models, but were not reported in continuous-space quantum systems. The scaling coefficients result in a central charge $c=1$, indicating the presence of free boson conformal field theory (CFT). We further show that the presence of three-body couplings, for which there are no analytical or numerical results, breaks down the CFT description at the dividing point. Our work reveals the scaling behaviors of EE in continuous-space quantum many-body systems. These results provide strong numerical evidence supporting the efficiency of TN in representing continuous-space quantum wave-functions in the thermodynamic limit and offer an efficient approach to studying entanglement properties and criticality in continuous space.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23624'&gt;arXiv:2410.23624&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 31 Oct 2024 04:20:49 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Neural Network Matrix Product Operator: A Multi-Dimensionally Integrable Machine Learning Potential</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23858</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Kentaro Hino, Yuki Kurashige&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; A neural network-based machine learning potential energy surface (PES) expressed in a matrix product operator (NN-MPO) is proposed. The MPO form enables efficient evaluation of high-dimensional integrals that arise in solving the time-dependent and time-independent Schrödinger equation and effectively overcomes the so-called curse of dimensionality. This starkly contrasts with other neural network-based machine learning PES methods, such as multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs), where evaluating high-dimensional integrals is not straightforward due to the fully connected topology in their backbone architecture. Nevertheless, the NN-MPO retains the high representational capacity of neural networks. NN-MPO can achieve spectroscopic accuracy with a test mean absolute error (MAE) of 3.03 cm$^{-1}$ for a fully coupled six-dimensional ab initio PES, using only 625 training points distributed across a 0 to 17,000 cm$^{-1}$ energy range.

      <title>Time evolving matrix product operator (TEMPO) method in a non-diagonal basis set based on derivative of the path integral expression</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23877</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Shuocang Zhang, Qiang Shi&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The time-evolving matrix product operator (TEMPO) method is a powerful tool for simulating open system quantum dynamics. Typically, it is used in problems with diagonal system-bath coupling, where analytical expressions for discretized influence functional are available. In this work, we aim to address issues related to off-diagonal coupling by extending the TEMPO algorithm to accommodate arbitrary basis sets. The proposed approach is based on computing the derivative of the discretized path integral expression of a generalized influence functional when increasing one time step, which yields an equation of motion valid for non-diagonal basis set and arbitrary number of non-commuting baths. The generalized influence functional is then obtained by integrating the resulting differential equation. Applicability of the the new method is then tested by simulating one- and two- qubit systems coupled to both Z- and X-type baths.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23877'&gt;arXiv:2410.23877&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 31 Oct 2024 12:38:30 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Pair Approximating the Action For Molecular Rotations in Path Integral Monte Carlo</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00310</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Shaeer Moeed, Tobias Serwatka, Pierre-Nicholas Roy&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Typical path integral Monte Carlo approaches use the primitive approximation to compute the probability density for a given path. In this work, we develop the pair Discrete Variable Representation (pair-DVR) approach to study molecular rotations. The pair propagator, which was initially introduced to study superfluidity in condensed Helium, is naturally well-suited for systems interacting with a pair-wise potential. Consequently, paths sampled using the pair action tend to be closer to the exact paths (compared to primitive Trotter paths) for such systems leading to convergence with less imaginary time steps. Therefore, our approach relies on using the pair factorization approach in conjunction with a discretized Path Integral Ground State (PIGS) paradigm to study a chain of planar rotors interacting with a pair-wise dipole interaction. We first use the Wigner-Kirkwood density expansion to analyze the asymptotics of the pair propagator in imaginary time. Then, we exhibit the utility of the pair factorization scheme via convergence studies comparing the pair and primitive propagators. Finally, we compute energetic and structural properties of this system including the correlation function and Binder ratio as functions of the coupling strength to examine the behaviour of the pair-DVR method near criticality. Density Matrix Renormalization Group results are used for benchmarking throughout.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00310'&gt;arXiv:2411.00310&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 01 Nov 2024 02:06:49 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Optical absorption activated by an ultrashort half-cycle pulse in metallic and superconducting states of the Hubbard model</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00313</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Kazuya Shinjo, Shigetoshi Sota, Seiji Yunoki, Takami Tohyama&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The development of high-intensity ultrashort laser pulses unlocks the potential of pump-probe spectroscopy in sub-femtosecond timescale. Notably, subcycle pump pulses can generate electronic states unreachable by conventional multicycle pulses, leading to a phenomenon that we refer to as subcycle-pulse engineering. In this study, we employ the time-dependent density-matrix renormalization group method to unveil the transient absorption spectra of superconducting and metallic states in nearly half-filled one-dimensional and two-dimensional Hubbard models excited by an ultrashort half-cycle pulse, which can induce a current with inversion-symmetry breaking. In a superconducting state realized in attractive on-site interactions, we find the transient activation of absorptions at energies corresponding to the amplitude modes of superconducting and charge-density-wave states. On the other hand, in a metallic state realized in the two-dimensional model with repulsive on-site interactions, we obtain another type of absorption enhancements, which are distributed broadly in spin excitation energies. These findings indicate that superconducting and metallic states are sensitive to an ultrashort half-cycle pulse, leading to the transient activations of optical absorptions with their respective mechanisms.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00313'&gt;arXiv:2411.00313&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 01 Nov 2024 02:10:16 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Fusing matrix-product states with quantum Monte Carlo: reducing entanglement and sign problem at the same time</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00480</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Gunnar Bollmark, Sam Mardazad, Johannes S. Hofmann, Adrian Kantian&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Systems of correlated quantum matter can be a steep challenge to any would-be method of solution. Matrix-product state (MPS)-based methods can describe 1D systems quasiexactly, but often struggle to retain sufficient bipartite entanglement to accurately approximate 2D systems already. Conversely, Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) approaches, based on sampling a probability distribution, can generally approximate 2D and 3D systems with an error that decays systematically with growing sampling size. However, QMC can suffer from the so-called sign problem, that makes the approach prohibitively costly for many systems of interest, such as repulsively interacting fermions away from commensurate densities and frustrated systems. In this article, we introduce a new hybrid approach, that combines auxiliary-field QMC (AFQMC) with MPS-based algorithms. This hybrid technique removes or reduces the sign problem (depending on the specific model) while also needing to retain much lower bipartite entanglement than brute-force application of a MPS-algorithm, without the use of uncontrolled approximations. We present two use-cases of the algorithm that would be challenging or impossible to address with any other approach, and quantify the extent of any remaining sign problem.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00480'&gt;arXiv:2411.00480&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 01 Nov 2024 09:51:53 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Non-Markovian effects in long-range polariton-mediated energy transfer</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00503</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Kristin B. Arnardottir, Piper Fowler-Wright, Christos Tserkezis, Brendon W. Lovett, Jonathan Keeling&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Intramolecular energy transfer driven by near-field effects plays an important role in applications ranging from biophysics and chemistry to nano-optics and quantum communications. Advances in strong light-matter coupling in molecular systems have opened new possibilities to control energy transfer. In particular, long-distance energy transfer between molecules has been reported as the result of their mutual coupling to cavity photon modes, and the formation of hybrid polariton states. In addition to strong coupling to light, molecular systems also show strong interactions between electronic and vibrational modes. The latter can act as a reservoir for energy to facilitate off-resonant transitions, and thus energy relaxation between polaritonic states at different energies. However, the non-Markovian nature of those modes makes it challenging to accurately simulate these effects. Here we capture them via process tensor matrix product operator (PT-MPO) methods, to describe exactly the vibrational environment of the molecules combined with a mean-field treatment of the light-matter interaction. In particular, we study the emission dynamics of a system consisting of two spatially separated layers of different species of molecules coupled to a common photon mode, and show that the strength of coupling to the vibrational bath plays a crucial role in governing the dynamics of the energy of the emitted light; at strong vibrational coupling this dynamics shows strongly non-Markovian effects, eventually leading to polaron formation. Our results shed light on polaritonic long-range energy transfer, and provide further understanding of the role of vibrational modes of relevance to the growing field of molecular polaritonics.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00503'&gt;arXiv:2411.00503&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 01 Nov 2024 10:38:27 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Nonperturbative decay of bipartite discrete time crystals</title>

Using a tensor network ansatz for the state which reflects the geometry of a unit cell of the lattice, we show through finite entanglement scaling that the system has an exponentially long-lived subharmonic response in the thermodynamic limit, which decays nonperturbatively in deviations from a perfect periodic drive. The resulting prethermal discrete time crystal is not only stable to imperfections in the transverse field, but also exhibits a bipartite rigidity to generic perturbations in the longitudinal field. We call this state a bipartite discrete time crystal and reveal a rich prethermal phase diagram, including multiple regions of bipartite time-crystalline order, uniform time-crystalline order and thermalization, with boundaries depending delicately on the topology of the decorated lattice. Our results thus uncover a variety of time crystals which may be realized on current digital quantum processors and analog quantum simulators.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00651'&gt;arXiv:2411.00651&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 01 Nov 2024 15:13:43 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

Filippov&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Quantum circuits with local unitaries have emerged as a rich playground for the exploration of many-body quantum dynamics of discrete-time systems. While the intrinsic locality makes them particularly suited to run on current quantum processors, the task of verification at non-trivial scales is complicated for non-integrable systems. Here, we study a special class of maximally chaotic circuits known as dual unitary circuits -- exhibiting unitarity in both space and time -- that are known to have exact analytical solutions for certain correlation functions. With advances in noise learning and the implementation of novel error mitigation methods, we show that a superconducting quantum processor with 91 qubits is able to accurately simulate these correlators. We then probe dynamics beyond exact verification, by perturbing the circuits away from the dual unitary point, and compare our results to classical approximations with tensor networks. These results cement error-mitigated digital quantum simulation on pre-fault-tolerant quantum processors as a trustworthy platform for the exploration and discovery of novel emergent quantum many-body phases.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00765'&gt;arXiv:2411.00765&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 01 Nov 2024 17:57:13 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Finite Correlation Length Scaling of Disorder Parameter at Quantum Criticality</title>

In a dual picture, disorder parameters actually detect SSB of higher-form symmetries. In this work, we show that the non-local disorder parameters can be conveniently and efficiently evaluated using infinite projected entangled pair states (iPEPS). Moreover, we propose a finite correlation length scaling theory of the disorder parameter within the quantum critical region and validate the scaling theory with variationally optimized iPEPS. We find from the finite correlation length scaling that the disorder parameter satisfies perimeter law at a critical point, i.e., it decays exponentially with the boundary size of the subsystem, indicating spontaneous higher-form symmetry breaking at the critical point of the dual model.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01009'&gt;arXiv:2411.01009&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 01 Nov 2024 20:19:57 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Quantum complexity and generalized area law in fully connected models</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02140</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Donghoon Kim, Tomotaka Kuwahara&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The area law for entanglement entropy fundamentally reflects the complexity of quantum many-body systems, demonstrating ground states of local Hamiltonians to be represented with low computational complexity. While this principle is well-established in one-dimensional systems, little is known beyond 1D cases, and attempts to generalize the area law on infinite-dimensional graphs have largely been disproven. In this work, for non-critical ground states of Hamiltonians on fully connected graphs, we establish a generalized area law up to a polylogarithmic factor in system size, by effectively reducing the boundary area to a constant scale for interactions between subsystems. This result implies an efficient approximation of the ground state by the matrix product state up to an approximation error of $1/\text{poly}(n)$. As the core technique, we develop the mean-field renormalization group approach, which rigorously guarantees efficiency by systematically grouping regions of the system and iteratively approximating each as a product state. This approach provides a rigorous pathway to efficiently simulate ground states of complex systems, advancing our understanding of infinite-dimensional quantum many-body systems and their entanglement structures.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02140'&gt;arXiv:2411.02140&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 04 Nov 2024 14:57:52 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Entanglement area law in interacting bosons: from Bose-Hubbard, $φ$4, and beyond</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02157</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Donghoon Kim, Tomotaka Kuwahara&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The entanglement area law is a universal principle that characterizes the information structure in quantum many-body systems and serves as the foundation for modern algorithms based on tensor network representations. Historically, the area law has been well understood under two critical assumptions: short-range interactions and bounded local energy. However, extending the area law beyond these assumptions has been a long-sought goal in quantum many-body theory. This challenge is especially pronounced in interacting boson systems, where the breakdown of the bounded energy assumption is universal and poses significant difficulties. In this work, we prove the area law for one-dimensional interacting boson systems including the long-range interactions. Our model encompasses the Bose-Hubbard class and the $\phi4$ class, two of the most fundamental models in quantum condensed matter physics, statistical mechanics, and high-energy physics. This result achieves the resolution of the area law that incorporates both the challenges of unbounded local energy and long-range interactions in a unified manner. Additionally, we establish an efficiency-guaranteed approximation of the quantum ground states using Matrix Product States (MPS). These results significantly advance our understanding of quantum complexity by offering new insights into how bosonic parameters and interaction decay rates influence entanglement. Our findings provide crucial theoretical foundations for simulating long-range interacting cold atomic systems, which are central to modern quantum technologies, and pave the way for more efficient simulation techniques in future quantum applications.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02157'&gt;arXiv:2411.02157&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 04 Nov 2024 15:16:44 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Small-scale Hamiltonian optimization of interpolating operators for Lagrangian lattice quantum field theory</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02185</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Artur Avkhadiev, Lena Funcke, Karl Jansen, Stefan Kühn, Phiala E. Shanahan&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Lattice quantum field theory calculations may potentially combine the advantages of Hamiltonian formulations with the scalability and control of conventional Lagrangian frameworks. However, such hybrid approaches need to consider (1) the differences in renormalized coupling values between the two formulations, and (2) finite-volume and discretization effects when the Hamiltonian component of the calculation is characterized by a smaller volume or coarser lattice spacing than the Lagrangian component. This work investigates the role of both factors in the application of Hamiltonian-optimized interpolating operator constructions for the conventional Lagrangian framework. The numerical investigation is realized for the pseudoscalar meson in the Schwinger model, using tensor-network and Monte-Carlo calculations. It is demonstrated that tensor-network-optimized constructions are robust to both (1) and (2). In particular, accurate optimized constructions for the pseudoscalar meson can be obtained from calculations with a smaller number of Hamiltonian lattice sites, even when the meson mass itself receives significant finite-volume corrections. To the extent that these results generalize to theories with more complicated spectra, the method holds promise for near-term applications in large-scale calculations of lattice quantum field theory.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02185'&gt;arXiv:2411.02185&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 04 Nov 2024 15:39:30 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Schmidt Decomposition of Multipartite States</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Mithilesh Kumar&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Quantum states can be written in infinitely many ways depending on the choices of basis. Schmidt decomposition of a quantum state has a lot of properties useful in the study of entanglement. All bipartite states admit Schmidt decomposition, but this does not extend to multipartite systems. We obtain necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of Schmidt decompositions of multipartite states. Moreover, we provide an efficient algorithm to obtain the decomposition for a Schmidt decomposable multipartite state.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02473'&gt;arXiv:2411.02473&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 04 Nov 2024 17:01:28 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Scalable Quantum Simulations of Scattering in Scalar Field Theory on 120 Qubits</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02486</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Nikita A. Zemlevskiy&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Simulations of collisions of fundamental particles on a quantum computer are expected to have an exponential advantage over classical methods and promise to enhance searches for new physics. Furthermore, scattering in scalar field theory has been shown to be BQP-complete, making it a representative problem for which quantum computation is efficient. As a step toward large-scale quantum simulations of collision processes, scattering of wavepackets in one-dimensional scalar field theory is simulated using 120 qubits of IBM's Heron superconducting quantum computer ibm_fez. Variational circuits compressing vacuum preparation, wavepacket initialization, and time evolution are determined using classical resources. By leveraging physical properties of states in the theory, such as symmetries and locality, the variational quantum algorithm constructs scalable circuits that can be used to simulate arbitrarily-large system sizes. A new strategy is introduced to mitigate errors in quantum simulations, which enables the extraction of meaningful results from circuits with up to 4924 two-qubit gates and two-qubit gate depths of 103. The effect of interactions is clearly seen, and is found to be in agreement with classical Matrix Product State simulations. The developments that will be necessary to simulate high-energy inelastic collisions on a quantum computer are discussed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02486'&gt;arXiv:2411.02486&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 04 Nov 2024 19:00:00 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Bethe Ansatz, Quantum Circuits, and the F-basis</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02519</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Roberto Ruiz, Alejandro Sopena, Esperanza López, Germán Sierra, Balázs Pozsgay&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The Bethe Ansatz is a method for constructing exact eigenstates of quantum-integrable spin chains. Recently, deterministic quantum algorithms, referred to as "algebraic Bethe circuits", have been developed to prepare Bethe states for the spin-1/2 XXZ model. These circuits represent a unitary formulation of the standard algebraic Bethe Ansatz, expressed using matrix-product states that act on both the spin chain and an auxiliary space. In this work, we systematize these previous results, and show that algebraic Bethe circuits can be derived by a change of basis in the auxiliary space. The new basis, identical to the "F-basis" known from the theory of quantum-integrable models, generates the linear superposition of plane waves that is characteristic of the coordinate Bethe Ansatz. We explain this connection, highlighting that certain properties of the F-basis (namely, the exchange symmetry of the spins) are crucial for the construction of algebraic Bethe circuits. We demonstrate our approach by presenting new quantum circuits for the inhomogeneous spin-1/2 XXZ model.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02519'&gt;arXiv:2411.02519&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 04 Nov 2024 19:01:41 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Universal Spin Screening Clouds in Local Moment Phases</title>

Sim, Donghoon Kim&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; When a local impurity spin interacts with conduction electrons whose density of states (DOS) has a (pseudo)gap or diverges at the Fermi energy, a local moment (LM) phase can be favored over a Kondo phase. Theoretically studying quantum entanglement between the impurity and conduction electrons, we demonstrate that conduction electrons form an ''LM spin cloud'' in general LM phases, which corresponds to, but has fundamental difference from, the Kondo cloud screening the impurity spin in the Kondo phase. The LM cloud algebraically decays over the distance from the impurity when the DOS has a pseudogap or divergence, and exponentially when it has a hard gap. We find an ''LM cloud length'', a single length scale characterizing a universal form of the LM cloud. The findings are supported by both of analytic theories and numerical computations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02723'&gt;arXiv:2411.02723&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 05 Nov 2024 01:43:43 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>A Linear-complexity Tensor Butterfly Algorithm for Compressing High-dimensional Oscillatory Integral Operators</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03029</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; P. Michael Kielstra, Tianyi Shi, Hengrui Luo, Jianliang Qian, Yang Liu&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; This paper presents a multilevel tensor compression algorithm called tensor butterfly algorithm for efficiently representing large-scale and high-dimensional oscillatory integral operators, including Green's functions for wave equations and integral transforms such as Radon transforms and Fourier transforms. The proposed algorithm leverages a tensor extension of the so-called complementary low-rank property of existing matrix butterfly algorithms. The algorithm partitions the discretized integral operator tensor into subtensors of multiple levels, and factorizes each subtensor at the middle level as a Tucker-type interpolative decomposition, whose factor matrices are formed in a multilevel fashion. For a $d$-dimensional integral operator discretized into a $2d$-mode tensor with $n^{2d}$ entries, the overall CPU time and memory requirement scale as $O(n^d)$, in stark contrast to the $O(n^d\log n)$ requirement of existing matrix algorithms such as matrix butterfly algorithm and fast Fourier transforms (FFT), where $n$ is the number of points per direction. When comparing with other tensor algorithms such as quantized tensor train (QTT), the proposed algorithm also shows superior CPU and memory performance for tensor contraction. Remarkably, the tensor butterfly algorithm can efficiently model high-frequency Green's function interactions between two unit cubes, each spanning 512 wavelengths per direction, which represents over $512\times$ larger problem sizes than existing butterfly algorithms. On the other hand, for a problem representing 64 wavelengths per direction, which is the largest size existing algorithms can handle, our tensor butterfly algorithm exhibits 200x speedups and $30\times$ memory reduction comparing with existing ones. Moreover, the tensor butterfly algorithm also permits $O(n^d)$-complexity FFTs and Radon transforms up to $d=6$ dimensions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03029'&gt;arXiv:2411.03029&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 05 Nov 2024 11:50:26 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Multiple-basis representation of quantum states</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03110</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Adrián Pérez-Salinas, Patrick Emonts, Jordi Tura, Vedran Dunjko&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Classical simulation of quantum physics is a central approach to investigating physical phenomena. Quantum computers enhance computational capabilities beyond those of classical resources, but it remains unclear to what extent existing limited quantum computers can contribute to this enhancement. In this work, we explore a new hybrid, efficient quantum-classical representation of quantum states, the multiple-basis representation. This representation consists of a linear combination of states that are sparse in some given and different bases, specified by quantum circuits. Such representation is particularly appealing when considering depth-limited quantum circuits within reach of current hardware. We analyze the expressivity of multiple-basis representation states depending on the classical simulability of their quantum circuits. In particular, we show that multiple-basis representation states include, but are not restricted to, both matrix-product states and stabilizer states. Furthermore, we find cases in which this representation can be used, namely approximation of ground states, simulation of deeper computations by specifying bases with shallow circuits, and a tomographical protocol to describe states as multiple-basis representations. We envision this work to open the path of simultaneous use of several hardware-friendly bases, a natural description of hybrid computational methods accessible for near-term hardware.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03110'&gt;arXiv:2411.03110&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 05 Nov 2024 13:57:57 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Quantum Error Mitigation via Linear-Depth Verifier Circuits</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03245</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Angus Mingare, Anastasia Moroz, Marcell D Kovacs, Andrew G Green&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Implementing many important sub-circuits on near-term quantum devices remains a challenge due to the high levels of noise and the prohibitive depth on standard nearest-neighbour topologies. Overcoming these barriers will likely require quantum error mitigation (QEM) strategies. This work introduces the notion of efficient, high-fidelity verifier circuit architectures that we propose for use in such a QEM scheme. We provide a method for constructing verifier circuits for any quantum circuit that is accurately represented by a low-dimensional matrix product operator (MPO). We demonstrate our method by constructing explicit verifier circuits for multi-controlled single unitary gates as well as the quantum Fourier transform (QFT). By transpiling the circuits to a 2D array of qubits, we estimate the crossover point where the verifier circuit is shallower than the circuit itself, and hence useful for QEM. We propose a method of in situ QEM using the verifier circuit architecture. We conclude that our approach may be useful for calibrating quantum sub-circuits to counter coherent noise but cannot correct for the incoherent noise present in current devices.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03245'&gt;arXiv:2411.03245&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 05 Nov 2024 16:44:18 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Does connected wedge imply distillable entanglement?</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03426</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Takato Mori, Beni Yoshida&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The Ryu-Takayanagi formula predicts that two boundary subsystems $A$ and $C$ can exhibit large mutual information $I(A:C)$ even when they are spatially disconnected on the boundary and separated by a buffer subsystem $B$, as long as $A$ and $C$ have connected entanglement wedge in the bulk. However, whether the reduced state $\rho_{AC}$ contains distillable EPR pairs has remained a longstanding open problem. In this work, we resolve this problem by showing that: i) there is no LO-distillable entanglement at leading order in $G_N$, suggesting the absence of bipartite entanglement in a holographic mixed state $\rho_{AC}$, and ii) one-shot, one-way LOCC-distillable entanglement is given at leading order by locally accessible information $J^W(A|C)$, which is related to the entanglement wedge cross section $E^W$ involving the (third) purifying system $B$ via $J^W(A|C) = S_A - E^W(A:B)$. Namely, we demonstrate that a connected entanglement wedge does not necessarily imply nonzero distillable entanglement in one-shot, one-way LOCC. We also show that entanglement of formation $E_{F}(A:C)$ is given by $E^W(A:C)$ at leading order in holography.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03426'&gt;arXiv:2411.03426&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 05 Nov 2024 19:00:00 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Gauge-Fixing Quantum Density Operators At Scale</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03548</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Amit Jamadagni, Eugene Dumitrescu&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We provide theory, algorithms, and simulations of non-equilibrium quantum systems using a one-dimensional (1D) completely-positive (CP), matrix-product (MP) density-operator ($\rho$) representation. By generalizing the matrix product state's orthogonality center, to additionally store positive classical mixture correlations, the MP$\rho$ factorization naturally emerges. In this work we analytically and numerically examine the virtual freedoms associated with the representation of quantum density operators. Using this augmented perspective, we simplify algorithms in certain limits to integrate the canonical form's master equation dynamics. This enables us to quickly evolve under the dynamics of two-body quantum channels without resorting to optimization-based methods. In addition to this technical advance, we also scale-up numerical examples and discuss implications for accurately modeling hardware architectures and predicting their performance. This includes an example of the quantum to classical transition of informationally leaky, i.e., decohering, qubits. In this setting, due to loss from environmental interactions, non-local complex coherence correlations are converted into global incoherent classical statistical mixture correlations. Lastly, the representation of both global and local correlations is discussed. We expect this work to have applications in additional non-equilibrium settings, beyond qubit engineering.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03548'&gt;arXiv:2411.03548&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 05 Nov 2024 22:56:13 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>First order Quantum Hall to Wigner crystal phase transition on a triangular lattice: an iDMRG study</title>

We neglect spin and fix a density of one third, with one unit of magnetic flux per particle. The infinite density matrix renormalization group algorithm is used to compute the ground state of this generalized Fermi-Hubbard model. Increasing the strength of the nearest-neighbor repulsion, we find a first order transition between an Integer Quantum Hall phase and a crystalline, generalized Wigner crystal state. The first-order nature of the phase transition is consistent with a Ginzburg-Landau argument. We expect our results to be relevant for moiré heterostructures of two-dimensional materials.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03748'&gt;arXiv:2411.03748&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 06 Nov 2024 08:24:32 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

Herbrych&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Valence bond (VB) states as the formation mechanism of Cooper pairs, eventually leading to high-temperature superconductivity, remain a controversial topic. Although various VB-like states find variational relevance in the description of specific spin models and quantum spin liquids, in the realm of many-body fermionic Hamiltonians, the evidence for such states as ground states wave functions remains elusive, challenging the valence-bond pairing mechanism. Here, we present evidence of a VB ground state with pairing tendencies, particularly at finite doping. We achieved this for the generic two-orbital Hubbard model in low dimension, where the VB states can be associated with the presence of the topological order manifested by edge states.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03771'&gt;arXiv:2411.03771&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 06 Nov 2024 09:07:31 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

The renormalized electronic structure and Fermi surface of correlated La$_{0.8}$Sr$_{0.2}$NiO$_2$ are studied in an effective two-band model through the dynamical mean-field calculation. We find the correlation effects reflect mainly on the Ni $d$ band, which is consistent with the experimental findings. We further study the ground state including magnetism and superconductivity through the density matrix embedding theory. Within the experimental doping range and rigid-band approximation, we show that the $d$-wave superconductivity is the lowest energy state, while the static magnetism is absent except very close to zero doping. These findings provide a new understanding of infinite-layer nickelate superconductivity.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03777'&gt;arXiv:2411.03777&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 06 Nov 2024 09:14:34 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Self-congruent point in critical matrix product states: An effective field theory for finite-entanglement scaling</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03954</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Jan T. Schneider, Atsushi Ueda, Yifan Liu, Andreas M. Läuchli, Masaki Oshikawa, Luca Tagliacozzo&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We set up an effective field theory formulation for the renormalization flow of matrix product states (MPS) with finite bond dimension, focusing on systems exhibiting finite-entanglement scaling close to a conformally invariant critical fixed point. We show that the finite MPS bond dimension $\chi$ is equivalent to introducing a perturbation by a relevant operator to the fixed-point Hamiltonian. The fingerprint of this mechanism is encoded in the $\chi$-independent universal transfer matrix's gap ratios, which are distinct from those predicted by the unperturbed Conformal Field Theory. This phenomenon defines a renormalization group self-congruent point, where the relevant coupling constant ceases to flow due to a balance of two effects; When increasing $\chi$, the infrared scale, set by the correlation length $\xi(\chi)$, increases, while the strength of the perturbation at the lattice scale decreases. The presence of a self-congruent point does not alter the validity of the finite-entanglement scaling hypothesis, since the self-congruent point is located at a finite distance from the critical fixed point, well inside the scaling regime of the CFT. We corroborate this framework with numerical evidences from the exact solution of the Ising model and density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations of an effective lattice model.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03954'&gt;arXiv:2411.03954&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 06 Nov 2024 14:35:09 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

To alleviate the curse of dimensionality we use tensor product approximations. To handle the non-smoothness of the objective function we employ a smoothed version of the shared sparsity objective. We consider both a benchmark elliptic PDE constraint, and a more realistic topology optimization problem in engineering. We demonstrate that the error converges linearly in iterations and the smoothing parameter, and faster than algebraically in the number of degrees of freedom, consisting of the number of quadrature points in one variable and tensor ranks. Moreover, in the topology optimization problem, the smoothed shared sparsity penalty actually reduces the tensor ranks compared to the unpenalised solution. This enables us to find a sparse high-resolution design under a high-dimensional uncertainty.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03989'&gt;arXiv:2411.03989&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 06 Nov 2024 15:29:35 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

This method utilizes a mixed formulation of Tensor Train (TT) and Quantized Tensor Train (QTT), designed for the spectral element discretization (Q1-SEM) of the time-dependent convection-diffusion-reaction (CDR) equation. We reformulate the assembly process of the spectral element discretized CDR to enhance its compatibility with tensor operations and introduce a low-rank tensor structure for the spectral element operators. Recognizing the banded structure inherent in the spectral element framework's discrete operators, we further exploit the QTT format of the CDR to achieve greater speed and compression. Additionally, we present a comprehensive approach for integrating variable coefficients of CDR into the global discrete operators within the TT/QTT framework. The effectiveness of the proposed method, in terms of memory efficiency and computational complexity, is demonstrated through a series of numerical experiments, including a semi-linear example.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04026'&gt;arXiv:2411.04026&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 06 Nov 2024 16:20:47 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

By introducing an enhanced compatibility condition, we enable the extension of finite MPS to an infinite-volume state, providing new insights into complex, high-dimensional quantum systems. As an illustrative example, we apply this method to the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state. This approach offers significant potential for advancing theoretical frameworks and practical methodologies in the field of quantum information.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04149'&gt;arXiv:2411.04149&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 05 Nov 2024 21:05:03 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Exploring the quantum capacity of a Gaussian random displacement channel using Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill codes and maximum likelihood decoding</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04277</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Mao Lin, Kyungjoo Noh&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Determining the quantum capacity of a noisy quantum channel is an important problem in the field of quantum communication theory. In this work, we consider the Gaussian random displacement channel $N_{\sigma}$, a type of bosonic Gaussian channels relevant in various bosonic quantum information processing systems. In particular, we attempt to make progress on the problem of determining the quantum capacity of a Gaussian random displacement channel by analyzing the error-correction performance of several families of multi-mode Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) codes. In doing so we analyze the surface-square GKP codes using an efficient and exact maximum likelihood decoder (MLD) up to a large code distance of $d=39$. We find that the error threshold of the surface-square GKP code is remarkably close to $\sigma=1/\sqrt{e}\simeq 0.6065$ at which the best-known lower bound of the quantum capacity of $N_{\sigma}$ vanishes. We also analyze the performance of color-hexagonal GKP codes up to a code distance of $d=13$ using a tensor-network decoder serving as an approximate MLD. By focusing on multi-mode GKP codes that encode just one logical qubit over multiple bosonic modes, we show that GKP codes can achieve non-zero quantum state transmission rates for a Gaussian random displacement channel $N_{\sigma}$ at larger values of $\sigma$ than previously demonstrated. Thus our work reduces the gap between the quantum communication theoretic bounds and the performance of explicit bosonic quantum error-correcting codes in regards to the quantum capacity of a Gaussian random displacement channel.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04277'&gt;arXiv:2411.04277&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 06 Nov 2024 21:47:20 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Learning the closest product state</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Ainesh Bakshi, John Bostanci, William Kretschmer, Zeph Landau, Jerry Li, Allen Liu, Ryan O'Donnell, Ewin Tang&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We study the problem of finding a (pure) product state with optimal fidelity to an unknown $n$-qubit quantum state $\rho$, given copies of $\rho$. This is a basic instance of a fundamental question in quantum learning: is it possible to efficiently learn a simple approximation to an arbitrary state? We give an algorithm which finds a product state with fidelity $\varepsilon$-close to optimal, using $N = n^{\text{poly}(1/\varepsilon)}$ copies of $\rho$ and $\text{poly}(N)$ classical overhead. We further show that estimating the optimal fidelity is NP-hard for error $\varepsilon = 1/\text{poly}(n)$, showing that the error dependence cannot be significantly improved. For our algorithm, we build a carefully-defined cover over candidate product states, qubit by qubit, and then demonstrate that extending the cover can be reduced to approximate constrained polynomial optimization. For our proof of hardness, we give a formal reduction from polynomial optimization to finding the closest product state. Together, these results demonstrate a fundamental connection between these two seemingly unrelated questions. Building on our general approach, we also develop more efficient algorithms in three simpler settings: when the optimal fidelity exceeds $5/6$; when we restrict ourselves to a discrete class of product states; and when we are allowed to output a matrix product state.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04283'&gt;arXiv:2411.04283&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 06 Nov 2024 22:08:08 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

We discuss: (1) tests confirming the Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis; (2) the entanglement entropy of sublattices, including the Page curve, the transition from area to volume scaling with increasing energy of the eigenstate and its time evolution that shows thermalization of localized regions to be a two-step process; (3) the absence of quantum many-body scars when higher gauge field representations are taken into account; (4) the spectral form factor, which exhibits the expected slope-ramp-plateau structure for late times; (5) the entanglement Hamiltonian for SU(2), which has properties in accordance with the Bisognano-Wichmann theorem; and (6) a measure for non-stabilizerness or ``magic'' that is found to reach its maximum during thermalization. We conclude that the thermalization of nonabelian gauge theories is a promising process to establish quantum advantage.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04550'&gt;arXiv:2411.04550&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 07 Nov 2024 09:18:37 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Complexity theory of orbit closure intersection for tensors: reductions, completeness, and graph isomorphism hardness</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04639</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Vladimir Lysikov, Michael Walter&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Many natural computational problems in computer science, mathematics, physics, and other sciences amount to deciding if two objects are equivalent. Often this equivalence is defined in terms of group actions. A natural question is to ask when two objects can be distinguished by polynomial functions that are invariant under the group action. For finite groups, this is the usual notion of equivalence, but for continuous groups like the general linear groups it gives rise to a new notion, called orbit closure intersection. It captures, among others, the graph isomorphism problem, noncommutative PIT, null cone problems in invariant theory, equivalence problems for tensor networks, and the classification of multiparty quantum states. Despite recent algorithmic progress in celebrated special cases, the computational complexity of general orbit closure intersection problems is currently quite unclear. In particular, tensors seem to give rise to the most difficult problems. In this work we start a systematic study of orbit closure intersection from the complexity-theoretic viewpoint. To this end, we define a complexity class TOCI that captures the power of orbit closure intersection problems for general tensor actions, give an appropriate notion of algebraic reductions that imply polynomial-time reductions in the usual sense, but are amenable to invariant-theoretic techniques, identify natural tensor problems that are complete for TOCI, including the equivalence of 2D tensor networks with constant physical dimension, and show that the graph isomorphism problem can be reduced to these complete problems, hence GI$\subseteq$TOCI. As such, our work establishes the first lower bound on the computational complexity of orbit closure intersection problems, and it explains the difficulty of finding unconditional polynomial-time algorithms beyond special cases, as has been observed in the literature.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04639'&gt;arXiv:2411.04639&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 07 Nov 2024 11:52:18 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Pedro Hack, Christian B. Mendl, Alexandru Paler&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; There is an increasing interest in scaling tensor network methods through belief propagation (BP), as well as increasing the accuracy of BP through tensor network methods. We develop a unification framework that takes an arbitrary graphical model with loops and provides message passing update rules and inference equations. We show that recent state-of-the-art methods regarding tensors and BP, like block belief propagation and tensor network message passing, are special instances of our framework. From a practical perspective, we discuss how our framework can be useful in order to understand the benefits of scheduling in BP, and show how it can be used for decoding purposes in quantum error correction. Lastly, to numerically support our claims, we show that our framework can achieve an accuracy improvement of more than ten orders of magnitude over tensor network BP when computing the trace of a tensor network consisting of a chain of connected triangles with periodic boundary conditions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04957'&gt;arXiv:2411.04957&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 07 Nov 2024 18:32:42 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Long-range entanglement from spontaneous non-onsite symmetry breaking</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05004</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Zhehao Zhang, Yabo Li, Tsung-Cheng Lu&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We explore the states of matter arising from the spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) of $\mathbb{Z}_2$ non-onsite symmetries. In one spatial dimension, we construct a frustration-free lattice model exhibiting SSB of a non-onsite symmetry, which features the coexistence of two ground states with distinct symmetry-protected topological (SPT) orders. We analytically prove the two-fold ground-state degeneracy and the existence of a finite energy gap. Fixing the symmetry sector yields a long-range entangled ground state that features long-range correlations among non-invertible charged operators. We also present a constant-depth measurement-feedback protocol to prepare such a state with a constant success probability in the thermodynamic limit, which may be of independent interest. Under a symmetric deformation, the SSB persists up to a critical point, beyond which a gapless phase characterized by a conformal field theory emerges. In two spatial dimensions, the SSB of 1-form non-onsite symmetries leads to a long-range entangled state (SPT soup) - a condensate of 1d SPT along any closed loops. On a torus, there are four such locally indistinguishable states that exhibit algebraic correlations between local operators, which we derived via a mapping to the critical $O(2)$ loop model. This provides an intriguing example of `topological quantum criticality'. Our work reveals the exotic features of SSB of non-onsite symmetries, which may lie beyond the framework of topological holography (SymTFT).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05004'&gt;arXiv:2411.05004&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 07 Nov 2024 18:59:51 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

We use Higher- Order TRG (HOTRG) to generate a coarse-grained time evolution operator for a 1+1D Transverse Ising Model with a longitudinal field. We show that it is effective and efficient in evolving Gaussian wave packets for one and two particles in the disordered phase. Near criticality behavior is more challenging in real-time. We compare our algorithm with local simulators for universal quantum computers and discuss possible benchmarking in the near future.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05301'&gt;arXiv:2411.05301&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 08 Nov 2024 03:05:26 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Numerical investigation of quantum phases and phase transitions in a two-leg ladder of Rydberg atoms</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05494</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Jose Soto, Natalia Chepiga&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Experiments on chains of Rydberg atoms appear as a new playground to study quantum phase transitions in 1D. As a natural extension, we report a quantitative ground-state phase diagram of Rydberg atoms arranged in a two-leg ladder that interact via van der Waals potential. We address this problem numerically, using the Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) algorithm. Our results suggest that, surprisingly enough, $\mathbb{Z}_k$ crystalline phases, with the exception of the checkerboard phase, appear in pairs characterized by the same pattern of occupied rungs but distinguishable by a spontaneously broken $\tilde{\mathbb{Z}}_2$ symmetry between the two legs of the ladder. Within each pair, the two phases are separated by a continuous transition in the Ising universality class, which eventually fuses with the $\mathbb{Z}_k$ transition, whose nature depends on $k$. According to our results, the transition into the $\mathbb{Z}_2\otimes \tilde{\mathbb{Z}}_2$ phase changes its nature multiple of times and, over extended intervals, falls first into the Ashkin-Teller, latter into the $\mathbb{Z}_4$-chiral universality class and finally in a two step-process mediated by a floating phase. The transition into the $\mathbb{Z}_3$ phase with resonant states on the rungs belongs to the three-state Potts universality class at the commensurate point, to the $\mathbb{Z}_3$-chiral Huse-Fisher universality class away from it, and eventually it is through an intermediate floating phase. The Ising transition between $\mathbb{Z}_3$ and $\mathbb{Z}_3\otimes \tilde{\mathbb{Z}}_2$ phases, coming across the floating phase, opens the possibility to realize lattice supersymmetry in Rydberg quantum simulators.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05494'&gt;arXiv:2411.05494&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 08 Nov 2024 11:51:50 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Phases of decodability in the surface code with unitary errors</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05785</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Yimu Bao, Sajant Anand&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The maximum likelihood (ML) decoder in the two-dimensional surface code with generic unitary errors is governed by a statistical mechanics model with complex weights, which can be simulated via (1+1)D transfer matrix contraction. Information loss with an increasing error rate manifests as a ferromagnetic-to-paramagnetic transition in the contraction dynamics. In this work, we establish entanglement as a separate obstruction to decoding; it can undergo a transition from area- to volume-law scaling in the transfer matrix contraction with increasing unitary error rate. In particular, the volume-law entanglement can coexist with ferromagnetic order, giving rise to a phase in which the encoded information is retained yet is effectively undecodable. We numerically simulate the ML decoding in the surface code subject to both single- and two-qubit Pauli-X rotations and obtain a phase diagram that contains a ferromagnetic area-law, a paramagnetic volume-law, and a potential ferromagnetic volume-law phase. We further show that, starting from the paramagnetic volume-law phase, tilting the single-qubit rotation away from the X-axis couples the stat-mech models for X and Z errors and can lead to a ferromagnetic volume-law phase in which, although Z errors remain correctable, the encoded classical information is hard to recover. To perform numerical simulations, we develop an algorithm for syndrome sampling based on the isometric tensor network representation of the surface code.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05785'&gt;arXiv:2411.05785&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 08 Nov 2024 18:52:59 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Over-parameterized Student Model via Tensor Decomposition Boosted Knowledge Distillation</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Yu-Liang Zhan, Zhong-Yi Lu, Hao Sun, Ze-Feng Gao&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Increased training parameters have enabled large pre-trained models to excel in various downstream tasks. Nevertheless, the extensive computational requirements associated with these models hinder their widespread adoption within the community. We focus on Knowledge Distillation (KD), where a compact student model is trained to mimic a larger teacher model, facilitating the transfer of knowledge of large models. In contrast to much of the previous work, we scale up the parameters of the student model during training, to benefit from overparameterization without increasing the inference latency. In particular, we propose a tensor decomposition strategy that effectively over-parameterizes the relatively small student model through an efficient and nearly lossless decomposition of its parameter matrices into higher-dimensional tensors. To ensure efficiency, we further introduce a tensor constraint loss to align the high-dimensional tensors between the student and teacher models. Comprehensive experiments validate the significant performance enhancement by our approach in various KD tasks, covering computer vision and natural language processing areas.

      <title>Condensation of Composite Bosonic Trions in Interacting Bose-Fermi Mixtures</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Qi Song, Jie Lou, Yan Chen&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We reveal a quantum coherent state characterized by composite bosonic trions, wherein paired fermions further bind with bosons, in one-dimensional Bose-Fermi mixtures.This phase emerges in two separate models, both featuring onsite boson-fermion attraction that induces negative binding energy for the composite trions. The first is the pair-hopping model, in which spinless fermions undergo pair hopping to form preformed pairs. The second is the extended Bose-Fermi Hubbard model, describing dipolar bosons and fermions with density-density interactions. Notably, the formation of composite trions is independent of the specific pairing interactions of fermions. Extensive density matrix renormalization group calculations demonstrate the quasi-condensation of the composite trions, evidenced by algebraically decaying correlations of trions, gapped single-particle excitations, and suppressed fermion pair correlations. Our findings provide valuable insights into the three-body pairing mechanism in mixed-particle systems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06854'&gt;arXiv:2411.06854&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 11 Nov 2024 10:37:02 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Model order reduction of parametric dynamical systems by slice sampling tensor completion</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07151</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Alexander V. Mamonov, Maxim A. Olshanskii&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Recent studies have demonstrated the great potential of reduced order modeling for parametric dynamical systems using low-rank tensor decompositions (LRTD). In particular, within the framework of interpolatory tensorial reduced order models (ROM), LRTD is computed for tensors composed of snapshots of the system's solutions, where each parameter corresponds to a distinct tensor mode. This approach requires full sampling of the parameter domain on a tensor product grid, which suffers from the curse of dimensionality, making it practical only for systems with a small number of parameters. To overcome this limitation, we propose a sparse sampling of the parameter domain, followed by a low-rank tensor completion. The resulting specialized tensor completion problem is formulated for a tensor of order $C + D$, where $C$ fully sampled modes correspond to the snapshot degrees of freedom, and $D$ partially sampled modes correspond to the system's parameters. To address this non-standard tensor completion problem, we introduce a low-rank tensor format called the hybrid tensor train. Completion in this format is then integrated into an interpolatory tensorial ROM. We demonstrate the effectiveness of both the completion method and the ROM on several examples of dynamical systems derived from finite element discretizations of parabolic partial differential equations with parameter-dependent coefficients or boundary conditions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07151'&gt;arXiv:2411.07151&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 11 Nov 2024 17:25:02 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

In AFQMC, a good trial wavefunction to guide the random walk is crucial for improving the sampling efficiency and controlling the sign problem. Our proposed method iterates between determining a new trial wavefunction in the form of a tensor train, derived from the current walkers, and using this updated trial wavefunction to anchor the next phase of AFQMC. Numerical results demonstrate that the algorithm is highly accurate for large spin systems. The overlap between the estimated trial wavefunction and the ground-state wavefunction also achieves high fidelity. We additionally provide a convergence analysis, highlighting how an effective trial wavefunction can reduce the variance in the AFQMC energy estimation. From a complementary perspective, our algorithm also extends the reach of tensor-train methods for studying quantum many-body systems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07194'&gt;arXiv:2411.07194&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 11 Nov 2024 18:10:53 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>High-temperature superconductivity from kinetic energy</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07292</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Hanbit Oh, Hui Yang, Ya-Hui Zhang&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Superconductivity is usually assumed to arise from attractive interaction. In this work we show that strong pairing is possible soley from kinetic energy even without a net attraction. We demonstrate a high-temperature kinetic superconductor in a simple lattice model with nearest-neighbor hopping ($t$) projected onto a constrained Hilbert space, analogous to the $t$-$J$ model with $J=0$, where kinetic magnetism has been previously studied. Using density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) on cylinders up to width $L_y=8$, we find a superconducting ground state exhibiting a key difference from high-$T_c$ cuprates: both the pairing gap and phase stiffness \textit{increase} with doping ($x$). We find pairing gaps, determined from spin and single-electron charge gaps, exceeding $1.5t$. This model can be realized within the double Kondo lattice model, relevant to bilayer nickelates, in the limit of strong inter-layer spin coupling ($J_\perp/t \rightarrow +\infty$) and a balancing inter-layer repulsion ($V$). Importantly, the double Kondo model does not fundamentally restrict $J_\perp/t$, suggesting the potential for high critical temperatures ($T_c$) approaching $0.5t$. While this idealized limit predicts large pairing gaps, we show a smooth connection to the more realistic regime with $J_\perp \sim t$, albeit with a reduced pairing gap of approximately $0.1t$. Assuming $t \sim 10^3$ K in typical solid state systems, our model suggests the exciting possibility of achieving $T_c$ of hundreds of Kelvin. We propose searching for bilayer materials with reduced out-of-plane lattice constants to better approximate the conditions of our ideal model.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07292'&gt;arXiv:2411.07292&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 11 Nov 2024 19:00:03 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Density matrix renormalization group in the discrete variable representation basis</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Bing Gu&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We present a numerical implementation of the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) using the discrete variable representation (DVR) basis set. One main advantage of using the local DVR basis sets is that the computations of one-electron integral and two-electron repulsion integrals are drastically simplified. For comparison, we further implemented DVR complete active space configuration interaction (CASCI) using canonical molecular orbitals. These methods are applied to a one-dimensional pseudo-hydrogen chain under screened Coulomb potential. The DMRG ground state energy agrees with CASCI up to 0.1 mEh with a very small number of bond dimensions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07477'&gt;arXiv:2411.07477&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 12 Nov 2024 01:46:09 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Stochastic resonance in vibrational polariton chemistry</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Yaling Ke&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; In this work, we systematically investigate the impact of ambient noise intensity on the rate modifications of ground-state chemical reactions in an optical cavity under vibrational strong-coupling conditions. To achieve this, we utilize a numerically exact open quantum system approach--the hierarchical equations of motion in twin space, combined with a flexible tree tensor network state solver. Our findings reveal a stochastic resonance phenomenon in cavity-modified chemical reactivities: an optimal reaction rate enhancement occurs at an intermediate noise level. In other words, this enhancement diminishes if ambient noise, sensed by the cavity-molecule system through cavity leakage, is either too weak or excessively strong. In the collective coupling regime, when the cavity is weakly damped, rate enhancement strengthens as more molecules couple to the cavity. In contrast, under strong cavity damping, reaction rates decline as the number of molecules grows.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07616'&gt;arXiv:2411.07616&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 12 Nov 2024 07:50:07 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Superpositions of tree-tensor networks for single-reference ground states in the strong correlation regime</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08036</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Dominic Bergeron&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The fermionic many-body problem in the strong correlation regime is notoriously difficult to tackle. In a previous work (Phys. Rev. B 101, 045109 (2020)), we have proposed to extend the single-reference coupled-cluster (SRCC) method to the strong correlation regime using low-rank tensor decompositions (LRTD) to express the cluster operator, without truncating it with respect to the number of excitations. For that purpose, we have proposed a new type of LRTD called ``superpositions of tree-tensor networks'' (STTN), which use the same set of building blocs to define all the tensors involved in the CC equations, and combine different ``channels'', i.e. different types of pairing among excited particles and holes, in the decomposition of a given tensor. Those two principles are aimed at globally minimizing the total number of free parameters required to accurately represent the ground state. In this work, we show that STTN can indeed be compact and accurate representations of strongly correlated ground states by using them to express the CC cluster operator amplitudes and wave function coefficients of exact grounds states of small two-dimensional Hubbard clusters, at half-filling, up to three particle-hole excitations. We show the compactness of STTN by using a number of free parameters smaller than the number of equations in the CCSD approximation, i.e. much smaller than the number of fitted tensor elements. We find that, for the systems considered, the STTN are more accurate as the size of the system increases and that combining different channels in the decompositions of the most strongly correlated tensors is crucial to obtain good accuracy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08036'&gt;arXiv:2411.08036&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 12 Nov 2024 18:59:59 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Transition between critical antiferromagnetic phases in the $J_1$-$J_2$ spin chain</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Adam J. McRoberts, Chris Hooley, A. G. Green&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The $J_1$--$J_2$ spin chain is one of the canonical models of quantum magnetism, and has long been known to host a critical antiferromagnetic phase with power-law decay of spin correlations. We show in this letter that there are, in fact, two distinct critical phases: the `Affleck-Haldane' phase, where the dimer field that parametrises local singlet order is part of a joint $O(4)$ Néel-singlet order parameter; and the `Zirnbauer' phase, where the dimer field is gapped out and the critical theory involves only an $O(3)$ Néel order parameter. The phases are so-named because each realises one of the competing pictures for how the $O(3)$ non-linear sigma model with a topological theta term renormalises to the $\mathfrak{\hat{su}}(2)_1$ Wess-Zumino-Witten model.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08095'&gt;arXiv:2411.08095&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 12 Nov 2024 19:00:00 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>(2+1) Lorentzian quantum cosmology from spin-foams: opportunities and obstacles for semi-classicality</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08109</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Alexander F. Jercher, José Diogo Simão, Sebastian Steinhaus&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We construct an effective cosmological spin-foam model for a (2+1) dimensional spatially flat universe, discretized on a hypercubical lattice, containing both space- and time-like regions. Our starting point is the recently proposed coherent state spin-foam model for (2+1) Lorentzian quantum gravity. The full amplitude is assumed to factorize into single vertex amplitudes with boundary data corresponding to Lorentzian 3-frusta. A stationary phase approximation is performed at each vertex individually, where the inverse square root of the Hessian determinant serves as a measure for the effective path integral. Additionally, a massive scalar field is coupled to the geometry, and we show that its mass renders the partition function convergent. For a single 3-frustum with time-like struts, we compute the expectation value of the bulk strut length and show that it generically agrees with the classical solutions and that it is a discontinuous function of the scalar field mass. Allowing the struts to be space-like introduces causality violations, which drive the expectation values away from the classical solutions due to the lack of an exponential suppression of these configurations. This is a direct consequence of the semi-classical amplitude only containing the real part of deficit angles, in contrast with the Lorentzian Regge action used in effective spin-foams. We give an outlook on how to evaluate the partition function on an extended discretization including a bulk spatial slice. This serves as a foundation for future investigations of physically interesting scenarios such as a quantum bounce or the viability of massive scalar field clocks. Our results demonstrate that the effective path integral in the causally regular sector serves as a viable quantum cosmology model, but that the agreement of expectation values with classical solutions is tightly bound to the path integral measure.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08109'&gt;arXiv:2411.08109&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 12 Nov 2024 19:00:02 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Realizing Quantum Kernel Models at Scale with Matrix Product State Simulation</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09336</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Mekena Metcalf, Pablo Andrés-Martínez, Nathan Fitzpatrick&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Data representation in quantum state space offers an alternative function space for machine learning tasks. However, benchmarking these algorithms at a practical scale has been limited by ineffective simulation methods. We develop a quantum kernel framework using a Matrix Product State (MPS) simulator and employ it to perform a classification task with 165 features and 6400 training data points, well beyond the scale of any prior work. We make use of a circuit ansatz on a linear chain of qubits with increasing interaction distance between qubits. We assess the MPS simulator performance on CPUs and GPUs and, by systematically increasing the qubit interaction distance, we identify a crossover point beyond which the GPU implementation runs faster. We show that quantum kernel model performance improves as the feature dimension and training data increases, which is the first evidence of quantum model performance at scale.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09336'&gt;arXiv:2411.09336&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 14 Nov 2024 10:33:07 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Entropy dynamics of the binary bond disordered Heisenberg chain</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09368</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Di Han, Yankui Bai, Yang Zhao&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; In this article, we study the quench dynamics of the binary bond disordered Heisenberg spin chain. First, we develop a new algorithm, the ancilla TEBD method, which combines the purification technique and the time-evolving block decimation (TEBD) algorithm to study the entanglement dynamics of binary bonded disordered spin chains. With the support of exact diagonalization (ED), we calculate the multifaractal dimension of the binary bond disordered Heisenberg spin model and study its dependence on the strength of the disorder potential; we find that the multifaractal dimension shows no critical behavior which rules out the existence of the many body localization transition. Then, we reproduce the long time scaling of the von Neumann entropy at the time scale that is beyond the reach of typical TEBD and time dependent density matrix renormalization group (tDMRG) algorithms. Based on the numerical analysis, we propose that such a long time scaling is due to the competition of the spin interaction and the disorder which can be seen as a new mechanism for the generating of long time scale entropy dynamics. At last, we numerically proved the existence of the transient Mpemba effect in the bond disordered Heisenberg chain.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09368'&gt;arXiv:2411.09368&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 14 Nov 2024 11:18:37 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Spectral decomposition and high-accuracy Greens functions: Overcoming the Nyquist-Shannon limit via complex-time Krylov expansion</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09680</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Sebastian Paeckel&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The accurate computation of low-energy spectra of strongly correlated quantum many-body systems, typically accessed via Greens-functions, is a long-standing problem posing enormous challenges to numerical methods. When the spectral decomposition is obtained from Fourier transforming a time series, the Nyquist-Shannon theorem limits the frequency resolution $\Delta\omega$ according to the numerically accessible time domain size $T$ via $\Delta\omega = 2/T$. In tensor network methods, increasing the domain size is exponentially hard due to the ubiquitous spread of correlations, limiting the frequency resolution and thereby restricting this ansatz class mostly to one-dimensional systems with small quasi-particle velocities. Here, we show how this fundamental limitation can be overcome using complex-time Krylov spaces. At the example of the critical $S-1/2$ Heisenberg model and light bipolarons in the two-dimensional Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model, we demonstrate the enormous improvements in accuracy, which can be achieved using this method.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09680'&gt;arXiv:2411.09680&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 14 Nov 2024 18:45:59 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Quantum-assisted Stacking Sequence Retrieval and Laminated Composite Design</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10303</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Arne Wulff, Swapan Madabhushi Venkata, Boyang Chen, Sebastian Feld, Matthias Möller, Yinglu Tang&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We, the QAIMS lab lab at the Aerospace Faculty of TU Delft, participated as finalists in the Airbus/BMW Quantum Computing Challenge 2024. Stacking sequence retrieval, a complex combinatorial task within a bi-level optimization framework, is crucial for designing laminated composites that meet aerospace requirements for weight, strength, and stiffness. This document presents the scientifically relevant sections of our submission, which builds on our prior research on applying quantum computation to this challenging design problem. For the competition, we expanded our previous work in several significant ways. First, we incorporated a full set of manufacturing constraints into our algorithmic framework, including those previously established theoretically but not yet demonstrated, thereby aligning our approach more closely with real-world manufacturing demands. We implemented the F-VQE algorithm, which enhances the probability shaping of optimal solutions, improving on simpler variational quantum algorithms. Our approach also demonstrates flexibility by accommodating diverse objectives as well as finer ply-angle increments alongside the previously demonstrated conventional ply angles. Scalability was tested using the DMRG algorithm, which, despite limitations in entanglement representation, enabled simulations with up to 200 plies. Results were directly compared to conventional stacking sequence retrieval algorithms with DMRG showing high competitiveness. Given DMRG's limited entanglement capabilities, it serves as a conservative baseline, suggesting potential for even greater performance on fully realized quantum systems. This document serves to make our competition results publicly available as we prepare a formal publication on these findings and their implications for aerospace materials design optimization.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10303'&gt;arXiv:2411.10303&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 15 Nov 2024 15:59:46 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Simulating the two-dimensional $t-J$ model at finite doping with neural quantum states</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10430</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Hannah Lange, Annika Böhler, Christopher Roth, Annabelle Bohrdt&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Simulating large, strongly interacting fermionic systems remains a major challenge for existing numerical methods. In this work, we introduce Gutzwiller projected hidden fermion determinant states (G-HFDS) to simulate the strongly interacting limit of the Fermi-Hubbard model, namely the $t$-$J$ model, across the entire doping regime. We demonstrate that the G-HFDS achieve energies competitive with matrix product states (MPS) on lattices as large as $10 \times 10$ sites while using several orders of magnitude fewer parameters, suggesting the potential for efficient application to even larger system sizes. This remarkable efficiency enables us to probe low-energy physics across the full doping range, providing new insights into the competition between kinetic and magnetic interactions and the nature of emergent quasiparticles. Starting from the low-doping regime, where magnetic polarons dominate the low energy physics, we track their evolution with increasing doping and different next-nearest neighbor hopping amplitudes through analyses of spin and polaron correlation functions as well as the Fermi surface. Our findings demonstrate the potential of determinant-based neural quantum states with inherent fermionic sign structure, opening the way for simulating large-scale fermionic systems at any particle filling.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10430'&gt;arXiv:2411.10430&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 15 Nov 2024 18:51:07 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

In this work, we design a QTT-FE method for time-domain acoustic wave equations, combining stable low-rank approximation in space with a suitable conservative discretization in time. For the acoustic wave equation with a homogeneous source term in a single space dimension as a model problem, we consider its reformulation as a first-order system in time. In space, we employ a low-rank QTT-FEM discretization based on continuous piecewise linear finite elements corresponding to uniformly refined nested meshes. Time integration is performed using symplectic high-order Gauss-Legendre Runge-Kutta methods. In our numerical experiments, we investigate the energy conservation and exponential convergence of the proposed method.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11321'&gt;arXiv:2411.11321&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 18 Nov 2024 06:31:12 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Encoding of Probability Distributions for Quantum Monte Carlo Using Tensor Networks</title>

Scursulim, Samurai Brito&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The application of Tensor Networks (TN) in quantum computing has shown promise, particularly for data loading. However, the assumption that data is readily available often renders the integration of TN techniques into Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) inefficient, as complete probability distributions would have to be calculated classically. In this paper the tensor-train cross approximation (TT-cross) algorithm is evaluated as a means to address the probability loading problem. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method on financial distributions, showcasing the TT-cross approach's scalability and accuracy. Our results indicate that the TT-cross method significantly improves circuit depth scalability compared to traditional methods, offering a more efficient pathway for implementing QMC on near-term quantum hardware. The approach also shows high accuracy and scalability in handling high-dimensional financial data, making it a promising solution for quantum finance applications.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11660'&gt;arXiv:2411.11660&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 18 Nov 2024 15:37:37 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Stabilizer disentangling of conformal field theories</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11720</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Martina Frau, Poetri Sonya Tarabunga, Mario Collura, Emanuele Tirrito, Marcello Dalmonte&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Understanding how entanglement can be reduced through simple operations is crucial for both classical and quantum algorithms. We investigate the entanglement properties of lattice models hosting conformal field theories cooled via local Clifford operations, a procedure we refer to as stabilizer disentangling. We uncover two distinct regimes: a constant gain regime, where disentangling is volume-independent, and a log-gain regime, where disentanglement increases with volume, characterized by a reduced effective central charge. In both cases, disentangling efficiency correlates with the target state magic, with larger magic leading to more effective cooling. The dichotomy between the two cases stems from mutual stabilizer Renyi entropy, which influences the entanglement cooling process. We provide an analytical understanding of such effect in the context of cluster Ising models, that feature disentangling global Clifford operations. Our findings indicate that matrix product states possess subclasses based on the relationship between entanglement and magic, and clarifying the potential of new classes of variational states embedding Clifford dynamics within matrix product states.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11720'&gt;arXiv:2411.11720&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 18 Nov 2024 16:50:47 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Exact physical quantities of the XYZ spin chain in the thermodynamic limit</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12200</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Zhirong Xin, Junpeng Cao, Wen-Li Yang, Yupeng Wang&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The thermodynamic limits of the XYZ spin chain with periodic or twisted boundary conditions are studied. By using the technique of characterizing the eigenvalue of the transfer matrix by the $T-Q$ relation and by the zeros of the associated polynomial, we obtain the constraints of the Bethe roots and the zeros for the eigenvalues. With the help of structure of Bethe roots, we obtain the distribution patterns of zeros. Based on them, the physical quantities such as the surface energy and excitation energy are calculated. We find that both of them depend on the parity of sites number due to the topological long-range Neel order on the Mobius manifold in the spin space. We also check our results with those obtaining by the density matrix renormalization group. The method provided in this paper can be applied to study the thermodynamic properties at the thermal equilibrium state with finite temperature.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12200'&gt;arXiv:2411.12200&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 19 Nov 2024 03:35:15 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>An Eulerian approach to regularized JKO scheme with low-rank tensor decompositions for Bayesian inversion</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12430</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Vitalii Aksenov, Martin Eigel&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The possibility of using the Eulerian discretization for the problem of modelling high-dimensional distributions and sampling, is studied. The problem is posed as a minimization problem over the space of probability measures with respect to the Wasserstein distance and solved with entropy-regularized JKO scheme. Each proximal step can be formulated as a fixed-point equation and solved with accelerated methods, such as Anderson's. The usage of low-rank Tensor Train format allows to overcome the \emph{curse of dimensionality}, i.e. the exponential growth of degrees of freedom with dimension, inherent to Eulerian approaches. The resulting method requires only pointwise computations of the unnormalized posterior and is, in particular, gradient-free. Fixed Eulerian grid allows to employ a caching strategy, significally reducing the expensive evaluations of the posterior. When the Eulerian model of the target distribution is fitted, the passage back to the Lagrangian perspective can also be made, allowing to approximately sample from it. We test our method both for synthetic target distributions and particular Bayesian inverse problems and report comparable or better performance than the baseline Metropolis-Hastings MCMC with same amount of resources. Finally, the fitted model can be modified to facilitate the solution of certain associated problems, which we demonstrate by fitting an importance distribution for a particular quantity of interest.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12430'&gt;arXiv:2411.12430&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 19 Nov 2024 11:40:56 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Stabilizer Tensor Networks with Magic State Injection</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12482</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Azar C. Nakhl, Ben Harper, Maxwell West, Neil Dowling, Martin Sevior, Thomas Quella, Muhammad Usman&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; This work augments the recently introduced Stabilizer Tensor Network (STN) protocol with magic state injection, reporting a new framework with significantly enhanced ability to simulate circuits with an extensive number of non-Clifford operations. Specifically, for random $T$-doped $N$-qubit Clifford circuits the computational cost of circuits prepared with magic state injection scales as $\mathcal{O}(\text{poly}(N))$ when the circuit has $t \lesssim N$ $T$-gates compared to an exponential scaling for the STN approach, which is demonstrated in systems of up to $200$ qubits. In the case of the Hidden Bit Shift circuit, a paradigmatic benchmarking system for extended stabilizer methods with a tunable amount of magic, we report that our magic state injected STN framework can efficiently simulate $4000$ qubits and $320$ $T$-gates. These findings provide a promising outlook for the use of this protocol in the classical modelling of quantum circuits that are conventionally difficult to simulate efficiently.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12482'&gt;arXiv:2411.12482&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 19 Nov 2024 13:03:27 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Disentangling critical quantum spin chains with Clifford circuits</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12683</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Chaohui Fan, Xiangjian Qian, Hua-Chen Zhang, Rui-Zhen Huang, Mingpu Qin, Tao Xiang&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Clifford circuits can be utilized to disentangle quantum states with polynomial cost, thanks to the Gottesman-Knill theorem. Based on this idea, the Clifford circuits augmented matrix product states (CAMPS) method, which is a seamless integration of Clifford circuits within the density-matrix renormalization group algorithm, was proposed recently and was shown to be able to reduce entanglement in various quantum systems. In this work, we further explore the power of the CAMPS method in critical spin chains described by conformal field theories (CFTs) in the scaling limit. We find that the optimized disentanglers correspond to {\it duality} transformations, which significantly reduce the entanglement entropy in the ground state. For the critical quantum Ising spin chain governed by the Ising CFT with self-duality, the Clifford circuits found by CAMPS coincide with the duality transformation, i.e., the Kramers-Wannier self-duality in the critical Ising chain. It reduces the entanglement entropy by mapping the free conformal boundary condition to the fixed one. In the more general case of the XXZ chain, the CAMPS gives rise to a duality transformation mapping the model to the quantum Ashkin-Teller spin chain. Our results highlight the potential of the framework as a versatile tool for uncovering hidden dualities and simplifying the entanglement structure of critical quantum systems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12683'&gt;arXiv:2411.12683&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 19 Nov 2024 17:39:54 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Finite-size scaling on the torus with periodic projected entangled-pair states</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12731</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Gleb Fedorovich, Lukas Devos, Jutho Haegeman, Laurens Vanderstraeten, Frank Verstraete, Atsushi Ueda&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; An efficient algorithm is constructed for contracting two-dimensional tensor networks under periodic boundary conditions. The central ingredient is a novel renormalization step that scales linearly with system size, i.e. from $L \to L+1$. The numerical accuracy is comparable to state-of-the-art tensor network methods, while giving access to much more data points, and at a lower computational cost. Combining this contraction routine with the use of automatic differentiation, we arrive at an efficient algorithm for optimizing fully translation invariant projected entangled-pair states on the torus. Our benchmarks show that this method yields finite-size energy results that are comparable to those from quantum Monte Carlo simulations. When combined with field-theoretical scaling techniques, our approach enables accurate estimates of critical properties for two-dimensional quantum lattice systems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12731'&gt;arXiv:2411.12731&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 19 Nov 2024 18:56:31 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Ab-Initio Approach to Many-Body Quantum Spin Dynamics</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13190</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Aditya Dubey, Zeki Zeybek, Fabian Köhler, Rick Mukherjee, Peter Schmelcher&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; A fundamental longstanding problem in studying spin models is the efficient and accurate numerical simulation of the long-time behavior of larger systems. The exponential growth of the Hilbert space and the entanglement accumulation at long times pose major challenges for current methods. To address these issues, we employ the multilayer multiconfiguration time-dependent Hartree (ML-MCTDH) framework to simulate the many-body spin dynamics of the Heisenberg model in various settings, including the Ising and XYZ limits with different interaction ranges and random couplings. Benchmarks with analytical and exact numerical approaches show that ML-MCTDH accurately captures the time evolution of one- and two-body observables in both one- and two-dimensional lattices. A comparison with the discrete truncated Wigner approximation (DTWA) highlights that ML-MCTDH is particularly well-suited for handling anisotropic models and provides more reliable results for two-point observables across all tested cases. The behavior of the corresponding entanglement dynamics is analyzed to reveal the complexity of the quantum states. Our findings indicate that the rate of entanglement growth strongly depends on the interaction range and the presence of disorder. This particular relationship is then used to examine the convergence behavior of ML-MCTDH. Our results indicate that the multilayer structure of ML-MCTDH is a promising numerical framework for handling the dynamics of generic many-body spin systems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13190'&gt;arXiv:2411.13190&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 20 Nov 2024 10:42:35 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Effective dimensional reduction of complex systems based on tensor networks</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13364</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Wout Merbis, Madelon Geurts, Clélia de Mulatier, Philippe Corboz&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The exact treatment of Markovian models of complex systems requires knowledge of probability distributions exponentially large in the number of components $n$. Mean-field approximations provide an effective reduction in complexity of the models, requiring only a number of phase space variables polynomial in system size. However, this comes at the cost of losing accuracy close to critical points in the systems dynamics and an inability to capture correlations in the system. In this work, we introduce a tunable approximation scheme for Markovian spreading models on networks based on Matrix Product States (MPS). By controlling the bond dimensions of the MPS, we can investigate the effective dimensionality needed to accurately represent the exact $2^n$ dimensional steady-state distribution. We introduce the entanglement entropy as a measure of the compressibility of the system and find that it peaks just after the phase transition on the disordered side, in line with the intuition that more complex states are at the 'edge of chaos'. We compare the accuracy of the MPS with exact methods on different types of small random networks and with Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods for a simplified version of the railway network of the Netherlands with 55 nodes. The MPS provides a systematic way to tune the accuracy of the approximation by reducing the dimensionality of the systems state vector, leading to an improvement over second-order mean-field approximations for sufficiently large bond dimensions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13364'&gt;arXiv:2411.13364&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 20 Nov 2024 14:38:10 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Numerical study of bi-layer two-orbital model for La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7}$ on a plaquette ladder</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13399</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Yang Shen, Jiale Huang, Xiangjian Qian, Guang-Ming Zhang, Mingpu Qin&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The recently discovered high-$T_c$ superconductivity in La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7}$ with $T_c \approx 80K$ provides another intriguing platform to explore the microscopic mechanism of unconventional superconductivity. In this work, we study a previously proposed bi-layer two-orbital model Hamiltonian for La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7}$ [Y. Shen, et al, Chinese Physics Letters 40, 127401 (2023)] on a plaquette ladder, which is a minimum setup with two-dimensional characteristic. We employ large-scale Density Matrix Renormalization Group calculations to accurately determine the ground state of the model. We determine the density, magnetic structure, and the pairing property of the model. We find that with large effective inter-layer anti-ferromagnetic exchange for the 3$d_{z^2}$ orbital, both spin, charge, and pairing correlation display quasi-long-range behavior, which could be viewed as a precursor of possible true long-range order in the two dimensional limit. Interestingly, sign oscillation for the pairing correlation are observed for both the 3$d_{x^2-y^2}$ and 3$d_{z^2}$ orbitals, indicating the presence of possible pair density wave in the system. Even though we only study the model on a quasi one-dimensional plaquette ladder geometry due to the computational difficulty, the results on the spin, charge, and pairing correlation provide valuable insight in the clarification of the properties of La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7}$ in the future.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13399'&gt;arXiv:2411.13399&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 20 Nov 2024 15:36:23 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Real-Time Scattering in Ising Field Theory using Matrix Product States</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13645</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Raghav G. Jha, Ashley Milsted, Dominik Neuenfeld, John Preskill, Pedro Vieira&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We study scattering in Ising Field Theory (IFT) using matrix product states and the time-dependent variational principle. IFT is a one-parameter family of strongly coupled non-integrable quantum field theories in 1+1 dimensions, interpolating between massive free fermion theory and Zamolodchikov's integrable massive $E_8$ theory. Particles in IFT may scatter either elastically or inelastically. In the post-collision wavefunction, particle tracks from all final-state channels occur in superposition; processes of interest can be isolated by projecting the wavefunction onto definite particle sectors, or by evaluating energy density correlation functions. Using numerical simulations we determine the time delay of elastic scattering and the probability of inelastic particle production as a function of collision energy. We also study the mass and width of the lightest resonance near the $E_8$ point in detail. Close to both the free fermion and $E_8$ theories, our results for both elastic and inelastic scattering are in good agreement with expectations from form-factor perturbation theory. Using numerical computations to go beyond the regime accessible by perturbation theory, we find that the high energy behavior of the two-to-two particle scattering probability in IFT is consistent with a conjecture of Zamolodchikov. Our results demonstrate the efficacy of tensor-network methods for simulating the real-time dynamics of strongly coupled quantum field theories in 1+1 dimensions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13645'&gt;arXiv:2411.13645&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 20 Nov 2024 19:00:01 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Multi-impurity method for the bond-weighted tensor renormalization group</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Satoshi Morita, Naoki Kawashima&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We propose a multi-impurity method for the bond-weighted tensor renormalization group (BWTRG) to compute the higher-order moment of physical quantities in a two-dimensional system. The replacement of the bond weight with an impurity matrix in a bond-weighted triad tensor network represents a physical quantity such as the magnetization and the energy. We demonstrate that the accuracy of the proposed method is much higher than the conventional tensor renormalization group for the Ising model and the five-state Potts model. Furthermore, we perform the finite-size scaling analysis and observe that the dimensionless quantity characterizing the structure of the fixed point tensor satisfies the same scaling relation in the critical region as the Binder parameter. The estimated critical temperature dependence on the bond dimension indicates that the exponent relating the correlation length to the bond dimension varies continuously with respect to the BWTRG hyperparameter. We find that BWTRG with the optimal hyperparameter is more efficient in terms of computational time than alternative approaches based on the matrix product state in estimating the critical temperature.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13998'&gt;arXiv:2411.13998&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 21 Nov 2024 10:23:46 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

By integrating the Gutzwiller-guided density matrix renormalization group method with analytical analyses, we present clear evidence that the ground state is a Z$_2$ Dirac spin liquid. This state can be efficiently described by a Gutzwiller-projected parton theory characterized by its projective symmetry group. To distinguish the difference between the projected Z$_2$ and U(1) parton state, we investigate the chiral spin liquid ground states as topological orders by incorporating a $J_\chi$ term into the $J_1$-$J_2$ model and observe a transition from a Z$_2$ chiral spin liquid to a U(1)$_2$ chiral spin liquid as $J_\chi$ increases.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14114'&gt;arXiv:2411.14114&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 21 Nov 2024 13:19:01 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Edge-Edge Correlations without Edge-States: $η$-clustering State as Ground State of the Extended Attractive SU(3) Hubbard Chain</title>

In the large on-site attraction limit, we identify three different phases: phase separation (PS), Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid (TLL), and charge density wave (CDW). Our analysis reveals that the $\eta$-clustering state, a three-component generalization of the $\eta$-pairing state, becomes the ground state at the boundary between the PS and TLL phases. On an open chain, this state exhibits an edge-edge correlation, which we call boundary off-diagonal long-range order (bODLRO). Using the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) method, we numerically study the phase diagram of the model with large but finite on-site interactions and find that the numerical results align with those obtained in the strong coupling limit.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14724'&gt;arXiv:2411.14724&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 22 Nov 2024 04:40:24 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Forestalled Phase Separation as the Precursor to Stripe Order</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15158</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Aritra Sinha, Alexander Wietek&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Stripe order is a prominent feature in the phase diagram of the high-temperature cuprate superconductors. It has been confirmed as the lowest-energy state of the two-dimensional Fermi Hubbard model in certain parameter regimes. Upon increasing the temperature, stripes and the superconducting state give way to the enigmatic strange-metal and pseudogap regimes, whose precise nature remains a long-standing puzzle. Using modern tensor network techniques, we discover a crucial aspect of these regimes. Infinite projected entangled pair states (iPEPS) simulations in the fully two-dimensional limit reveal a maximum in the charge susceptibility at temperatures above the stripe order. This maximum is located around filling $n=0.9$ and intensifies upon cooling. Using minimally entangled typical thermal states (METTS) on finite cylinders, we attribute the enhanced charge susceptibility to the formation of charge clusters, reminiscent of phase separation where the system is partitioned into hole-rich and hole-depleted regions. In contrast to genuine phase separation, the charge cluster sizes fluctuate without a divergent charge susceptibility. Hence, while this precursor state features clustering of charge carriers, true phase separation is ultimately forestalled at lower temperatures by the onset of stripe order.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15158'&gt;arXiv:2411.15158&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 08 Nov 2024 19:00:02 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Very Basics of Tensors with Graphical Notations: Unfolding, Calculations, and Decompositions</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16094</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Tatsuya Yokota&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Tensor network diagram (graphical notation) is a useful tool that graphically represents multiplications between multiple tensors using nodes and edges. Using the graphical notation, complex multiplications between tensors can be described simply and intuitively, and it also helps to understand the essence of tensor products. In fact, most of matrix/tensor products including inner product, outer product, Hadamard product, Kronecker product, and Khatri-Rao product can be written in graphical notation. These matrix/tensor operations are essential building blocks for the use of matrix/tensor decompositions in signal processing and machine learning. The purpose of this lecture note is to learn the very basics of tensors and how to represent them in mathematical symbols and graphical notation. Many papers using tensors omit these detailed definitions and explanations, which can be difficult for the reader. I hope this note will be of help to such readers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16094'&gt;arXiv:2411.16094&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 25 Nov 2024 05:02:35 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Bosonic Peierls state emerging from the one-dimensional Ising-Kondo interaction</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16357</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Jingtao Fan, Xiaofan Zhou, Suotang Jia&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; As an important effect induced by the particle-lattice interaction, the Peierls transition, a hot topic in condensed matter physics, is usually believed to occur in the one-dimensional fermionic systems. We here study a bosonic version of the one-dimensional Ising-Kondo lattice model, which describes itinerant bosons interact with the localized magnetic moments via only longitudinal Kondo exchange.\ We show that, by means of perturbation analysis and numerical density-matrix renormalization group method, a bosonic analog of the Peierls state can occur in proper parameters regimes. The Peierls state here is characterized by the formation of a long-range spin-density-wave order, the periodicity of which is set by the density of the itinerant bosons. The ground-state phase diagram is mapped out by extrapolating the finite-size results to thermodynamic limit. Apart from the bosonic Peierls state, we also reveal the presence of some other magnetic orders, including a paramagnetic phase and a ferromagnetic phase. We finally propose a possible experimental scheme with ultracold atoms in optical lattices. Our results broaden the frontiers of the current understanding of the one-dimensional particle-lattice interaction system.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16357'&gt;arXiv:2411.16357&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 25 Nov 2024 13:10:53 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Limitations of tensor network approaches for optimization and sampling: A comparison to quantum and classical Ising machines</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16431</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Anna Maria Dziubyna, Tomasz Śmierzchalski, Bartłomiej Gardas, Marek M. Rams, Masoud Mohseni&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Optimization problems pose challenges across various fields. In recent years, quantum annealers have emerged as a promising platform for tackling such challenges. To provide a new perspective, we develop a heuristic tensor network (TN) based algorithm to reveal the low-energy spectrum of Ising spin-glass systems with interaction graphs relevant to present-day quantum annealers. Our deterministic approach combines a branch-and-bound search strategy with an approximate calculation of marginals via TN contractions. Its application to quasi-two-dimensional lattices with large unit cells of up to 24 spins, realized in current quantum annealing processors, requires a dedicated approach that utilizes sparse structures in the TN representation and GPU hardware acceleration. We benchmark our approach on random problems defined on Pegasus and Zephyr graphs with up to a few thousand spins, comparing it against the D-Wave Advantage quantum annealer and Simulated Bifurcation algorithm. Apart from the quality of the best solutions, we compare the diversity of low-energy states sampled by all the solvers. For the biggest considered i.i.d. problems with over 5000 spins, the state-of-the-art TN approach leads to solutions that are $0.1\%$ to $1\%$ worse than the best solutions obtained by Ising machines while being two orders of magnitude slower. We attribute those results to approximate contraction failures. For embedded tile planting instances, our approach gets to approximately $0.1\%$ from the planted ground state, a factor of $3$ better than the Ising solvers. While all three methods can output diverse low-energy solutions, e.g., differing by at least a quarter of spins with energy error below $1\%$, our deterministic branch-and-bound approach finds sets of a few such states at most. On the other hand, both Ising machines prove capable of sampling sets of thousands of such solutions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16431'&gt;arXiv:2411.16431&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 25 Nov 2024 14:35:14 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Tower of Structured Excited States from Measurements</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17020</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Yuxuan Guo, Yuto Ashida&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Preparing highly entangled quantum states is a key challenge in quantum metrology and quantum information science. Measurements, especially those of global observables, offer a simple and efficient way to generate entanglement between subsystems when they are measured as a whole. We introduce a log-depth protocol leveraging quantum phase estimation to measure a global observable, such as total magnetization and momentum. We demonstrate its capability to prepare towers of structured excited states that are useful in quantum metrology; examples include quantum many-body scars in various models, including the Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki (AKLT) model, the constrained domain-wall model, and the spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ and spin-$1$ XX chains. The same method is also applicable to preparing the Dicke states of high weight. In addition, we propose a protocol for momentum measurement that avoids disturbing the system, facilitating the preparation of states beyond the above construction, such as the Arovas $A$ state of the AKLT Hamiltonian. Our results expand the utility of measurement-based approaches to accessing highly entangled states in quantum many-body systems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17020'&gt;arXiv:2411.17020&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 26 Nov 2024 01:07:46 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>From the Shastry-Sutherland model to the $J_1$-$J_2$ Heisenberg model</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17452</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Xiangjian Qian, Rongyi Lv, Jong Yeon Lee, Mingpu Qin&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We propose a generalized Shastry-Sutherland model which bridges the Shastry-Sutherland model and the $J_1$-$J_2$ Heisenberg model. By employing large scale Density Matrix Renormalization Group and Fully Augmented Matrix Product State calculations, combined with careful finite-size scaling, we find the phase transition between the plaquette valence bond state (PVBS) and Neel anti-ferromagnetic (AFM) phase in the pure Shastry-Sutherland model is a weak first one. This result indicates the existence of an exotic tri-critical point in the PVBS to AFM transition line in the phase diagram, as the transition in the $J_1$-$J_2$ Heisenberg model was previously determined to be continuous. We determine the location of the tri-critical point in the phase diagram at which first-order transition turns to continuous. Our generalized Shastry-Sutherland model provides not only a valuable platform to explore exotic phases and phase transitions but also more realistic description of Shastry-Sutherland materials like SrCu$_2$(BO$_3$)$_2$.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17452'&gt;arXiv:2411.17452&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 26 Nov 2024 14:12:00 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

We observe an optimal mixing Hamiltonian strength and analyze the scaling of the total evolution time with the size of the system. We also explore extensions of the circuit, including the use of time-dependent Hamiltonians and reverse digitized annealing. Additionally, we propose that classical, approximate quantum simulators can be used for the proposal step instead of the original real-hardware implementation. We observe that tensor-network simulators, even with unconverged settings, can maintain a scaling advantage over standard classical samplers. This may extend the utility of quantum-enhanced Monte Carlo as a quantum-inspired algorithm, even before the deployment of large-scale quantum hardware.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17821'&gt;arXiv:2411.17821&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 26 Nov 2024 19:02:21 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Singularity with and without disorder at AKLT points</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Loïc Herviou, Anthony Rey, Frédéric Mila&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki (AKLT) point of the bilinear-biquadratic spin-1 chain is a cornerstone example of a disorder point where short-range correlations become incommensurate, and correlation lengths and momenta are non-analytic. While the presence of singularities appears to be generic for AKLT points, we show that for a family of SU(N) models, the AKLT point is not a disorder point: It occurs entirely within an incommensurate phase yet the wave vector remains singular on both sides of the AKLT point. We conjecture that this new possibility is generic for models where the representation is not self-conjugate and the transfer matrix non-Hermitian, while for self-conjugate representations the AKLT points remain disorder points.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17848'&gt;arXiv:2411.17848&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 26 Nov 2024 20:05:18 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Frederic Bippus, Benedikt Schneider, Björn Sbierski&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The numerical study of high-dimensional frustrated quantum magnets remains a challenging problem. Here we present an extension of the pseudo-Majorana functional renormalization group to spin-1/2 XXZ type Hamiltonians with field or magnetization along spin-Z direction at finite temperature. We consider a $U(1)$ symmetry-adapted fermionic spin representation and derive the diagrammatic framework and its renormalization group flow equations. We discuss benchmark results and application to two anti-ferromagnetic triangular lattice materials recently studied in experiments with applied magnetic fields: First, we numerically reproduce the magnetization data measured for CeMgAl$_{11}$O$_{19}$ confirming model parameters previously estimated from inelastic neutron spectrum in high fields. Second, we showcase the accuracy of our method by studying the thermal phase transition into the spin solid up-up-down phase of Na$_2$BaCo(PO$_4$)$_2$ in good agreement with experiment.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18198'&gt;arXiv:2411.18198&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 27 Nov 2024 10:18:11 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Effective temperature in approximate quantum many-body states</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Yu-Qin Chen, Shi-Xin Zhang&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; In the pursuit of numerically identifying the ground state of quantum many-body systems, approximate quantum wavefunction ansatzes are commonly employed. This study focuses on the spectral decomposition of these approximate quantum many-body states into exact eigenstates of the target Hamiltonian. The energy spectral decomposition could reflect the intricate physics at the interplay between quantum systems and numerical algorithms. Here we examine various parameterized wavefunction ansatzes constructed from neural networks, tensor networks, and quantum circuits, employing differentiable programming to numerically approximate ground states and imaginary-time evolved states. Our findings reveal a consistent exponential decay pattern in the spectral contributions of approximate quantum states across different ansatzes, optimization objectives, and quantum systems, characterized by small decay rates denoted as inverse effective temperatures. The effective temperature is related to ansatz expressiveness and accuracy and shows phase transition behaviors in learning imaginary-time evolved states. The universal picture and unique features suggest the significance and potential of the effective temperature in characterizing approximate quantum states.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18921'&gt;arXiv:2411.18921&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 28 Nov 2024 05:23:05 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Strong coupling impurity solver based on quantics tensor cross interpolation</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Aaram J. Kim, Philipp Werner&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Numerical methods capable of handling nonequilibrium impurity models are essential for the study of transport problems and the solution of the nonequilibrium dynamical mean field theory (DMFT) equations. In the strong correlation regime, the self-consistently resummed hybridization expansion is an appealing strategy, which however has been employed so far mainly in the lowest-order noncrossing approximation. At higher orders, standard implementations become numerically costly, but a significant speed-up can be achieved by evaluating multidimensional integrals in an approximate factorized form. Here we develop a one-crossing approximation solver based on the recently introduced quantics tensor cross interpolation, and demonstrate its accuracy and efficiency with applications to the Anderson impurity model and nonequilibrium steady-state DMFT calculations for the Hubbard model.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19026'&gt;arXiv:2411.19026&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 28 Nov 2024 10:01:04 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Competing pair density wave orders in the square lattice $t$-$J$ model</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Wayne Zheng, Zheng-Yuan Yue, Jian-Hao Zhang, Zheng-Cheng Gu&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Over the last two decades, the competing orders in high-$T_{c}$ cuprates have been intensely studied, such as pseudogap phase, charge density waves (CDW), and pair density waves (PDW), which are thought to play a crucial role in high-temperature superconductivity. Using the $t$-$J$ model on a square lattice as the simplest model for high-$T_{c}$ cuprates, we employed the fermionic tensor product state (fTPS) method for numerical investigations. Our study revealed new types of PDW states alongside the well-known $d$-wave state and the recently discovered fluctuating PDW state within the low-energy subspace of the $t$-$J$ model. We believe that the competition among these states in the underdoped region suggests the potential existence of a fluctuating quantum liquid of PDW states, providing direct evidence for the pseudogap phase's "cheap vortex" scenario. Furthermore, we discuss the potential experimental implication of our discovery.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19218'&gt;arXiv:2411.19218&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 28 Nov 2024 15:40:03 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

Additionally, the momentum of one-particle state and two-particle state whose total momentum is zero are classified using matrix elements of proper momentum operators. Furthermore, using Lüscher's formula, the scattering phase shift is also computed from the energy of two-particle state.

      <title>Learning Feedback Mechanisms for Measurement-Based Variational Quantum State Preparation</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19914</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Daniel Alcalde Puente, Matteo Rizzi&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; This work introduces a self-learning protocol that incorporates measurement and feedback into variational quantum circuits for efficient quantum state preparation. By combining projective measurements with conditional feedback, the protocol learns state preparation strategies that extend beyond unitary-only methods, leveraging measurement-based shortcuts to reduce circuit depth. Using the spin-1 Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki state as a benchmark, the protocol learns high-fidelity state preparation by overcoming a family of measurement induced local minima through adjustments of parameter update frequencies and ancilla regularization. Despite these efforts, optimization remains challenging due to the highly non-convex landscapes inherent to variational circuits. The approach is extended to larger systems using translationally invariant ansätze and recurrent neural networks for feedback, demonstrating scalability. Additionally, the successful preparation of a specific AKLT state with desired edge modes highlights the potential to discover new state preparation protocols where none currently exist. These results indicate that integrating measurement and feedback into variational quantum algorithms provides a promising framework for quantum state preparation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19914'&gt;arXiv:2411.19914&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 29 Nov 2024 18:21:51 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Quantum entanglement entropy and Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid to liquid transition in biquadratic spin-1 XY chain with rhombic single-ion anisotropy</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00739</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Yan-Wei Dai, Yao Heng Su, Sam Young Cho, Huan-Qiang Zhou&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Quantum phase transitions (QPTs) are investigated in biquadratic spin-$1$ XY chain with rhombic single-ion anisotropy by using the ground state energy (GE), the bipartite entanglement entropy (BEE), and the mutual information (MI). It turns out that there are three spin nematic phases and two Tomonaga-Luttinger (TL) liquid phases with the central charge $c = 1$. The TL Liquid phases emerge roughly for biquadratic interaction strength two times stronger than the absolute value of the single-ion anisotropy. The GE and the derivatives up to the second order reveal a first-order QPT between spin nematic ferroquarupole (FQ) phases but cannot capture an evident signal of QPTs between the spin nematic phases and the TL Liquid phases as well as QPT between the two TL liquid phases. The TL liquid-to-liquid transition point features a highly degenerate state and the spin-block entanglement entropy increases logarithmically with block size. The BEE exhibits a divergent or convergent behavior identifying the TL Liquid or spin nematic FQ phases, respectively. Similarly, the MI and the spin-spin correlation are shown to decay algebraically or exponentially with increasing the lattice distance in the TL Liquid or spin nematic FQ phases, respectively. In the TL liquid phase, the exponents $\eta_I$ and $\eta_z$ of the MI and the spin-spin correlation vary with the interaction parameter of the biquadratic interaction strength and the rhombic single-ion anisotropy and satisfy the relationship of $\eta_z &lt;\eta_I$. Such changes of characteristic behavior of the BEE, the MI and the spin-spin correlation indicate an occurrence of the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT)-type QPT between the TL Liquid phase and the spin nematic FQ phase. The staggered spin fluctuation $\langle S^x S^y \rangle$ is shown to play a significant role for the emergence of the TL liquid phase and thus give rise to the BKT-type QPT.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00739'&gt;arXiv:2412.00739&lt;/a&gt;] Published Sun, 01 Dec 2024 09:16:58 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Quantum simulation of the phase transition of the massive Thirring model</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Jia-Qi Gong, Ji-Chong Yang&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The rapid development of quantum computing technology has made it possible to study the thermodynamic properties of fermionic systems at finite temperatures through quantum simulations on a quantum computer. This provides a novel approach to the study of the chiral phase transition of fermionic systems. Among these, the quantum minimally entangled typical thermal states (QMETTS) algorithm has recently attracted considerable interest. The massive Thirring model, which exhibits a variety of phenomena at low temperatures, includes both a chiral phase transition and a topologically non-trivial ground state. It therefore raises the intriguing question of whether its phase transition can be studied using a quantum simulation approach. In this study, the chiral phase transition of the massive Thirring model and its dual topological phase transition are studied using the QMETTS algorithm. The results show that QMETTS is able to accurately reproduce the phase transition and thermodynamic properties of the massive Thirring model.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00803'&gt;arXiv:2412.00803&lt;/a&gt;] Published Sun, 01 Dec 2024 13:10:16 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

To reduce the memory and computational footprint, dynamical low-rank approximation (DLRA) has proven to be a promising approach. DLRA represents the solution as a low-rank tensor factorization and evolves the resulting low-rank factors in time. A central challenge in DLRA is to find time integration schemes that are robust to the arising small singular values. A robust parallel basis update &amp; Galerkin integrator, which simultaneously evolves all low-rank factors, has recently been derived for matrix differential equations. This work extends the parallel low-rank matrix integrator to Tucker tensors and general tree tensor networks, yielding an algorithm in which all bases and connecting tensors are evolved in parallel over a time step. We formulate the algorithm, provide a robust error bound, and demonstrate the efficiency of the new integrators for problems in quantum many-body physics, uncertainty quantification, and radiative transfer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00858'&gt;arXiv:2412.00858&lt;/a&gt;] Published Sun, 01 Dec 2024 15:45:48 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Fractal decompositions and tensor network representations of Bethe wavefunctions</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00923</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Subhayan Sahu, Guifre Vidal&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We investigate the entanglement structure of a generic $M$-particle Bethe wavefunction (not necessarily an eigenstate of an integrable model) on a 1d lattice by dividing the lattice into $L$ parts and decomposing the wavefunction into a sum of products of $L$ local wavefunctions. Using the fact that a Bethe wavefunction accepts a \textit{fractal} multipartite decomposition -- it can always be written as a linear combination of $L^M$ products of $L$ local wavefunctions, where each local wavefunction is in turn also a Bethe wavefunction -- we then build \textit{exact, analytical} tensor network representations with finite bond dimension $\chi=2^M$, for a generic planar tree tensor network (TTN), which includes a matrix product states (MPS) and a regular binary TTN as prominent particular cases. For a regular binary tree, the network has depth $\log_{2}(N/M)$ and can be transformed into an adaptive quantum circuit of the same depth, composed of unitary gates acting on $2^M$-dimensional qudits and mid-circuit measurements, that deterministically prepares the Bethe wavefunction. Finally, we put forward a much larger class of \textit{generalized} Bethe wavefunctions, for which the above decompositions, tensor network and quantum circuit representations are also possible.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00923'&gt;arXiv:2412.00923&lt;/a&gt;] Published Sun, 01 Dec 2024 18:13:56 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Anomalous enhancement of Neel order in the $S = 1/2$ square lattice Heisenberg model under fictitious magnetic field</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01435</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Takayuki Yokoyama, Yasuhiro Tada&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Fictitious magnetic fields can be introduced in quantum magnets by the strain engineering and the Aharonov-Casher effect. Here, we study impacts of a uniform fictitious magnetic field and corresponding Landau quantization on the Neel order in the $S=1/2$ Heisenberg model on the square lattice as a prototypical system of quantum magnets. We first analyze the system by using the spin-wave approximation. It is found that the staggered magnetization is enhanced by the fictitious magnetic field and it shows a simple scaling behavior with respect to the magnetic length, in contrast to a naive expectation based on the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. We also perform density matrix renormalization group calculations to fully take quantum effects into account and obtain quantitatively more accurate results. The enhancement is found to be anomalously strong and it shows a non-trivial scaling behavior or a fluctuation induced discontinuity. These results are beyond the well known understanding of correlated systems under magnetic fields called the magnetic catalysis.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01435'&gt;arXiv:2412.01435&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 02 Dec 2024 12:18:15 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Gauging a superposition of fermionic Gaussian projected entangled pair states to get lattice gauge theory eigenstates</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01737</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Gertian Roose, Erez Zohar&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Gauged fermionic projected entangled pair states (GFPEPS) and their Gaussian counterpart (GGFPEPS) are a novel type of lattice gauge theory Ansatz state that combine ideas from the Monte Carlo and tensor network communities. In particular, computation of observables for such states boils down to a Monte Carlo integration over possible gauge field configurations that have probabilities dictated by a fermionic tensor network contraction that accounts for the matter in that background configuration. Crucially, this probability distribution is positive definite and real so that there is no sign problem. When the underlying PEPS is Gaussian, tensor network contraction can be done efficiently, and in this scenario the Ansatz has been tested well numerically. In this work we propose to gauge superpositions of Gaussian PEPS and demonstrate that one can still efficiently compute observables when few Gaussians are in the superposition. As we will argue, the latter is exactly the case for bound states on top of the strongly interacting LGT vacuum, which makes this Ansatz particularly suitable for that scenario. As a corollary, we will provide an exact representation of the LGT ground state as a gauged PEPS.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01737'&gt;arXiv:2412.01737&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 02 Dec 2024 17:31:20 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Edge modes and boundary impurities in the anisotropic Heisenberg spin chain</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00194</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Pradip Kattel, Parameshwar R. Pasnoori, J. H. Pixley, Natan Andrei&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We present a comprehensive analysis of boundary phenomena in a spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ anisotropic Heisenberg chain (XXZ-$\frac{1}{2}$) in the gapped antiferromagnetic phase, with a particular focus on the interplay between fractionalized spin-$\frac{1}{4} $ edge modes and a coupled spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ impurity at the edge. Employing a combination of Bethe Ansatz, exact diagonalization, and density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) methods, we explore the intricate phase diagram that emerges when the impurity is coupled either integrably or non-integrably to the chain. For integrable antiferromagnetic impurity couplings, we identify two distinct phases: the Kondo phase, where the impurity is screened by a multiparticle Kondo effect, and the antiferromagnetic bound mode phase, where an exponentially localized bound state screens the impurity in the ground state. When coupled ferromagnetically while maintaining integrability, the impurity behaves as a free spin-$\frac{1}{2}$, leading to either a ferromagnetic bound mode phase, where the impurity remains free in the ground state but may be screened at higher energy excitations or an unscreened (or local moment) phase where impurity remains unscreened in every eigenstate whereas for non-integrable ferromagnetic coupling, the impurity is not free. In the case of non-integrable antiferromagnetic coupling, a third phase emerges, characterized by mid-gap excitations with two degenerate states below the mass gap on top of the Kondo and antiferromagnetic bound mode phases, further enriching the phase diagram. Our findings highlight the nuanced behavior of boundary impurities in gapped antiferromagnetic systems, offering new insights into Kondo effects and impurity screening in the presence of fractionalized edge modes and bulk antiferromagnetic order.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00194'&gt;arXiv:2412.00194&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 29 Nov 2024 19:00:06 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Accuracy of time-dependent GGE under weak dissipation</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Luca Lumia, Gianni Aupetit-Diallo, Jérôme Dubail, Mario Collura&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Unitary integrable models typically relax to a stationary Generalized Gibbs Ensemble (GGE), but in experimental realizations dissipation often breaks integrability. In this work, we use the recently introduced time-dependent GGE (t-GGE) approach to describe the open dynamics of a gas of bosons subject to atom losses and gains. We employ tensor network methods to provide numerical evidence of the exactness of the t-GGE in the limit of adiabatic dissipation, and of its accuracy in the regime of weak but finite dissipation. That accuracy is tested for two-point functions via the rapidity distribution, and for more complicated correlations through a non-Gaussianity measure. We combine this description with Generalized Hydrodynamics and we show that it correctly captures transport at the Euler scale. Our results demonstrate that the t-GGE approach is robust in both homogeneous and inhomogeneous settings.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01896'&gt;arXiv:2412.01896&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 02 Dec 2024 19:00:02 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

Using the Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) approach, we efficiently compute the spectrum of the Schwinger model on a staggered lattice with up to 3000 qubits. As a result, we achieve a precise computation of the critical mass of the massive Schwinger model to five digits using four different 'criticality criteria', observing perfect agreement among them. Additionally, we discuss the effect of a four-fermion operator deformation of the Schwinger model and compute the critical mass for various values of the deformation parameter.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01902'&gt;arXiv:2412.01902&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 02 Dec 2024 19:00:11 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Markov Chain Monte Carlo in Tensor Network Representation</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Synge Todo&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) is a powerful tool for sampling from complex probability distributions. Despite its versatility, MCMC often suffers from strong autocorrelation and the negative sign problem, leading to slowing down the convergence of statistical error. We propose a novel MCMC formulation based on tensor network representations to reduce the population variance and mitigate these issues systematically. By introducing stochastic projectors into the tensor network framework and employing Markov chain sampling, our method eliminates the systematic error associated with low-rank approximation in tensor contraction while maintaining the high accuracy of the tensor network method. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method on the two-dimensional Ising model, achieving an exponential reduction in statistical error with increasing bond dimension cutoff. Furthermore, we address the sign problem in systems with negative weights, showing significant improvements in average signs as bond dimension cutoff increases. The proposed framework provides a robust solution for accurate statistical estimation in complex systems, paving the way for broader applications in computational physics and beyond.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02974'&gt;arXiv:2412.02974&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 04 Dec 2024 02:36:33 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Tensor renormalization group study of (1+1)-dimensional O(3) nonlinear sigma model with and without finite chemical potential</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02995</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Xiao Luo, Yoshinobu Kuramashi&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We study (1+1)-dimensional O(3) nonlinear sigma model using the tensor renormalization group method with the infinite limit of the bond dimension $D_{\rm cut}\rightarrow \infty$. At the vanishing chemical potential $\mu=0$, we investigate the von Neumann and Rényi types of entanglement entropies. The central charge is determined to be $c=1.97(9)$ by using the asymptotic scaling properties of the entropies. We also examine the consistency between two entropies. In the finite density region with $\mu\ne 0$, where this model suffers from the sign problem in the standard Monte Carlo approach, we investigate the properties of the quantum phase transition. We determine the transition point $\mu_{\rm c}$ and the critical exponent of the correlation length $\nu$ from the $\mu$ dependence of the number density in the thermodynamic limit. The dynamical critical exponent $z$ is also extracted from the scaling behavior of the temporal correlation length as a function of $\mu$. This is the first successful calculation of the dynamical critical exponent with the TRG method.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02995'&gt;arXiv:2412.02995&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 04 Dec 2024 03:21:36 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

We provide numerical simulations illustrating the main features of the methods and showing convergence with respect to some parameter, such as the rank for DMRG, and number of pretraining iterations for neural networks. We then compare the obtained energy with the methods for a few atoms and molecules, for some of which the exact value of the energy is known for the sake of comparison. In the last part of the article, we propose a new kind of neural network to solve the Schr{ö}dinger problem based on the training of the wavefunction on a simplex, and an explicit permutation for evaluating the wavefunction on the whole space. We provide numerical results on a toy problem for the sake of illustration.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03319'&gt;arXiv:2412.03319&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 04 Dec 2024 13:52:49 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

Both the continuum and lattice versions of the Schwinger model with $\theta=\pi$ are known to exhibit first-order phase transitions for the values of the fermion mass above a critical value, where a second-order phase transition occurs. Our algorithm enables a precise determination of the critical endpoint in the continuum theory. We further analyze the scaling in the simultaneous critical and continuum limits and confirm that the data collapse aligns with the Ising universality class to remarkable precision.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03569'&gt;arXiv:2412.03569&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 04 Dec 2024 18:59:18 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

X-ray photon correlation spectroscopy (XPCS) with coherent X-ray sources offers access to higher-order correlations, but its theoretical basis, the Siegert relation, is derived from dynamical light scattering with independent classical scatterers, and its validity for XPCS remains unexamined. Here we present a microscopic quantum theory of XPCS derived from elecron-photon interaction Hamiltonians, introducing four configurations tied to distinct fourth-order electron-density correlation functions. We examine the validity of the Siegert relation and derive a generalized Siegert relation. Notably, the Siegert relation breaks down even in non-interacting Fermi gas due to exchange interactions. Furthermore, density matrix renormalization group calculations on 1D Kitaev chain reveal oscillatary signatures that can distinguish topologically trivial phases from topological phases with Majorana zero modes. Our work provides a robust theoretical foundation for XPCS and highlights the value of higher-order correlations in advanced X-ray and neutron sources for probing quantum materials.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03635'&gt;arXiv:2412.03635&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 04 Dec 2024 19:00:00 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Quench dynamics of entanglement from crosscap states</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Konstantinos Chalas, Pasquale Calabrese, Colin Rylands&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The linear growth of entanglement after a quench from a state with short-range correlations is a universal feature of many body dynamics. It has been shown to occur in integrable and chaotic systems undergoing either Hamiltonian, Floquet or circuit dynamics and has also been observed in experiments. The entanglement dynamics emerging from long-range correlated states is far less studied, although no less viable using modern quantum simulation experiments. In this work, we investigate the dynamics of the bipartite entanglement entropy and mutual information from initial states which have long-range entanglement with correlation between antipodal points of a finite and periodic system. Starting from these crosscap states, we study both brickwork quantum circuits and Hamiltonian dynamics and find distinct patterns of behaviour depending on the type of dynamics and whether the system is integrable or chaotic. Specifically, we study both dual unitary and random unitary quantum circuits as well as free and interacting fermion Hamiltonians. For integrable systems, we find that after a time delay the entanglement experiences a linear in time decrease followed by a series of revivals, while, in contrast, chaotic systems exhibit constant entanglement entropy. On the other hand, both types of systems experience an immediate linear decrease of the mutual information in time. In chaotic systems this then vanishes, whereas integrable systems instead experience a series of revivals. We show how the quasiparticle and membrane pictures of entanglement dynamics can be modified to describe this behaviour, and derive explicitly the quasiparticle picture in the case of free fermion models which we then extend to all integrable systems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04187'&gt;arXiv:2412.04187&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 05 Dec 2024 14:27:13 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Carolin Wille, Maksimilian Usoltcev, Jens Eisert, Alexander Altland&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; This work proposes a minimal model extending the duality between classical statistical spin systems and fermionic systems beyond the case of free fermions. A Jordan-Wigner transformation applied to a two-dimensional tensor network maps the partition sum of a classical statistical mechanics model to a Grassmann variable integral, structurally similar to the path integral for interacting fermions in two dimensions. The resulting model is simple, featuring only two parameters: one governing spin-spin interaction (dual to effective hopping strength in the fermionic picture), the other measuring the deviation from the free fermion limit. Nevertheless, it exhibits a rich phase diagram, partially stabilized by elements of topology, and featuring three phases meeting at a tricritical point. Besides the interpretation as a spin and fermionic system, the model is closely related to loop gas and vertex models and can be interpreted as a parity-preserving (non-unitary) circuit. Its minimal construction makes it an ideal reference system for studying non-linearities in tensor networks and deriving results by means of duality.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04216'&gt;arXiv:2412.04216&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 05 Dec 2024 14:49:39 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Spinon Singlet in Quantum Colored String: Origin of $d$-Wave Pairing in a Partially-Filled Stripe</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04379</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Jia-Long Wang, Shi-Jie Hu, Xue-Feng Zhang&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Although both experimental observations and numerical simulations have reached a consensus that the stripe phase is intertwined with superconductivity in cuprates, the microscopic mechanism behind $d$-wave pairing in the presence of stripes remains unclear. Using the effective theory of quantum colored strings, we derive the wavefunction in Fock space. Our results show that two spinons with opposite chiralities tend to pair into a spinon singlet, which in turn facilitates the formation of negative pair-pair correlations between distant $x$-bonds and $y$-bonds, a hallmark of the $d$-wave pairing pattern. The same pair-pair correlation pattern is observed across various models, as confirmed by large-scale density matrix renormalization group calculations. Based on these results, we conclude that the spinon singlet is the origin of $d$-wave superconductivity in a fluctuating, partially-filled stripe, and this mechanism may also extend to multi-stripe configurations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04379'&gt;arXiv:2412.04379&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 05 Dec 2024 17:54:33 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Spin dynamics of an easy-plane Dirac spin liquid in a frustrated XY model: Application to honeycomb cobaltates</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04544</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Anjishnu Bose, Arun Paramekanti&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Recent work has shown that the honeycomb lattice spin-$1/2$ $J_1$-$J_3$ XY model, with nearest-neighbor ferromagnetic exchange $J_1$ and frustration induced by third-neighbor antiferromagnetic exchange $J_3$, may be relevant to a wide range of cobaltate materials. We explore a variational Monte Carlo study of Gutzwiller projected wavefunctions for this model and show that an easy-plane Dirac spin liquid (DSL) is a viable `parent' state for the competing magnetic orders observed in these materials, including ferromagnetic, zig-zag, spiral, and double zig-zag orders at intermediate frustration, and show that such broken symmetry states can be easily polarized by a weak in-plane magnetic field consistent with experiments. We formulate a modified parton theory for such frustrated spin models, and explore the potential instabilities of the DSL due to residual parton interactions within a random phase approximation (RPA), both at zero magnetic field and in a nonzero in-plane field. The broken symmetry states which emerge in the vicinity of this Dirac spin liquid include ferromagnetic, zig-zag, and incommensurate spiral orders, with a phase diagram which is consistent with VMC and density matrix renormalization group studies. We calculate the dynamical spin response of the easy-plane DSL, including RPA corrections, near the boundary of the ordered states, and present results for THz spectroscopy and inelastic neutron scattering, at zero field as well as in an in-plane magnetic field, and discuss experimental implications.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04544'&gt;arXiv:2412.04544&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 05 Dec 2024 19:00:01 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Cost optimized ab initio tensor network state methods: industrial perspectives</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04676</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Andor Menczer, Örs Legeza&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We introduce efficient solutions to optimize the cost of tree-like tensor network state method calculations when an expensive GPU-accelerated hardware is utilized. By supporting a main powerful compute node with additional auxiliary, but much cheaper nodes to store intermediate, precontracted tensor network scratch data, the IO time can be hidden behind the computation almost entirely without increasing memory peak. Our solution is based on the different bandwidths of the different communication channels, like NVLink, PCIe, InfiniBand and available storage media, which are utilized on different layers of the algorithm. This simple heterogeneous multiNode solution via asynchronous IO operation has the potential to minimize IO overhead, resulting in maximum performance rate for the main compute unit. In addition, we introduce an in-house developed massively parallel protocol to serialize and deserialize block sparse matrices and tensors, reducing data communication time tremendously. Performance profiles are presented for the spin adapted ab initio density matrix renormalization group method for corresponding U(1) bond dimension values up to 15400 on the active compounds of the FeMoco with complete active space (CAS) sizes of up to 113 electrons in 76 orbitals [CAS(113, 76)].&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04676'&gt;arXiv:2412.04676&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 06 Dec 2024 00:01:01 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Infinite Grassmann time-evolving matrix product operators for quantum impurity problems after a quench</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04702</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Zhijie Sun, Ruofan Chen, Zhenyu Li, Chu Guo&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; An emergent numerical approach to solve quantum impurity problems is to encode the impurity path integral as a matrix product state. For time-dependent problems, the cost of this approach generally scales with the evolution time. Here we consider a common non-equilibrium scenario where an impurity, initially in equilibrium with a thermal bath, is driven out of equilibrium by a sudden quench of the impurity Hamiltonian. Despite that there is no time-translational invariance in the problem, we show that we could still make full use of the infinite matrix product state technique, resulting in a method whose cost is essentially independent of the evolution time. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method in the integrable case against exact diagonalization, and against existing calculations on the L-shaped Kadanoff-Baym contour in the general case. Our method could be a very competitive method for studying long-time non-equilibrium quantum dynamics, and be potentially used as an efficient impurity solver in the non-equilibrium dynamical mean field theory.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04702'&gt;arXiv:2412.04702&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 06 Dec 2024 01:28:30 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Entanglement scaling in matrix product state representation of smooth functions and their shallow quantum circuit approximations</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05202</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Vladyslav Bohun, Illia Lukin, Mykola Luhanko, Georgios Korpas, Philippe J. S. De Brouwer, Mykola Maksymenko, Maciej Koch-Janusz&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Encoding classical data in a quantum state is a key prerequisite of many quantum algorithms. Recently matrix product state (MPS) methods emerged as the most promising approach for constructing shallow quantum circuits approximating input functions, including probability distributions, with only linear number of gates. We derive rigorous asymptotic expansions for the decay of entanglement across bonds in the MPS representation depending on the smoothness of the input function, real or complex. We also consider the dependence of the entanglement on localization properties and function support. Based on these analytical results we construct an improved MPS-based algorithm yielding shallow and accurate encoding quantum circuits. By using Tensor Cross Interpolation we are able to construct utility-scale quantum circuits in a compute- and memory-efficient way. We validate our methods on heavy-tailed distributions important in finance, including on Lévy distributions. We test the performance of the resulting quantum circuits by executing and sampling from them on IBM quantum devices, for up to 64 qubits.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05202'&gt;arXiv:2412.05202&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 06 Dec 2024 17:31:35 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Quantum Annealing and Tensor Networks: a Powerful Combination to Solve Optimization Problems</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05595</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Miquel Albertí Binimelis&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Quantum computing has long promised to revolutionize the way we solve complex problems. At the same time, tensor networks are widely used across various fields due to their computational efficiency and capacity to represent intricate systems. While both technologies can address similar problems, the primary aim of this thesis is not to compare them. Such comparison would be unfair, as quantum devices are still in an early stage, whereas tensor network algorithms represent the state-of-the-art in quantum simulation. Instead, we explore a potential synergy between these technologies, focusing on how two flagship algorithms from each paradigm, the Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) and quantum annealing, might collaborate in the future. Furthermore, a significant challenge in the DMRG algorithm is identifying an appropriate tensor network representation for the quantum system under study. The representation commonly used is called Matrix Product Operator (MPO), and it is notoriously difficult to obtain for certain systems. This thesis outlines an approach to this problem using finite automata, which we apply to construct the MPO for our case study. Finally, we present a practical application of this framework through the quadratic knapsack problem (QKP). Despite its apparent simplicity, the QKP is a fundamental problem in computer science with numerous practical applications. In addition to quantum annealing and the DMRG algorithm, we implement a dynamic programming approach to evaluate the quality of our results. Our results highlight the power of tensor networks and the potential of quantum annealing for solving optimization problems. Moreover, this thesis is designed to be self-explanatory, ensuring that readers with a solid mathematical background can fully understand the content without prior knowledge of quantum mechanics.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05595'&gt;arXiv:2412.05595&lt;/a&gt;] Published Sat, 07 Dec 2024 09:20:20 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>No-Free-Lunch Theories for Tensor-Network Machine Learning Models</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05674</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Jing-Chuan Wu, Qi Ye, Dong-Ling Deng, Li-Wei Yu&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Tensor network machine learning models have shown remarkable versatility in tackling complex data-driven tasks, ranging from quantum many-body problems to classical pattern recognitions. Despite their promising performance, a comprehensive understanding of the underlying assumptions and limitations of these models is still lacking. In this work, we focus on the rigorous formulation of their no-free-lunch theorem -- essential yet notoriously challenging to formalize for specific tensor network machine learning models. In particular, we rigorously analyze the generalization risks of learning target output functions from input data encoded in tensor network states. We first prove a no-free-lunch theorem for machine learning models based on matrix product states, i.e., the one-dimensional tensor network states. Furthermore, we circumvent the challenging issue of calculating the partition function for two-dimensional Ising model, and prove the no-free-lunch theorem for the case of two-dimensional projected entangled-pair state, by introducing the combinatorial method associated to the "puzzle of polyominoes". Our findings reveal the intrinsic limitations of tensor network-based learning models in a rigorous fashion, and open up an avenue for future analytical exploration of both the strengths and limitations of quantum-inspired machine learning frameworks.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05674'&gt;arXiv:2412.05674&lt;/a&gt;] Published Sat, 07 Dec 2024 14:41:24 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>A review of low-rank methods for time-dependent kinetic simulations</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05912</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Lukas Einkemmer, Katharina Kormann, Jonas Kusch, Ryan G. McClarren, Jing-Mei Qiu&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Time-dependent kinetic models are ubiquitous in computational science and engineering. The underlying integro-differential equations in these models are high-dimensional, comprised of a six--dimensional phase space, making simulations of such phenomena extremely expensive. In this article we demonstrate that in many situations, the solution to kinetics problems lives on a low dimensional manifold that can be described by a low-rank matrix or tensor approximation. We then review the recent development of so-called low-rank methods that evolve the solution on this manifold. The two classes of methods we review are the dynamical low-rank (DLR) method, which derives differential equations for the low-rank factors, and a Step-and-Truncate (SAT) approach, which projects the solution onto the low-rank representation after each time step. Thorough discussions of time integrators, tensor decompositions, and method properties such as structure preservation and computational efficiency are included. We further show examples of low-rank methods as applied to particle transport and plasma dynamics.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05912'&gt;arXiv:2412.05912&lt;/a&gt;] Published Sun, 08 Dec 2024 12:13:16 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Interaction-induced phases in the half-filled Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang model in one dimension</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05975</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Roberta Favata, Davide Piccioni, Alberto Parola, Federico Becca&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We explore the ground-state properties of a one-dimensional model with two orbitals per site, where, in addition to atomic energies $\pm M$, intra- and inter-orbital hoppings, the intra-orbital Hubbard ($U$) and nearest-neighbor density-density ($V$) repulsions are included. Our results are primarily based on a Jastrow-Slater wave function and variational Monte Carlo methods, but also corroborated by density-matrix renormalization group calculations. In the non-interacting limit, when varying $M&gt;0$, a gapless point separates a trivial phase from a topological one. The inclusion of a finite Hubbard-$U$ repulsion does not give rise to any phase transition within the topological region, inducing a smooth crossover into a Haldane (spin gapped) insulator; notably, the string-order parameter, which characterizes the latter phase, is already finite in the non-interacting limit. Most importantly, at finite values of $U$, the transition between the trivial and topological states is not direct, since an emergent insulator, which shows evidence of sustaining gapless spin excitations, intrudes between them. A small $V$ interaction further stabilizes the intermediate insulator, while a sufficiently large value of this nearest-neighbor repulsion gives rise to two different charge-density wave insulators, one fully gapped and another still supporting gapless spin excitations. Our results demonstrate the richness of multi-orbital Hubbard models, in the presence of a topologically non-trivial band structure, and serve as a basis for future investigations on similar two-dimensional models.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05975'&gt;arXiv:2412.05975&lt;/a&gt;] Published Sun, 08 Dec 2024 15:46:55 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Alberto Bucci, Gianfranco Verzella&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; In this work, we present the tree tensor network Nyström (TTNN), an algorithm that extends recent research on streamable tensor approximation, such as for Tucker and tensor-train formats, to the more general tree tensor network format, enabling a unified treatment of various existing methods. Our method retains the key features of the generalized Nyström approximation for matrices, that is randomized, single-pass, streamable, and cost-effective. Additionally, the structure of the sketching allows for parallel implementation. We provide a deterministic error bound for the algorithm and, in the specific case of Gaussian dimension reduction maps, also a probabilistic one. We also introduce a sequential variant of the algorithm, referred to as sequential tree tensor network Nyström (STTNN), which offers better performance for dense tensors. Furthermore, both algorithms are well-suited for the recompression or rounding of tensors in the tree tensor network format. Numerical experiments highlight the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed methods.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06111'&gt;arXiv:2412.06111&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 09 Dec 2024 00:11:01 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Entanglement entropy for a type of scale-invariant states in two spatial dimensions and beyond: universal finite-size scaling</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06396</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Huan-Qiang Zhou, Qian-Qian Shi, Ian P. McCulloch, Murray T. Batchelor&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; A generic scheme is proposed to investigate the entanglement entropy for a type of scale-invariant states, valid for orthonormal basis states in the ground state subspace of quantum many-body systems undergoing spontaneous symmetry breaking with type-B Goldstone modes in two spatial dimensions and beyond. It is argued that a contribution from the area law to the entanglement entropy is absent, since the closeness to the boundary between a subsystem and its environment is not well-defined, given that a permutation symmetry group with respect to the unit cells of degenerate ground state wave functions emerges. Three physical constraints imposed lead to a universal finite-system size scaling function in the dominant logarithmic contribution to the entanglement entropy. As a result, an abstract fractal underlying the ground state subspace is revealed, characterized by the fractal dimension. The latter in turn is identical to the number of type-B Goldstone modes for the orthonormal basis states. The prediction is numerically confirmed for the ${\rm SU}(2)$ spin-$s$ ferromagnetic Heisenberg model, the ${\rm SU}(2s+1)$ ferromagnetic model, and the staggered ${\rm SU}(3)$ spin-1 ferromagnetic biquadratic model.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06396'&gt;arXiv:2412.06396&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 09 Dec 2024 11:25:31 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Tube Category, Tensor Renormalization and Topological Holography</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07198</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Tian Lan&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Ocneanu's tube algebra provides a finite algorithm to compute the Drinfeld center of a fusion category. In this work we reveal the universal property underlying the tube algebra. Take a base category $\mathcal V$ which is strongly concrete, bicomplete, and closed symmetric monoidal. For physical applications one takes $\mathcal V=\mathbf{Vect}$ the category of vector spaces. Given a $\mathcal V$-enriched rigid monoidal category $\mathcal C$ (not necessarily finite or semisimple) we define the tube category $\mathbb X \mathcal C$ using coends valued in $\mathcal V$. Our main theorem established the relation between (the category of representations of) the tube category $\mathbb X \mathcal C$ and the Drinfeld center $Z(\mathcal C)$: $Z(\mathcal C)\hookrightarrow \mathrm{Fun}(\mathbb X \mathcal C^{\mathrm{op}},\mathcal V)\cong Z(\mathcal C\hookrightarrow\mathrm{Fun}(\mathcal C^{\mathrm{op}},\mathcal V))\hookrightarrow Z(\mathrm{Fun}(\mathcal C^{\mathrm{op}},\mathcal V))$. Physically, besides viewing the tube category as a version of TFT with domain being the tube, we emphasize the "Wick-rotated" perspective, that the morphisms in $\mathbb X \mathcal C$ are the local tensors of fixed-point matrix product operators which preserves the symmetry $\mathcal C$ in one spatial dimension. We provide a first-principle flavored construction, from microscopic quantum degrees of freedom and operators preserving the symmetry, to the macroscopic universal properties of the symmetry which form the Drinfeld center. Our work is thus a proof to the 1+1D topological holography in a very general setting.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07198'&gt;arXiv:2412.07198&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 10 Dec 2024 05:25:04 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>A clustering aggregation algorithm on neutral-atoms and annealing quantum processors</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07558</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Riccardo Scotti, Gabriella Bettonte, Antonio Costantini, Sara Marzella, Daniele Ottaviani, Stefano Lodi&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; This work presents a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm to perform clustering aggregation, designed for neutral-atoms quantum computers and quantum annealers. Clustering aggregation is a technique that mitigates the weaknesses of clustering algorithms, an important class of data science methods for partitioning datasets, and is widely employed in many real-world applications. By expressing the clustering aggregation problem instances as a Maximum Independent Set (MIS) problem and as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problem, it was possible to solve them by leveraging the potential of Pasqal's Fresnel (neutral-atoms processor) and D-Wave's Advantage QPU (quantum annealer). Additionally, the designed clustering aggregation algorithm was first validated on a Fresnel emulator based on QuTiP and later on an emulator of the same machine based on tensor networks, provided by Pasqal. The results revealed technical limitations, such as the difficulty of adding additional constraints on the employed neutral-atoms platform and the need for better metrics to measure the quality of the produced clusterings. However, this work represents a step towards a benchmark to compare two different machines: a quantum annealer and a neutral-atom quantum computer.

      <title>Boundary anomaly detection in two-dimensional subsystem symmetry-protected topological phases</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07563</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Ke Ding, Hao-Ran Zhang, Bai-Ting Liu, Shuo Yang&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We generalize the topological response theory to detect the boundary anomalies of linear subsystem symmetries. This approach allows us to distinguish different subsystem symmetry-protected topological (SSPT) phases and uncover new ones. We focus on the cases where the mixed anomaly exists within the adjacent subsystems. Using numerical simulations, we demonstrate the power of this method by identifying strong and weak $Z_2^\tau\times Z_2^\sigma$ SSPT phases in a tunable tensor network state. Our analysis reveals an intrinsic $Z_2$ SSPT phase characterized by its degenerate entanglement spectrum. Furthermore, we extend the anomaly indicator to mixed-state density matrices and show that quantum anomalies of subsystem symmetry can persist under both uniform and alternating disorders. This finding establishes a connection between boundary quantum anomalies in pure and mixed states. Our work provides a numerical method to detect quantum anomalies of subsystem symmetries, offering new insights into the study of topological quantum phases.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07563'&gt;arXiv:2412.07563&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 10 Dec 2024 14:53:54 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Quantum Chemical Density Matrix Renormalization Group Method Boosted by Machine Learning</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Pavlo Golub, Chao Yang, Vojtěch Vlček, Libor Veis&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Accurate electronic structure calculations are essential in modern materials science, but strongly correlated systems pose a significant challenge due to their computational cost. Traditional methods, such as complete active space self-consistent field (CASSCF), scale exponentially with system size, while alternative methods like the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) scale more favorably, yet remain limited for large systems. In this work, we demonstrate how a simple machine learning model can enhance quantum chemical DMRG calculations, improving their accuracy to chemical precision, even for systems that would otherwise require considerably higher computational resources. The systems under study are polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, which are typical candidates for DMRG calculations and are highly relevant for advanced technological applications.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07607'&gt;arXiv:2412.07607&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 10 Dec 2024 15:46:47 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

It is based on the annealing path commonly used in MCMC literature, which is given by the linear interpolation in the space of energies. Inspired by Sequential Monte Carlo, we alternate between deterministic time steps from the TT representation of the flow field and stochastic steps, which include Langevin and resampling steps. These adjust the relative weights of the different modes of the target distribution and anneal to the correct path distribution. We showcase the efficiency of our method on multiple numerical examples.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07637'&gt;arXiv:2412.07637&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 10 Dec 2024 16:17:03 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Danylo Kolesnyk, Yelyzaveta Vodovozova&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Modern approaches to generative modeling of continuous data using tensor networks incorporate compression layers to capture the most meaningful features of high-dimensional inputs. These methods, however, rely on traditional Matrix Product States (MPS) architectures. Here, we demonstrate that beyond a certain threshold in data and bond dimensions, a comb-shaped tensor network architecture can yield more efficient contractions than a standard MPS. This finding suggests that for continuous and high-dimensional data distributions, transitioning from MPS to a comb tensor network representation can substantially reduce computational overhead while maintaining accuracy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06857'&gt;arXiv:2412.06857&lt;/a&gt;] Published Sun, 08 Dec 2024 20:28:49 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Boundary transitions from a single round of measurements on gapless quantum states</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07830</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Yue Liu, Sara Murciano, David F. Mross, Jason Alicea&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Measurements can qualitatively alter correlations and entanglement emerging in gapless quantum matter. We show how a single round of measurements on gapless quantum systems can, upon rotating the measurement basis, induce non-trivial transitions separating regimes displaying universal characteristics governed by distinct boundary conformal field theories. We develop the theory of such `measurement-induced boundary transitions' by investigating a gapless parent of the one-dimensional cluster state, obtained by appropriately symmetrizing a commuting projector Hamiltonian for the latter. Projective measurements on the cluster state are known to convert the wavefunction, after post-selection or decoding, into a long-range-ordered Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state. Similar measurements applied to the gapless parent (i) generate long-range order coexisting with power-law correlations when post-selecting for uniform outcomes, and (ii) yield power-law correlations distinct from those in the pre-measurement state upon decoding. In the post-selection scenario, rotating the measurement basis preserves long-range order up until a critical tilt angle marking a measurement-induced boundary transition to a power-law-ordered regime. Such a transition -- which does not exist in the descendant cluster state -- establishes new connections between measurement effects on many-body states and non-trivial renormalization-group flows. We extend our analysis to tricritical Ising and three-state Potts critical theories, which also display measurement-induced boundary transitions, and propose general criteria for their existence in other settings.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07830'&gt;arXiv:2412.07830&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 10 Dec 2024 19:00:00 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

The method efficiently computes rigorous upper and lower bounds on both zero- and finite-temperature expectation values of any local observables of infinite quantum spin chains. This is achieved by using tensor networks to coarse-grain bootstrap constraints, including positivity, translation invariance, equations of motion, and energy-entropy balance inequalities. Coarse-graining allows access to constraints from significantly larger subsystems than previously possible, yielding substantially tighter bounds compared to earlier methods.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07837'&gt;arXiv:2412.07837&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 10 Dec 2024 19:00:01 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>On Faster Marginalization with Squared Circuits via Orthonormalization</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07883</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Lorenzo Loconte, Antonio Vergari&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Squared tensor networks (TNs) and their generalization as parameterized computational graphs -- squared circuits -- have been recently used as expressive distribution estimators in high dimensions. However, the squaring operation introduces additional complexity when marginalizing variables or computing the partition function, which hinders their usage in machine learning applications. Canonical forms of popular TNs are parameterized via unitary matrices as to simplify the computation of particular marginals, but cannot be mapped to general circuits since these might not correspond to a known TN. Inspired by TN canonical forms, we show how to parameterize squared circuits to ensure they encode already normalized distributions. We then use this parameterization to devise an algorithm to compute any marginal of squared circuits that is more efficient than a previously known one. We conclude by formally showing the proposed parameterization comes with no expressiveness loss for many circuit classes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07883'&gt;arXiv:2412.07883&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 10 Dec 2024 19:37:03 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Persistent Haldane Phase in Carbon Tetris Chains</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08252</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Anas Abdelwahab, Christoph Karrasch, Roman Rausch&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We introduce the concept of tetris chains, which are linear arrays of 4-site molecules that differ by their intermolecular hopping geometry. We investigate the fermionic symmetry-protected topological Haldane phase in these systems using Hubbard-type models. The topological phase diagrams can be understood via different competing limits and mechanisms: strong-coupling $U\gg t$, weak-coupling $U\ll t$, and the weak intermolecular hopping limit $t'\ll t$. Our particular focus is on two tetris chains that are of experimental relevance. First, we show that a Y-chain of coarse-grained nanographene molecules (triangulenes) is robustly in the Haldane phase in the whole $t'-U$ plane due to the cooperative nature of the three limits. Secondly, we study a near-homogeneous Y$^{\prime}$-chain that is closely related to the electronic model for poly(p-phenylene vinylene). In the latter case, the above mechanisms compete, but the Haldane phase manifests robustly and is stable when long-ranged Pariser-Parr-Popple interactions are added. The site-edged Hubbard ladder can also be viewed as a tetris chain, which gives a very general perspective on the emergence of its fermionic Haldane phase. Our numerical results are obtained by large-scale, SU(2)-symmetric tensor network calculations. We employ the density-matrix-renormalization group as well as the variational uniform matrix-product state (VUMPS) algorithms for finite and infinite systems, respectively. The numerics are supplemented by analytical calculations of the bandstructure winding number.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08252'&gt;arXiv:2412.08252&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 11 Dec 2024 10:04:37 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Simplex tensor network renormalization group for boundary theory of 3+1D symTFT</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08374</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Kaixin Ji, Lin Chen, Li-Ping Yang, Ling-Yan Hung&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Following the construction in arXiv:2210.12127, we develop a symmetry-preserving renormalization group (RG) flow for 3D symmetric theories. These theories are expressed as boundary conditions of a symTFT, which in our case is a 3+1D Dijkgraaf-Witten topological theory in the bulk. The boundary is geometrically organized into tetrahedra and represented as a tensor network, which we refer to as the "simplex tensor network" state. Each simplex tensor is assigned indices corresponding to its vertices, edges, and faces. We propose a numerical algorithm to implement RG flows for these boundary conditions, and explicitly demonstrate its application to a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetric theory. By linearly interpolating between three topological fixed-point boundaries, we map the phase transitions characterized by local and non-local order parameters, which respectively detects the breaking of a 0-form and a 2-form symmetry. This formalism is readily extendable to other discrete symmetry groups and, in principle, can be generalized to describe 3D symmetric topological orders.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08374'&gt;arXiv:2412.08374&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 11 Dec 2024 13:35:57 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Reweighted Time-Evolving Block Decimation for Improved Quantum Dynamics Simulations</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08730</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Sayak Guha Roy, Kevin Slagle&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We introduce a simple yet significant improvement to the time-evolving block decimation (TEBD) tensor network algorithm for simulating the time dynamics of strongly correlated one-dimensional (1D) mixed quantum states. The efficiency of 1D tensor network methods stems from using a product of matrices to express either: the coefficients of a wavefunction, yielding a matrix product state (MPS); or the expectation values of a density matrix, yielding a matrix product density operator (MPDO). To avoid exponential computational costs, TEBD truncates the matrix dimension while simulating the time evolution. However, when truncating a MPDO, TEBD does not favor the likely more important low-weight expectation values, such as $\langle c_i^\dagger c_j \rangle$, over the exponentially many high-weight expectation values, such as $\langle c_{i_1}^\dagger c^\dagger_{i_2} \cdots c_{i_n} \rangle$ of weight $n$, despite the critical importance of the low-weight expectation values. Motivated by this shortcoming, we propose a reweighted TEBD (rTEBD) algorithm that deprioritizes high-weight expectation values by a factor of $\gamma^{-n}$ during the truncation. This simple modification (which only requires reweighting certain matrices by a factor of $\gamma$ in the MPDO) makes rTEBD significantly more accurate than the TEBD time-dependent simulation of an MPDO, and competive with and sometimes better than TEBD using MPS. Furthermore, by prioritizing low-weight expectation values, rTEBD preserves conserved quantities to high precision.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08730'&gt;arXiv:2412.08730&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 11 Dec 2024 19:01:00 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Control Flow Adaption: An Efficient Simulation Method For Noisy Quantum Networks</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Huiping Lin, Ruixuan Deng, Chris Z. Yao, Zhengfeng Ji, Mingsheng Ying&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Quantum network research at both the software stack and hardware implementation level has become an exciting area of quantum information science. Although demonstrations of small-scale quantum networks have emerged in the past decade, quantum communication and computation hardware remain scarce resources today. As a result, the evaluation and validation of quantum network protocols primarily rely on classical simulators rather than real quantum networks. This paper introduces a novel quantum network simulation method called control flow adaptation, which enhances standard tensor network simulations. This method enables accurate and efficient simulations of many important quantum network protocols by carefully leveraging the control flow structures of them. Furthermore, we have developed a prototype quantum network simulator, qns-3, as a module for ns-3. This new module implements the control flow adaptation technique and applies it to a wide range of protocols. All related code is open-sourced. We believe the development of the control flow adaptation method and the qns-3 simulator represents a step forward in quantum network research, offering a versatile and scalable platform for testing and verifying quantum network protocols on classical computers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08956'&gt;arXiv:2412.08956&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 12 Dec 2024 05:37:55 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

The method allows us to deal with the massive staggered fermions straightforwardly and to study the $\theta$ dependence of the free energy and topological charge in the thermodynamic limit. Our calculation provides consistent results with not only the analytical solution in the large mass limit but also the previous Monte Carlo studies in the small mass regime. Our numerical results also suggest that the $N_f=2$ Schwinger model on a lattice has a different phase structure, than the model in the continuum limit.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08959'&gt;arXiv:2412.08959&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 12 Dec 2024 05:44:09 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

Perkins&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We explore the potential experimental realization of the mixed-spin Kitaev model in materials such as Zr$_{0.5}$Ru$_{0.5}$Cl$_3$, where spin-1/2 and spin-3/2 ions occupy distinct sublattices of a honeycomb lattice. By developing a superexchange theory specifically for this mixed-spin system, we identify the conditions under which dominant Kitaev-like interactions emerge. Focusing on the limiting case of pure Kitaev coupling with single-ion anisotropy, we employ a combination of superexchange theory, parton mean-field theory, and density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations. We establish a comprehensive ground-state phase diagram identifying four distinct quantum spin liquid phases. Our findings highlight the importance of spin-orbital couplings and quadrupolar order parameters in stabilizing exotic phases, providing a foundation for exploring mixed-spin Kitaev magnets.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09310'&gt;arXiv:2412.09310&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 12 Dec 2024 14:24:23 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Realization of strongly-interacting Meissner phases in large bosonic flux ladders</title>

Wienand, Immanuel Bloch, Monika Aidelsburger&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Periodically driven quantum systems can realize novel phases of matter that are not present in time-independent Hamiltonians. One important application is the engineering of synthetic gauge fields, which opens the realm of topological many-body physics to neutral atom quantum simulators. In this work, we leverage a neutral atom quantum simulator to experimentally realize the strongly-interacting Mott-Meissner phase in large-scale, bosonic flux ladders with 48 sites at half filling. By combining quantum gas microscopy with local basis rotations, we reveal the emerging equilibrium particle currents with local resolution across large systems. We find chiral currents exhibiting a characteristic interaction scaling, providing direct experimental evidence of the interacting Mott-Meissner phase. Moreover, we benchmark density correlations with numerical simulations and find that the effective temperature of the system is on the order of the tunnel coupling. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of scaling periodically driven quantum systems to large, strongly correlated phases, paving the way for exploring topological quantum matter with single-atom resolution and control.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09481'&gt;arXiv:2412.09481&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 12 Dec 2024 17:27:49 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Rainbow chains and numerical renormalisation group for accurate chiral conformal spectra</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Attila Szabó&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Based on the relationship between reduced and thermal density matrices in conformal field theory (CFT), we show that the entanglement spectrum of a conformal critical chain with exponentially decaying terms consists of conformal towers of the associated chiral CFT, with only weak finite-size effects. Through free-fermion and interacting examples, we show that these entanglement spectra present a reliable method to extract detailed CFT spectra from single wave functions without access to the parent Hamiltonian. We complement our method with a Wilsonian numerical renormalisation group algorithm for solving interacting, exponentially decaying chain Hamiltonians.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09685'&gt;arXiv:2412.09685&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 12 Dec 2024 19:02:49 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

These MP states represent the exact Ground State solutions of the system and display distinctive characteristics determined by a maximum of three parameters exhibiting one antiferromagnetic Haldane phase (AFMH), together with a secondary weak antiferromagnetic (WAFM) and a weak ferromagnetic phase (WFM). Using Transfer Matrix Method (TM), we have obtained nontrivial features in the variation of Quantum Correlation measures and QIT Measures around the VBS point for an acritical choice of the parameters, and a Quantum Critical Point, for a critical choice of the parameters, of the AFMH spin liquid phase of the system.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09891'&gt;arXiv:2412.09891&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 13 Dec 2024 06:09:16 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Entangled states from sparsely coupled spins for metrology with neutral atoms</title>

Daley&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Quantum states featuring extensive multipartite entanglement are a resource for quantum-enhanced metrology, with sensitivity up to the Heisenberg limit. However, robust generation of these states using unitary dynamics typically requires all-to-all interactions among particles. Here, we demonstrate that optimal states for quantum sensing can be generated with sparse interaction graphs featuring only a logarithmic number of couplings per particle. We show that specific sparse graphs with long-range interactions can approximate the dynamics of all-to-all spin models, such as the one-axis twisting model, even for large system sizes. The resulting sparse coupling graphs and protocol can also be efficiently implemented using dynamic reconfiguration of atoms in optical tweezers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10010'&gt;arXiv:2412.10010&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 13 Dec 2024 09:53:56 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

However, the study of quantum interface dynamics has remained an outstanding challenge. Here, we use large-scale Tree Tensor Network simulations to identify the dynamical signature of an interface roughening transition within the ferromagnetic phase of the 2D quantum Ising model. For initial domain wall profiles we find extended prethermal plateaus for smooth interfaces, whereas above the roughening transition the domain wall decays quickly. Our results can be readily explored experimentally in Rydberg atomic systems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10145'&gt;arXiv:2412.10145&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 13 Dec 2024 13:57:23 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Real-Time Simulation of Asymmetry Generation in Fermion-Bubble Collisions</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10365</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Marcela Carena, Ying-Ying Li, Tong Ou, Hersh Singh&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Motivated by the out-of-equilibrium dynamics during an early-universe first-order phase transition, we perform real-time simulations of fermion-bubble scattering in $1+1$ dimensions. This nonequilibrium process can generate a charge-conjugation $\mathsf{C}$ asymmetry outside the bubble wall, induced by the complex fermion mass profile. The resulting $\mathsf{C}$ asymmetry is the 1+1-dimensional analog of the $\mathsf{CP}$ asymmetry in 3+1 dimensions, a key ingredient in baryon asymmetry generation at the electroweak scale. Using tensor network methods, we track the real-time evolution of the $\mathsf{C}$ asymmetry in the charge density as the fermion interacts with the bubble wall, a regime inaccessible to analytic calculations. We further introduce two observables to quantify the asymmetry in the asymptotic region where reflected particles are well separated from the scattering point: one based on the net charge outside the bubble wall, and the other on the spatial displacement between the reflected particle and antiparticle wavepackets. Our study represents a first step toward nonperturbative, real-time computations of $\mathsf{CP}$ asymmetry in 3+1 dimensions for electroweak baryogenesis.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10365'&gt;arXiv:2412.10365&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 13 Dec 2024 18:57:10 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Floquet-Thermalization via Instantons near Dynamical Freezing</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10498</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Rohit Mukherjee, Haoyu Guo, Debanjan Chowdhury&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Periodically driven Floquet quantum many-body systems have revealed new insights into the rich interplay of thermalization, and growth of entanglement. The phenomenology of dynamical freezing, whereby a translationally invariant many-body system exhibits emergent conservation laws and a slow growth of entanglement entropy at certain fixed ratios of a drive amplitude and frequency, presents a novel paradigm for retaining memory of an initial state upto late times. Previous studies of dynamical freezing have largely been restricted to a high-frequency Floquet-Magnus expansion, and numerical exact diagonalization, which are unable to capture the slow approach to thermalization (or lack thereof) in a systematic fashion. By employing Floquet flow-renormalization, where the time-dependent part of the Hamiltonian is gradually decoupled from the effective Hamiltonian using a sequence of unitary transformations, we unveil the universal approach to dynamical freezing and beyond, at asymptotically late times. We analyze the fixed-point behavior associated with the flow-renormalization at and near freezing using both exact-diagonalization and tensor-network based methods, and contrast the results with conventional prethermal phenomenon. For a generic non-integrable spin Hamiltonian with a periodic cosine wave drive, the flow approaches an unstable fixed point with an approximate emergent symmetry. We observe that at freezing the thermalization timescales are delayed compared to away from freezing, and the flow trajectory undergoes a series of instanton events. Our numerical results are supported by analytical solutions to the flow equations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10498'&gt;arXiv:2412.10498&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 13 Dec 2024 19:00:01 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Phase diagram of Rydberg atoms in a two-leg rectangular ladder</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11201</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Shu-Ao Liao, Jin Zhang, Li-Ping Yang&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Using the density matrix renormalization group algorithm, we map the ground-state phase diagram of a two-leg Rydberg ladder array with lattice spacings $a_x=2a_y$. We identify various density wave phases that spontaneously break the translational symmetry or the top-bottom reflection symmetry within the ladder. By increasing the laser detuning from zero, where the system is in a disordered phase that preserves all symmetries, we observe density wave orders with spontaneous breaking of the translational $\mathbb{Z}_p$ symmetries at intermediate detuning values, while the reflection symmetry is preserved. These orders exhibit nonzero bond orders with positive expectation values on every $p$th rung, thus labeled as $\mathbb{Z}_p^+$ phases. At larger detuning values, another spontaneous breaking of the reflection symmetry, which disrupted the bond orders on the rungs, occurs via an Ising phase transition. In these phases, either the top or the bottom site is occupied in a staggered way on every $p$th rung, breaking the translational $\mathbb{Z}_{2p}$ symmetry, thus labeled by $\mathbb{Z}_{2p}$ phases. We locate and characterize the 3-state Potts point and Ashkin-Teller point along the commensurate lines, as well as the direct chiral phase transitions between the disordered phase and the $\mathbb{Z}_p^+$ ($p = 3, 4$) phases. Critical exponents $\nu$ and $z$ are calculated for both conformal and chiral phase transition points. We finally identify two types of floating phases in the phase diagram: one characterized by a quasi-long-range incommensurate bond-order wave, and the other by a quasi-long-range incommensurate wave of density differences in the rungs. Our work motivates further applications of Rydberg atom arrays in quantum simulation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11201'&gt;arXiv:2412.11201&lt;/a&gt;] Published Sun, 15 Dec 2024 14:28:59 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Inexact Proximal Point Algorithms for Zeroth-Order Global Optimization</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11485</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Minxin Zhang, Fuqun Han, Yat Tin Chow, Stanley Osher, Hayden Schaeffer&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; This work concerns the zeroth-order global minimization of continuous nonconvex functions with a unique global minimizer and possibly multiple local minimizers. We formulate a theoretical framework for inexact proximal point (IPP) methods for global optimization, establishing convergence guarantees under mild assumptions when either deterministic or stochastic estimates of proximal operators are used. The quadratic regularization in the proximal operator and the scaling effect of a parameter $\delta&gt;0$ create a concentrated landscape of an associated Gibbs measure that is practically effective for sampling. The convergence of the expectation under the Gibbs measure as $\delta\to 0^+$ is established, and the convergence rate of $\mathcal O(\delta)$ is derived under additional assumptions. These results provide a theoretical foundation for evaluating proximal operators inexactly using sampling-based methods such as Monte Carlo (MC) integration. In addition, we propose a new approach based on tensor train (TT) approximation. This approach employs a randomized TT cross algorithm to efficiently construct a low-rank TT approximation of a discretized function using a small number of function evaluations, and we provide an error analysis for the TT-based estimation. We then propose two practical IPP algorithms, TT-IPP and MC-IPP. The TT-IPP algorithm leverages TT estimates of the proximal operators, while the MC-IPP algorithm employs MC integration to estimate the proximal operators. Both algorithms are designed to adaptively balance efficiency and accuracy in inexact evaluations of proximal operators. The effectiveness of the two algorithms is demonstrated through experiments on diverse benchmark functions and various applications.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11485'&gt;arXiv:2412.11485&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 16 Dec 2024 06:56:45 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>SFFT-Based Homogenization: Using Tensor Trains to Enhance FFT-Based Homogenization</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11566</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Sascha H. Hauck, Matthias Kabel, Mazen Ali, Nicolas R. Gauger&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Homogenization is a fundamental technique for estimating the macroscopic properties of materials with microscale heterogeneity. Among Homogenization methods, the FFT-based Homogenization algorithm has become widely used due to its computational efficiency and ability to handle complex microstructures. Nevertheless, even with GPU acceleration, FFT-based Homogenization for industrial applications remains excessively time-consuming, particularly when generating elastic training data for AI models. This is due to the curse of dimensionality, which arises from the algorithms reliance on the Fast Fourier Transform, creating a fundamental bottleneck. In this paper, we propose a quantum-inspired SFFT-based Homogenization algorithm that leverages the improved time complexity of a Tensor Train variant of the Quantum Fourier Transform. By additionally exploiting structural properties of the underlying microstructure, our method achieves exponential improvements in time complexity and memory efficiency compared to the traditional FFT-based technique - all while remaining executable on classical hardware. We evaluate the performance of our algorithm across increasingly complex microstructures, demonstrating its potential advantages and limitations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11566'&gt;arXiv:2412.11566&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 16 Dec 2024 08:53:12 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Density Matrix Renormalization Group Study of Domain Wall Qubits</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11585</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Guanxiong Qu, Ji Zou, Daniel Loss, Tomoki Hirosawa&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Nanoscale topological spin textures in magnetic systems are emerging as promising candidates for scalable quantum architectures. Despite their potential as qubits, previous studies have been limited to semiclassical approaches, leaving a critical gap: the lack of a fully quantum demonstration. Here, we address this challenge by employing the density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) method to establish domain wall (DW) qubits in coupled quantum spin-1/2 chains. We calculate the ground-state energies and excitation gaps of the system and find that DWs with opposite chiralities form a well-defined low-energy sector, distinctly isolated from higher excited states in the presence of anisotropies. This renders the chirality states suitable for encoding quantum information, serving as robust qubits. Interestingly, when a magnetic field is applied, we observe tunneling between quantum DW states with opposite chiralities. Through quantum simulations, we construct an effective qubit Hamiltonian that exhibits strongly anisotropic $g$-factors, offering a way to implement single-qubit gates. Furthermore, we obtain an effective interacting Hamiltonian for two mobile DWs in coupled quantum spin chains from DMRG simulations, enabling the implementation of two-qubit gates.Single-qubit and two-qubit gates are also demonstrated in real-time simulations using the time-dependent variational principle. Our work represents a critical step from semiclassical constructions to a fully quantum demonstration of the potential of DW textures for scalable quantum computing, establishing a solid foundation for future quantum architectures based on topological magnetic textures.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11585'&gt;arXiv:2412.11585&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 16 Dec 2024 09:17:36 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Many-body dynamics with explicitly time-dependent neural quantum states</title>

Neural quantum states (NQS) offer a promising tool for representing quantum wavefunctions, but their application to time evolution faces scaling challenges. We introduce the time-dependent neural quantum state (t-NQS), a novel approach incorporating explicit time dependence into the neural network ansatz. This framework optimizes a single, time-independent set of parameters to solve the time-dependent Schrödinger equation across an entire time interval. We detail an autoregressive, attention-based transformer architecture and techniques for extending the model's applicability. To benchmark and demonstrate our method, we simulate quench dynamics in the 2D transverse field Ising model and the time-dependent preparation of the 2D antiferromagnetic state in a Heisenberg model, demonstrating state of the art performance, scalability, and extrapolation to unseen intervals. These results establish t-NQS as a powerful framework for exploring quantum dynamics in strongly correlated systems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11830'&gt;arXiv:2412.11830&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 16 Dec 2024 14:53:26 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Learning interactions between Rydberg atoms</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Olivier Simard, Anna Dawid, Joseph Tindall, Michel Ferrero, Anirvan M. Sengupta, Antoine Georges&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Quantum simulators have the potential to solve quantum many-body problems that are beyond the reach of classical computers, especially when they feature long-range entanglement. To fulfill their prospects, quantum simulators must be fully controllable, allowing for precise tuning of the microscopic physical parameters that define their implementation. We consider Rydberg-atom arrays, a promising platform for quantum simulations. Experimental control of such arrays is limited by the imprecision on the optical tweezers positions when assembling the array, hence introducing uncertainties in the simulated Hamiltonian. In this work, we introduce a scalable approach to Hamiltonian learning using graph neural networks (GNNs). We employ the Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) to generate ground-state snapshots of the transverse field Ising model realized by the array, for many realizations of the Hamiltonian parameters. Correlation functions reconstructed from these snapshots serve as input data to carry out the training. We demonstrate that our GNN model has a remarkable capacity to extrapolate beyond its training domain, both regarding the size and the shape of the system, yielding an accurate determination of the Hamiltonian parameters with a minimal set of measurements. We prove a theorem establishing a bijective correspondence between the correlation functions and the interaction parameters in the Hamiltonian, which provides a theoretical foundation to our learning algorithm. Our work could open the road to feedback control of the positions of the optical tweezers, hence providing a decisive improvement of analog quantum simulators.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12019'&gt;arXiv:2412.12019&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 16 Dec 2024 17:45:30 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

The hopping amplitudes and chemical potentials are chosen such that the single-particle eigenstates are related to discrete orthogonal polynomials of the Askey scheme. Due to the bispectral properties of these functions, one can construct an operator which commutes exactly with the entanglement Hamiltonian and corresponds to a linear or parabolic deformation of the physical one. We show that this deformation is interpreted as a local inverse temperature and can be obtained in the continuum limit via methods of conformal field theory. Using this prediction, the properly rescaled eigenvalues of the commuting operator are found to provide a very good approximation of the entanglement spectrum and entropy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12021'&gt;arXiv:2412.12021&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 16 Dec 2024 17:46:53 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>QG from SymQRG: AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$ Correspondence as Topological Symmetry-Preserving Quantum RG Flow</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12045</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Ning Bao, Ling-Yan Hung, Yikun Jiang, Zhihan Liu&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; By analyzing the non-perturbative RG flows that explicitly preserve given symmetries, we demonstrate that they can be expressed as quantum path integrals of the $\textit{SymTFT}$ in one higher dimension. When the symmetries involved include Virasoro defect lines, such as in the case of $T\bar{T}$ deformations, the RG flow corresponds to the 3D quantum gravitational path integral. For each 2D CFT, we identify a corresponding ground state of the SymTFT, from which the Wheeler-DeWitt equation naturally emerges as a non-perturbative constraint. These observations are summarized in the slogan: $\textbf{SymQRG = QG}$. The recently proposed exact discrete formulation of Liouville theory in [1] allows us to identify a universal SymQRG kernel, constructed from quantum $6j$ symbols associated with $U_q(SL(2,\mathbb{R}))$. This kernel is directly related to the quantum path integral of the Virasoro TQFT, and manifests itself as an exact and analytical 3D background-independent MERA-type holographic tensor network. Many aspects of the AdS/CFT correspondence, including the factorization puzzle, admit a natural interpretation within this framework. This provides the first evidence suggesting that there is a universal holographic principle encompassing AdS/CFT and topological holography. We propose that the non-perturbative AdS/CFT correspondence is a $\textit{maximal}$ form of topological holography.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12045'&gt;arXiv:2412.12045&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 16 Dec 2024 18:15:11 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

When embedding $D$-dimensional multivariate probability distributions by discretizing each dimension into $2^n$ points, we need a state preparation circuit comprising a total of $nD$ qubits, which is often difficult to compile. In this study, we propose a scalable method to generate state preparation circuits for $D$-dimensional multivariate normal distributions, utilizing tree tensor networks (TTN). We establish theoretical guarantees that multivariate normal distributions with 1D correlation structures can be efficiently represented using TTN. Based on these analyses, we propose a compilation method that uses automatic structural optimization to find the most efficient network structure and compact circuit. We apply our method to state preparation circuits for various high-dimensional random multivariate normal distributions. The numerical results suggest that our method can dramatically reduce the circuit depth and CNOT count while maintaining fidelity compared to existing approaches.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12067'&gt;arXiv:2412.12067&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 16 Dec 2024 18:41:51 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Strong and weak symmetries and their spontaneous symmetry breaking in mixed states emerging from the quantum Ising model under multiple decoherence</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12738</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Takahiro Orito, Yoshihito Kuno, Ikuo Ichinose&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Discovering and categorizing quantum orders in mixed many-body systems are currently one of the most important problems. Specific types of decoherence applied to typical quantum many-body states can induce a novel kind of mixed state accompanying characteristic symmetry orders, which has no counterparts in pure many-body states. We study phenomena generated by interplay between two types of decoherence applied to the one-dimensional transverse field Ising model (TFIM). We show that in the doubled Hilbert space formalism, the decoherence can be described by filtering operation applied to matrix product states (MPS) defined in the doubled Hilbert system. The filtering operation induces specific deformation of the MPS, which approximates the ground state of a certain parent Hamiltonian in the doubled Hilbert space. In the present case, such a parent Hamiltonian is the quantum Ashkin-Teller model, having a rich phase diagram with a critical lines and quantum phase transitions. By investigating the deformed MPS, we find various types of mixed states emergent from the ground states of the TFIM, and clarify phase transitions between them. In that study, strong and weak $Z_2$ symmetries play an important role, for which we introduce efficient order parameters, such as R\'{e}nyi-2 correlators, entanglement entropy, etc., in the doubled Hilbert space.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12738'&gt;arXiv:2412.12738&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 17 Dec 2024 10:00:29 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Theory of electron-phonon interactions in extended correlated systems probed by resonant inelastic x-ray scattering</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12995</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Jinu Thomas, Debshikha Banerjee, Alberto Nocera, Steven Johnston&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; An emerging application of resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) is the study of lattice excitations and electron-phonon ($e$-ph) interactions in quantum materials. Despite the growing importance of this area of research, the community lacks a complete understanding of how the RIXS process excites the lattice and how these excitations encode information about the $e$-ph interactions. Here, we present a detailed study of the RIXS spectra of the Hubbard-Holstein model defined on extended one-dimensional lattices. Using the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) method, we compute the RIXS response while treating the electron mobility, many-body interactions, and core-hole interactions on an equal footing. The predicted spectra exhibit notable differences from those obtained using the commonly adopted Lang-Firsov models, with important implications for analyzing past and future experiments. Our results provide a deeper understanding of how RIXS probes $e$-ph interactions and set the stage for a more realistic analysis of future experiments.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12995'&gt;arXiv:2412.12995&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 17 Dec 2024 15:15:00 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Density Matrix Renormalization Group simulations of the SU(N) Fermi-Hubbard chain implementing the full SU(N) symmetry via Semi-Standard Young Tableaux and Unitary Group Subduction Coefficients</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13320</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Pierre Nataf&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We have developed an efficient method for performing density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations of the SU(N) Fermi-Hubbard chain with open boundary conditions, fully leveraging the SU(N) symmetry of the problem. This method extends a previously developed approach for the SU(N) Heisenberg model and relies on the systematic use of the semi-standard Young tableaux (SSYT) basis in a DMRG algorithm `a la White. Specifically, the method aligns the site-by-site growth process of the infinite-size part of the DMRG, in its original formulation, with the site-by-site construction of the SSYT (or Gelfand-like) basis, based on the chain of unitary subgroups $U(1)\subset U(2) \subset U(3) \subset U(4)\cdots $. We give special emphasis to the calculation of the symmetry-resolved reduced matrix elements of the hopping terms between the left and the right block, which makes direct use of the basis of SSYT and of the Gelfand-Tsetlin coefficients, offering a computational advantage in scaling with N compared to alternative methods that rely on summing over Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. Focusing on the model with homogeneous hopping between nearest neighbors, we have calculated the ground state energy as a function of U, i.e the atom-atom interaction amplitude, up to N=6 for filling 1/N (one particle per site in average), and for one atom (resp. hole) away from filling 1/N, alllowing us to compute the charge gaps, and to estimate in the thermodynamical limit, the critical value $U_c$, separating the Mott insulator from the metallic phase. Central charges c are extracted from the entanglement entropy using the Calabrese-Cardy formula, and are consistent with the theoretical predictions: c=N-1, expected from the $SU(N)_1$ Wess-Zumino-Witten CFTs in the spin sector for the Mott phase, and c=N in the metallic phase, reflecting the presence of one additional (charge) gapless critical mode.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13320'&gt;arXiv:2412.13320&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 17 Dec 2024 20:39:14 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Generic Method for Integrating Lindblad Master Equations</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13661</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Jiayin Gu, Fan Zhang&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The time evolution of Markovian open quantum systems is governed by Lindblad master equations, whose solution can be formally written as the Lindbladian exponential acting on the initial density matrix. By expanding this Lindbladian exponential into the Taylor series, we propose a generic method for integrating Lindblad master equations. In this method, the series is truncated, retaining a finite number of terms, and the iterative actions of Lindbladian on the density matrix follow the corresponding master equation. Our method offers significant improvements in numerical efficiencies both in memory cost and computation time, especially for systems with many degrees of freedom. Moreover, our proposed method can be integrated seamlessly with tensor networks. Two illustrative examples, a two-level system exhibiting damped Rabi oscillations and a driven dissipative Heisenberg chain, are used to demonstrate the validity of our method. The superiority of our method is benchmarked with detailed performance tests.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13661'&gt;arXiv:2412.13661&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 18 Dec 2024 09:38:55 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Underscreened Kondo Compensation in a Superconductor</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13687</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Anand Manaparambil, Cătălin Paşcu Moca, Gergely Zaránd, Ireneusz Weymann&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; A magnetic impurity with a larger $S=1$ spin remains partially screened by the Kondo effect when embedded in a metal. However, when placed within an $s$-wave superconductor, the interplay between the superconducting energy gap $\Delta$ and the Kondo temperature $T_K$ induces a quantum phase transition from an underscreened doublet Kondo to an unscreened triplet phase, typically occurring when $\Delta/T_K\approx 1$. We investigate the Kondo compensation of the impurity spin resulting from this partial screening across the quantum phase transition, which together with the spin-spin correlation function serves as a measure of the Kondo cloud's integrity. Deep within the unscreened triplet phase, $\Delta/T_K\gg 1$, the compensation vanishes, signifying complete decoupling of the impurity spin from the environment, while in the partially screened doublet phase, $\Delta/T_K\ll 1$, it asymptotically approaches $1/2$, indicating that half of the spin is screened. Notably, there is a universal jump in the compensation precisely at the phase transition, which we accurately calculate. The spin-spin correlation function exhibits an oscillatory pattern with an envelope function decaying as $\sim 1/x$ at short distances. At larger distances, the superconducting gap induces an exponentially decaying behavior $\sim \exp(-x/\xi_\Delta)$ governed by the superconducting correlation length $\xi_\Delta$, irrespective of the phase, without any distinctive features across the transition. Furthermore, the spectral functions of some relevant operators are evaluated and discussed. In terms of the methods used, a consistent description is provided through the application of multiplicative, numerical and density matrix renormalization group techniques.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13687'&gt;arXiv:2412.13687&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 18 Dec 2024 10:26:26 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Tensor-network decoders for process tensor descriptions of non-Markovian noise</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13739</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Fumiyoshi Kobayashi, Hidetaka Manabe, Gregory A. L. White, Terry Farrelly, Kavan Modi, Thomas M. Stace&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Quantum error correction (QEC) is essential for fault-tolerant quantum computation. Often in QEC errors are assumed to be independent and identically distributed and can be discretised to a random Pauli error during the execution of a quantum circuit. In real devices, however, the noise profile is much more complex and contains non-trivial spatiotemporal correlations, such as cross-talk, non-Markovianity, and their mixtures. Here, we examine the performance of two paradigmatic QEC codes in the presence of complex noise by using process tensors to represent spatiotemporal correlations beyond iid errors. This integration is an instance of the recently proposed \textit{strategic code}, which combines QEC with process tensors. In particular, we construct the maximum likelihood (ML) decoder for a quantum error correction code with a process tensor. To understand the computational overhead and implications of this approach, we implement our framework numerically for small code instances and evaluate its performance. We also propose a method to evaluate the performance of strategic codes and construct the ML decoder with an efficient tensor network approximation. Our results highlight the possible detrimental effects of correlated noise and potential pathways for designing decoders that account for such effects.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13739'&gt;arXiv:2412.13739&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 18 Dec 2024 11:17:09 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional real space renormalization group with well-controlled approximations</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13758</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Xinliang Lyu, Naoki Kawashima&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We make Kadanoff's block idea into a reliable three-dimensional (3D) real space renormalization group (RG) method. Kadanoff's idea, expressed in spin representation, offers a qualitative intuition for clarifying scaling behavior in criticality, but has difficulty as a quantitative tool due to uncontrolled approximations. A tensor-network reformulation equips the block idea with a measure of RG errors. In 3D, we propose an entanglement filtering scheme to enhance such a block-tensor map, with the lattice reflection symmetry exploited. When the proposed RG is applied to the cubic-lattice Ising model, the RG errors are reduced to about 2% by retaining more couplings. The estimated scaling dimensions of the two relevant fields have errors 0.4% and 0.1% in the best case, compared with the accepted values. The proposed RG is promising as a systematically-improvable real space RG method in 3D. The unique feature of our method is its ability to numerically obtain a 3D critical fixed point in a high-dimensional tensor space. A fixed-point tensor contains much more information than a handful of observables estimated in conventional techniques for analyzing critical systems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13758'&gt;arXiv:2412.13758&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 18 Dec 2024 11:53:05 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

In the massless case, the Williamson decomposition of the appearing kernels is explicitly performed, which allows to reproduce the known result for the entanglement (modular) Hamiltonian and, for a small mass $M$ of the field, find the leading $\sim1/\ln M$ non-local corrections. In the opposite $M\to\infty$ case, it is argued that, up to terms $O(M^{-1/2})$, the entanglement Hamiltonian is local with the density being the Hamiltonian density spatially modulated by a triangular-shape function.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13777'&gt;arXiv:2412.13777&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 18 Dec 2024 12:13:38 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Discretization of Structured Bosonic Environments at Finite Temperature by Interpolative Decomposition: Theory and Application</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Hideaki Takahashi, Raffaele Borrelli&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We present a comprehensive theory for a novel method to discretize the spectral density of a bosonic heat bath, as introduced in [H. Takahashi and R. Borrelli, J. Chem. Phys. \textbf{161}, 151101 (2024)]. The approach leverages a low-rank decomposition of the Fourier-transform relation connecting the bath correlation function to its spectral density. By capturing the time, frequency, and temperature dependencies encoded in the spectral density-autocorrelation function relation, our method significantly reduces the degrees of freedom required for simulating open quantum system dynamics. We benchmark our approach against existing methods and demonstrate its efficacy through applications to both simple models and a realistic electron transfer process in biological systems. Additionally, we show that this new approach can be effectively combined with the tensor-train formalism to investigate the quantum dynamics of systems interacting with complex non-Markovian environments. Finally, we provide a perspective on the selection and application of various spectral density discretization techniques.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13793'&gt;arXiv:2412.13793&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 18 Dec 2024 12:38:10 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Weak ergodicity breaking with isolated integrable sectors</title>

In these models, the majority of the eigenstates are thermal, but there is a distinguished subspace of the Hilbert space in which ergodicity is broken. We achieve such a weak breaking by embedding selected integrable models into larger Hilbert spaces of otherwise chaotic models. The integrable subspaces do not have a tensor product structure with respect to any spatial bipartition, therefore our constructions differ from certain trivial embeddings. We consider multiple mechanisms for such an embedding, and we also review previous examples in the literature. Curiously, all our examples can be seen as perturbations of models with Hilbert space fragmentation, such that the perturbed models are not fragmented anymore.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13951'&gt;arXiv:2412.13951&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 18 Dec 2024 15:31:44 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

This problem can be overcome with the recently introduced quantics tensor train (QTT) representation of multivariable functions. Here, we demonstrate nonequilibrium Green's function simulations within the $GW$ and Migdal approximations with high momentum resolution, up to times which exceed the capabilities of standard implementations and are long enough to study, e.g., transient Floquet physics during multi-cycle electric field pulses and thermalization dynamics. The self-consistent calculation on the three-leg Kadanoff-Baym contour is fully self-contained, employing only QTT-compressed functions and input functions which are either generated directly in QTT form or obtained via quantics tensor cross interpolation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14032'&gt;arXiv:2412.14032&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 18 Dec 2024 16:51:53 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Applying the Triad network representation to four-dimensional ATRG method</title>

However, the larger bond dimensions are known to be difficult to achieve in practice due to the higher computational cost. Adopting the methods of the minimally decomposed TRG and its triad prescriptions, we construct a triad representation of the four-dimensional ATRG by decomposing the unit-cell tensor. We observe that this combining approach can significantly improve the computational cost even with maintaining the convergence accuracy of the free energy in the four-dimensional Ising model. In addition, we also show that a further improvement can be achieved in terms of the computational cost when our proposed approach is implemented in parallel on GPUs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14104'&gt;arXiv:2412.14104&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 18 Dec 2024 17:50:18 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

Specifically, we consider ensembles produced by: (i) random sequential unitary circuits, (ii) random brickwork unitary circuits, and (iii) circuits involving both unitaries and projective measurements. In all cases, we analyze the spectra of the MPS transfer matrices and relate them to the spreading of mutual information in the MPS state. We demonstrate how different features of the spectral density correspond to distinct types of circuits, revealing that these MPS ensembles retain crucial physical information about the underlying microscopic dynamics. Notably, in the presence of quantum monitoring, we show the existence of a measurement-induced entanglement transition (MIPT) in MPS ensembles, with the averaged dimension of the transfer matrix's null space serving as the effective order parameter.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14261'&gt;arXiv:2412.14261&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 18 Dec 2024 19:00:33 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

Two kinds of species of charge carriers, holes and electrons, diffuse in this system with the pair-generation and -recombination reaction occurring between them. The tensor networks are used to numerically calculate the cumulant generating function of the current statistics. By comparing the cases whether the reaction is turned on or off, the influence of the reaction on current fluctuations is clearly manifested, and this provides a numerical evidence of an interesting inequality setting an upper bound on the diffusivity in terms of the mean current and the driving force or affinity.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14385'&gt;arXiv:2412.14385&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 18 Dec 2024 22:38:15 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>A tensor-train reduced basis solver for parameterized partial differential equations on Cartesian grids</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14460</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Nicholas Mueller, Yiran Zhao, Santiago Badia, Tiangang Cui&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; In this manuscript, we introduce the tensor-train reduced basis method, a novel projection-based reduced-order model designed for the efficient solution of parameterized partial differential equations. While reduced-order models are widely used for their computational efficiency compared to full-order models, they often involve significant offline computational costs. Our proposed approach mitigates this limitation by leveraging the tensor train format to efficiently represent high-dimensional finite element quantities. This method offers several advantages, including a reduced number of operations for constructing the reduced subspaces, a cost-effective hyper-reduction strategy for assembling the PDE residual and Jacobian, and a lower dimensionality of the projection subspaces for a given accuracy. We provide a posteriori error estimates to validate the accuracy of the method and evaluate its computational performance on benchmark problems, including the Poisson equation, heat equation, and transient linear elasticity in two- and three-dimensional domains. Although the current framework is restricted to problems defined on Cartesian grids, we anticipate that it can be extended to arbitrary shapes by integrating the tensor-train reduced basis method with unfitted finite element techniques.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14460'&gt;arXiv:2412.14460&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 19 Dec 2024 02:20:51 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Spin fractionalization at the edge of quantum Hall fluids induced by bulk quasiparticles</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Alexander Fagerlund, Alberto Nardin, Leonardo Mazza, Eddy Ardonne&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We define a measurable spin for the edge of a lowest Landau level and incompressible fractional quantum Hall state in the presence of an Abelian or non-Abelian bulk quasiparticle. We show that this quantity takes a fractional value inherited from the fractional spin of the bulk quasiparticle. We present a geometric picture that does not rely on global symmetries of the wavefunction but is able to treat quasiparticles and edges with different shapes. We study finite-size many-body wavefunctions on the cylinder with circular quasiparticles and straight edges. Our results are supported by matrix-product-state calculations for the Laughlin and the k=3 Read-Rezayi states.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14879'&gt;arXiv:2412.14879&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 19 Dec 2024 14:15:51 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Dynamic Realization of Majorana Zero Modes in a Particle-Conserving Ladder</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Anais Defossez, Laurens Vanderstraeten, Lucila Peralta Gavensky, Nathan Goldman&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We present a scheme to realize a topological superconducting system supporting Majorana zero modes, within a number-conserving framework suitable for optical-lattice experiments. Our approach builds on the engineering of pair-hopping processes on a ladder geometry, using a sequence of pulses that activate single-particle hopping in a time-periodic manner. We demonstrate that this dynamic setting is well captured by an effective Hamiltonian that preserves the parity symmetry, a key requirement for the stabilization of Majorana zero modes. The phase diagram of our system is determined using a bosonization theory, which is then validated by a numerical study of the topological bulk gap and entanglement spectrum using matrix product states. Our results indicate that Majorana zero modes can be stabilized in a large parameter space, accessible in optical-lattice experiments.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14886'&gt;arXiv:2412.14886&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 19 Dec 2024 14:19:51 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>A bosonic matrix product state description of Read-Rezayi states and its application to quasi-hole spins</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Alexander Fagerlund, Eddy Ardonne&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We study the $k=3$ Read-Rezayi quantum Hall state by means of a purely bosonic matrix product state formulation, which is described in detail. We calculate the density profiles in the presence of bulk quasi-holes of six different types: one for each $\mathbb{Z}_3$ parafermion sector. From the density profiles, we calculate the (local) spins of these quasi-holes. By employing a spin-statistics relation, we obtain the exchange statistics parameters. Our results, which are entirely based on local properties of the quasi-holes, corroborate previous results obtained by explicitly braiding quasi-holes, showing that the exchange statistics can be read off from the monodromy properties of the wave functions, i.e., that the associated Berry phase vanishes. We also discuss the entanglement spectrum, to show that our bosonic matrix product state formulation correctly captures the $\mathbb{Z}_3$ parafermionic structure of the $k=3$ Read-Rezayi states.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14889'&gt;arXiv:2412.14889&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 19 Dec 2024 14:21:49 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Dynamic structure factor of a spin-1/2 Heisenberg chain with long-range interactions</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15168</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Sibin Yang, Gabe Schumm, Anders W. Sandvik&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We study the dynamic structure factor $S(k,\omega)$ of the spin-1/2 chain with long-range, power-law decaying unfrustrated (sign alternating) Heisenberg interactions $J_r \sim (-1)^{r-1} r^{-\alpha}$ by means of stochastic analytic continuation (SAC) of imaginary-time correlations computed by quantum Monte Carlo calculations. We do so in both the long-range antiferromagnetic (AFM, for $\alpha \lesssim 2.23$) and quasi-long-range-ordered (QLRO, for $\alpha \gtrsim 2.23$) ground-state phases, employing different SAC parametrizations of $S(k,\omega)$ to resolve sharp edges characteristic of fractional quasi-particles and sharp peaks expected with conventional quasi-particles. In order to identify the most statistically accurate parametrization, we apply a newly developed cross-validation method as a ``model selection'' tool. We confirm that the spectral function contains a power-law divergent edge in the QLRO phase and a very sharp (likely $\delta$-function) magnon peak in the AFM phase. From our SAC results, we extract the dispersion relation in the different regimes of the model, and in the AFM phase we extract the weight of the magnon pole. In the limit where the model reduces to the conventional Heisenberg chain with nearest-neighbor interactions, our $S(k,\omega)$ agrees well with known Bethe ansatz results. In the AFM phase the low-energy dispersion relation is known to be nonlinear, $\omega_k \sim k^z$, and we extract the corresponding dynamic exponent $z(\alpha)$, which in general is somewhat above the form obtained in linear spin-wave theory. We also find a significant continuum above the magnon peak. This study serves as a benchmark for SAC/QMC studies of systems with a transition from conventional to fractionalized quasi-particles.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15168'&gt;arXiv:2412.15168&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 19 Dec 2024 18:43:01 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Adiabatic preparation of a number-conserving atomic Majorana phase</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15286</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Benjamin Michen, Tim Pokart, Jan Carl Budich&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We construct a protocol to adiabatically prepare the ground state of a widely discussed number-conserving model Hamiltonian for ultracold atoms in optical lattices that supports Majorana edge states. In particular, we introduce a symmetry breaking mass term that amounts to threading a commensurate (artificial) magnetic flux through the plaquettes of the considered two-leg ladder which opens a constant bulk gap. This enables the preparation of the topological Majorana phase from a trivial Mott insulator state with optimal asymptotic scaling of the ramp time in system size, which is linear owing to the critical nature of the target state. Using constructive bosonization techniques that account for both finite size effects and global fermion number conservation, we are able to fully explain with theory the somewhat counterintuitive necessity of the aforementioned commensurate flux for a controlled bulk gap. Our analytical predictions are corroborated and quantified by unbiased numerical matrix product states (MPS) simulations. Directly building up on previous experimental work, the crucial flux-term of the proposed protocol is feasible with state-of-the-art experimental techniques in atomic quantum simulators.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15286'&gt;arXiv:2412.15286&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 18 Dec 2024 19:00:12 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Quantum simulating continuum field theories with large-spin lattice models</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15325</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Gabriele Calliari, Marco Di Liberto, Hannes Pichler, Torsten V. Zache&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Simulating the real-time dynamics of quantum field theories (QFTs) is one of the most promising applications of quantum simulators. Regularizing a bosonic QFT for quantum simulation purposes typically involves a truncation in Hilbert space in addition to a discretization of space. Here, we discuss how to perform such a regularization of scalar QFTs by explicitly constructing suitable many-body lattice Hamiltonians using multi-level or qudit systems, and show that this enables quantitative predictions in the continuum limit by extrapolating results obtained for large-spin models. With extensive matrix-product state simulations, we numerically demonstrate the sequence of extrapolations that leads to quantitative agreement of observables for the integrable sine-Gordon (sG) QFT. We further show how to prepare static and moving soliton excitations, and analyze their scattering dynamics in the continuum limit, in agreement with a semi-classical model and with quantitative analytical predictions. Finally, we illustrate how a non-integrable perturbation of the sG model gives rise to dynamics reminiscent of string breaking and plasma oscillations in gauge theories. Our methods are directly applicable in state-of-the-art analog quantum simulators, opening the door to quantitatively investigating a wide variety of scalar field theories and tackling long-standing questions in non-equilibrium QFT like the fate of the false vacuum.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15325'&gt;arXiv:2412.15325&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 19 Dec 2024 19:00:01 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Weak Hopf non-invertible symmetry-protected topological spin liquid and lattice realization of (1+1)D symmetry topological field theory</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15336</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Zhian Jia&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We introduce weak Hopf symmetry as a tool to explore (1+1)-dimensional topological phases with non-invertible symmetries. Drawing inspiration from Symmetry Topological Field Theory (SymTFT), we construct a lattice model featuring two boundary conditions: one that encodes topological symmetry and another that governs non-topological dynamics. This cluster ladder model generalizes the well-known cluster state model. We demonstrate that the model exhibits weak Hopf symmetry, incorporating both the weak Hopf algebra and its dual. On a closed manifold, the symmetry reduces to cocommutative subalgebras of the weak Hopf algebra. Additionally, we introduce weak Hopf tensor network states to provide an exact solution for the model. As every fusion category corresponds to the representation category of some weak Hopf algebra, fusion category symmetry naturally corresponds to a subalgebra of the dual weak Hopf algebra. Consequently,the cluster ladder model offers a lattice realization of arbitrary fusion category symmetries.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15336'&gt;arXiv:2412.15336&lt;/a&gt;] Published Thu, 19 Dec 2024 19:05:49 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Entanglement entropy for the one-dimensional flat-band ferromagnetic Tasaki model: spontaneous symmetry breaking with one type-B Goldstone mode</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15724</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Huan-Qiang Zhou, Qian-Qian Shi, Ian P. McCulloch, J. O. Fjærestad&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The one-dimensional flat-band ferromagnetic Tasaki model exhibits spontaneous symmetry breaking from ${\rm SU}(2)$ to ${\rm U}(1)$ with one type-B Goldstone mode, featuring that the highest weight state is entangled at quarter filling, but there is always a choice to keep the highest weight state unentangled away from quarter filling. It is found that the ground-state degeneracies under both periodic and open boundary conditions constitute essentially the Fibonacci sequences, behaving asymptotically as the golden spiral - a self-similar geometric object. A set of orthonormal basis states are generated from the repeated action of the lowering operator of the symmetry group ${\rm SU}(2)$ on the highest weight state at a specific filling. In particular, it is possible to construct the orthonormal basis states reflecting an abstract fractal underlying the ground-state subspace, which are permutation-invariant away from quarter filling, but not at quarter filling. As a consequence, there exists a singularity that accounts for the emergence of the saturated flat-band ferromagnetism at quarter filling. We perform a systematic finite system-size scaling analysis of the entanglement entropy, thus confirming that it scales logarithmically with the block size in the thermodynamic limit, with the prefactor being half the number of type-B Goldstone modes, for the orthonormal basis states at and away from quarter filling.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15724'&gt;arXiv:2412.15724&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 20 Dec 2024 09:47:52 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Entanglement entropy scaling laws from fluctuations of non-conserved quantities</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Szczepan Głodzik, Kim Pöyhönen, Ali G. Moghaddam, Teemu Ojanen&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Entanglement patterns reveal essential information on many-body states and provide a way to classify quantum phases of matter. However, experimental studies of many-body entanglement remain scarce due to their unscalable nature. The present work aims to mitigate this theoretical and experimental divide by introducing reduced fluctuations of observables, consisting of a sum of on-site operators, as a scalable experimental probe of the entanglement entropy. Specifically, we illustrate by Density Matrix Renormalization Group calculations in spin chains that the reduced fluctuations exhibit the same size scaling properties as the entanglement entropy. Generalizing previous observations restricted to special systems with conserved quantities, our work introduces experimentally feasible protocol to extract entanglement scaling laws.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15765'&gt;arXiv:2412.15765&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 20 Dec 2024 10:33:54 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Using matrix-product states for time-series machine learning</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15826</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Joshua B. Moore, Hugo P. Stackhouse, Ben D. Fulcher, Sahand Mahmoodian&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Matrix-product states (MPS) have proven to be a versatile ansatz for modeling quantum many-body physics. For many applications, and particularly in one-dimension, they capture relevant quantum correlations in many-body wavefunctions while remaining tractable to store and manipulate on a classical computer. This has motivated researchers to also apply the MPS ansatz to machine learning (ML) problems where capturing complex correlations in datasets is also a key requirement. Here, we develop and apply an MPS-based algorithm, MPSTime, for learning a joint probability distribution underlying an observed time-series dataset, and show how it can be used to tackle important time-series ML problems, including classification and imputation. MPSTime can efficiently learn complicated time-series probability distributions directly from data, requires only moderate maximum MPS bond dimension $\chi_{\rm max}$, with values for our applications ranging between $\chi_{\rm max} = 20-160$, and can be trained for both classification and imputation tasks under a single logarithmic loss function. Using synthetic and publicly available real-world datasets, spanning applications in medicine, energy, and astronomy, we demonstrate performance competitive with state-of-the-art ML approaches, but with the key advantage of encoding the full joint probability distribution learned from the data, which is useful for analyzing and interpreting its underlying structure. This manuscript is supplemented with the release of a publicly available code package MPSTime that implements our approach. The effectiveness of the MPS-based ansatz for capturing complex correlation structures in time-series data makes it a powerful foundation for tackling challenging time-series analysis problems across science, industry, and medicine.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15826'&gt;arXiv:2412.15826&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 20 Dec 2024 12:11:04 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Identifying and quantifying Su-Schrieffer-Heeger-like interactions with RIXS</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Debshikha Banerjee, Jinu Thomas, Alberto Nocera, Steven Johnston&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH)-like electron-phonon (e-ph) interactions can drive the formation of light (bi)polarons and several novel states of matter. It is, therefore, prudent to develop experimental protocols for identifying such couplings in real materials and quantifying their strength. Here, we investigate how resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) probes e-ph interactions in the one-dimensional half-filled Hubbard-SSH model with onsite phonons. Using the density matrix renormalization group method, we compute the full RIXS response and find that the lattice excitations generated during the scattering process inevitably couple to the system's charge and magnetic sectors, resulting in combined multi-particle excitations that cannot be easily disentangled from one another. While this aspect complicates the interpretation of RIXS experiments, we outline how it can be leveraged to identify and quantify SSH-like interactions in quantum materials.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15981'&gt;arXiv:2412.15981&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 20 Dec 2024 15:24:05 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Incremental Hierarchical Tucker Decomposition</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Doruk Aksoy, Alex A. Gorodetsky&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We present two new algorithms for approximating and updating the hierarchical Tucker decomposition of tensor streams. The first algorithm, Batch Hierarchical Tucker - leaf to root (BHT-l2r), proposes an alternative and more efficient way of approximating a batch of similar tensors in hierarchical Tucker format. The second algorithm, Hierarchical Tucker - Rapid Incremental Subspace Expansion (HT-RISE), updates the batch hierarchical Tucker representation of an accumulated tensor as new batches of tensors become available. The HT-RISE algorithm is suitable for the online setting and never requires full storage or reconstruction of all data while providing a solution to the incremental Tucker decomposition problem. We provide theoretical guarantees for both algorithms and demonstrate their effectiveness on physical and cyber-physical data. The proposed BHT-l2r algorithm and the batch hierarchical Tucker format offers up to $6.2\times$ compression and $3.7\times$ reduction in time over the hierarchical Tucker format. The proposed HT-RISE algorithm also offers up to $3.1\times$ compression and $3.2\times$ reduction in time over a state of the art incremental tensor train decomposition algorithm.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16544'&gt;arXiv:2412.16544&lt;/a&gt;] Published Sat, 21 Dec 2024 09:01:04 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Optimal Error Analysis of Channel Estimation for IRS-assisted MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16827</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Zhen Qin, Zhihui Zhu&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; As intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) has emerged as a new and promising technology capable of configuring the wireless environment favorably, channel estimation for IRS-assisted multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems has garnered extensive attention in recent years. While various algorithms have been proposed to address this challenge, there is a lack of rigorous theoretical error analysis. This paper aims to address this gap by providing theoretical guarantees in terms of stable recovery of channel matrices for noisy measurements. We begin by establishing the equivalence between IRS-assisted MIMO systems and a compact tensor train (TT)-based tensor-on-tensor (ToT) regression. Building on this equivalence, we then investigate the restricted isometry property (RIP) for complex-valued subgaussian measurements. Our analysis reveals that successful recovery hinges on the relationship between the number of user terminals (in the uplink scenario) or base stations (in the downlink scenario) and the number of time slots during which channel matrices remain invariant. Utilizing the RIP condition, we analyze the theoretical recovery error for the solution to a constrained least-squares optimization problem, including upper error bound and minimax lower bound, demonstrating that the error decreases inversely with the number of time slots and increases proportionally with the number of unknown elements in the channel matrices. In addition, we extend our error analysis to two more specialized IRS-assisted MIMO systems, incorporating low-rank channel matrices or an unknown IRS. Furthermore, we explore a multi-hop IRS scheme and analyze the corresponding recovery errors. Finally, we introduce and implement two nonconvex optimization algorithms--alternating least squares and alternating gradient descent--to validate our conclusions through simulations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16827'&gt;arXiv:2412.16827&lt;/a&gt;] Published Sun, 22 Dec 2024 02:24:14 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Ariel Kelman, Umberto Borla, Patrick Emonts, Erez Zohar&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Lattice gauge theory is an important framework for studying gauge theories that arise in the Standard Model and condensed matter physics. Yet many systems (or regimes of those systems) are difficult to study using conventional techniques, such as action-based Monte Carlo sampling. In this paper, we demonstrate the use of gauged Gaussian projected entangled pair states as an ansatz for a lattice gauge theory involving dynamical physical matter. We study a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory on a two dimensional lattice with a single flavor of fermionic matter on each lattice site. Our results show agreement with results computed by exactly diagonalizing the Hamiltonian, and demonstrate that the approach is computationally feasible for larger system sizes where exact results are unavailable. This is a further step on the road to studying higher dimensions and other gauge groups with manageable computational costs while avoiding the sign problem.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16951'&gt;arXiv:2412.16951&lt;/a&gt;] Published Sun, 22 Dec 2024 10:12:06 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>A tensor network formulation of Lattice Gauge Theories based only on symmetric tensors</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16961</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Manu Canals, Natalia Chepiga, Luca Tagliacozzo&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The Lattice Gauge Theory Hilbert space is divided into gauge-invariant sectors selected by the background charges. Such a projector can be directly embedded in a tensor network ansatz for gauge-invariant states as originally discussed in [Phys. Rev. B 83, 115127 (2011)] and in [Phys. Rev. X 4, 041024 (2014)] in the context of PEPS. The original ansatz is based on sparse tensors, though parts of them are not explicitly symmetric, and thus their actual implementation in numerical simulations has been hindered by the complexity of developing ad hoc libraries. Here we provide a new PEPS tensor network formulation of gauge-invariant theories purely based on symmetric elementary tensors. The new formulation can be implemented in numerical simulation using available state-of-the-art tensor network libraries but also holds interest from a purely theoretical perspective since it requires embedding the original gauge theory with gauge symmetry G into an enlarged globally symmetric theory with symmetry GxG. By revisiting the original ansatz in the modern landscape of i) duality transformations between gauge and spin systems, ii) finite depth quantum circuits followed by measurements that allow generating topologically ordered states, and iii) Clifford enhanced tensor networks, we show that such a new formulation provides a novel duality transformation between lattice gauge theories and specific sectors of globally invariant systems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16961'&gt;arXiv:2412.16961&lt;/a&gt;] Published Sun, 22 Dec 2024 10:42:05 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Classical simulability of Clifford+T circuits with Clifford-augmented matrix product states</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17209</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Zejun Liu, Bryan K. Clark&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Determining the quantum-classical boundary between quantum circuits which can be efficiently simulated classically and those which cannot remains a fundamental question. One approach to classical simulation is to represent the output of a quantum circuit as a Clifford-augmented Matrix Product State (CAMPS) which, via a disentangling algorithm, decomposes the wave function into Clifford and MPS components and from which Pauli expectation values can be computed in time polynomial in the MPS bond-dimension. In this work, we develop an optimization-free disentangling (OFD) algorithm for Clifford circuits either doped with multi-qubit gates of the form $\alpha I+\beta P$. We give a simple algebraic criterion which characterizes the individual quantum circuits for which OFD generates an efficient CAMPS - the bond-dimension is exponential in the null space of a GF(2) matrix induced by a tableau of the twisted Pauli strings $P$. This significantly increases the number of circuits with rigorous polynomial time classical simulations. We also give evidence that the typical $N$ qubit random Clifford circuit doped with $N$ uniformly distributed $T$ gates of poly-logarithmic depth or greater has a CAMPS with polynomial bond-dimension. In addition, we compare OFD against disentangling by optimization. We further explore the representability of CAMPS for random Clifford circuits doped with more than $N$ $T$-gates. We also propose algorithms for sampling, probability and amplitude estimation of bitstrings, and evaluation of entanglement Rényi entropy from CAMPS, which, though still having exponential complexity, are more efficient than standard MPS simulations. This work establishes a versatile framework for understanding classical simulatability of Clifford+$T$ circuits and explores the interplay between quantum entanglement and quantum magic in quantum systems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17209'&gt;arXiv:2412.17209&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 23 Dec 2024 01:26:40 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Sampling-Based Constrained Motion Planning with Products of Experts</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17462</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Amirreza Razmjoo, Teng Xue, Suhan Shetty, Sylvain Calinon&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We present a novel approach to enhance the performance of sampling-based Model Predictive Control (MPC) in constrained optimization by leveraging products of experts. Our methodology divides the main problem into two components: one focused on optimality and the other on feasibility. By combining the solutions from each component, represented as distributions, we apply products of experts to implement a project-then-sample strategy. In this strategy, the optimality distribution is projected into the feasible area, allowing for more efficient sampling. This approach contrasts with the traditional sample-then-project method, leading to more diverse exploration and reducing the accumulation of samples on the boundaries. We demonstrate an effective implementation of this principle using a tensor train-based distribution model, which is characterized by its non-parametric nature, ease of combination with other distributions at the task level, and straightforward sampling technique. We adapt existing tensor train models to suit this purpose and validate the efficacy of our approach through experiments in various tasks, including obstacle avoidance, non-prehensile manipulation, and tasks involving staying on manifolds. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms known baselines, providing strong empirical support for its effectiveness.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17462'&gt;arXiv:2412.17462&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 23 Dec 2024 10:39:59 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Quantum Phase Diagram of the Bilayer Kitaev-Heisenberg Model</title>

Jahromi&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We study the ground-state phase diagram of the spin-$1/2$ Kitaev-Heisenberg model on the bilayer honeycomb lattice with large-scale tensor network calculations based on the infinite projected entangled pair state technique as well as high-order series expansions. We find that beyond various magnetically ordered phases, including ferromagnetic, zigzag, antiferromagnetic (AFM) and stripy states, two extended quantum spin liquid phases arise in the proximity of the Kitaev limit. While these ordered phases also appear in the monolayer Kitaev-Heisenberg model, our results further show that a valence bond solid state emerges in a relatively narrow range of parameter space between the AFM and stripy phases, which can be adiabatically connected to isolated Heisenberg dimers. Our results highlight the importance of considering interlayer interactions on the emergence of novel quantum phases in the bilayer Kitaev materials.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17495'&gt;arXiv:2412.17495&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 23 Dec 2024 11:53:01 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Advantages of density in tensor network geometries for gradient based training</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17497</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Sergi Masot-Llima, Artur Garcia-Saez&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Tensor networks are a very powerful data structure tool originating from quantum system simulations. In recent years, they have seen increased use in machine learning, mostly in trainings with gradient-based techniques, due to their flexibility and performance exploiting hardware acceleration. As ansätze, tensor networks can be used with flexible geometries, and it is known that for highly regular ones their dimensionality has a large impact in performance and representation power. For heterogeneous structures, however, these effects are not completely characterized. In this article, we train tensor networks with different geometries to encode a random quantum state, and see that densely connected structures achieve better infidelities than more sparse structures, with higher success rates and less time. Additionally, we give some general insight on how to improve memory requirements on these sparse structures and its impact on the trainings. Finally, as we use HPC resources for the calculations, we discuss the requirements for this approach and showcase performance improvements with GPU acceleration on a last-generation supercomputer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17497'&gt;arXiv:2412.17497&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 23 Dec 2024 11:54:44 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Field-Induced Magnon Decay, Magnon Shadows, and Roton-like Excitations in the Honeycomb Antiferromagnet YbBr$_3$</title>

Kenzelmann&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Although the search for quantum many-body phenomena in magnetic materials has a strong focus on highly frustrated systems, even unfrustrated quantum magnets show a multitude of unconventional phenomena in their spin excitation spectra. YbBr$_3$ is an excellent realization of the $S = 1/2$ antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model on the honeycomb lattice, and we have performed detailed spectroscopic experiments with both unpolarized and polarized neutrons at all applied magnetic fields up to saturation. We observe extensive excitation continua, which cause strong renormalization and the decay of single magnons at higher fields, while coherent features include field-induced ``shadows'' of the single magnons and the spectacular emergence of a roton-like excitation. To guide and interpret our experiments, we performed systematic calculations by the method of cylinder matrix-product states that provide quantitative agreement with the neutron scattering data and a qualitative benchmark for the spectral signatures of strong quantum fluctuations even in the absence of magnetic frustration.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17720'&gt;arXiv:2412.17720&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 23 Dec 2024 16:59:02 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Variational Quantum Simulation of Anyonic Chains</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17781</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Ananda Roy&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Anyonic chains provide lattice realizations of a rich set of quantum field theories in two space-time dimensions. The latter play a central role in the investigation of generalized symmetries, renormalization group flows and numerous exotic phases of strongly-correlated systems. Here, a variational quantum simulation scheme is presented for the analysis of those anyonic chains which can be mapped to the restricted solid-on-solid~(RSOS) models of Andrews, Baxter and Forrester. An~$L_R$ site RSOS model associated with a Dynkin diagram containing~$p$ nodes is realized with~$L_R\lceil\ln_2 p\rceil$ qubits, where~$\lceil x\rceil$ is the smallest integer~$\geq x$. The scheme is benchmarked by realizing the ground states of RSOS Hamiltonians in the~$A_p$ family for~$4\leq p\leq8$ using a variational quantum-classical algorithm. The latter is based on the Euler-Cartan circuit ansatz. Topological symmetry operators are analyzed for the RSOS models at the quantum-critical points. Measurement of observables acting on~$\lceil\ln_2 p\rceil$ qubits is shown to capture the anyonic nature of the Hilbert space. The described quantum simulation scheme provides a systematic approach to give rise to a large family of quantum field theories which have largely eluded physical realizations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17781'&gt;arXiv:2412.17781&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 23 Dec 2024 18:39:28 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Probing the magnetic origin of the pseudogap using a Fermi-Hubbard quantum simulator</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17801</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Thomas Chalopin, Petar Bojović, Si Wang, Titus Franz, Aritra Sinha, Zhenjiu Wang, Dominik Bourgund, Johannes Obermeyer, Fabian Grusdt, Annabelle Bohrdt, Lode Pollet, Alexander Wietek, Antoine Georges, Timon Hilker, Immanuel Bloch&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; In strongly correlated materials, interacting electrons are entangled and form collective quantum states, resulting in rich low-temperature phase diagrams. Notable examples include cuprate superconductors, in which superconductivity emerges at low doping out of an unusual ``pseudogap'' metallic state above the critical temperature. The Fermi-Hubbard model, describing a wide range of phenomena associated with strong electron correlations, still offers major computational challenges despite its simple formulation. In this context, ultracold atoms quantum simulators have provided invaluable insights into the microscopic nature of correlated quantum states. Here, we use a quantum gas microscope Fermi-Hubbard simulator to explore a wide range of doping levels and temperatures in a regime where a pseudogap is known to develop. By measuring multi-point correlation functions up to fifth order, we uncover a novel universal behaviour in magnetic and higher-order spin-charge correlations. This behaviour is characterized by a doping-dependent energy scale that governs the exponential growth of the magnetic correlation length upon cooling. Accurate comparisons with determinant Quantum Monte Carlo and Minimally Entangled Typical Thermal States simulations confirm that this energy scale agrees well with the pseudogap temperature $T^{*}$. Our findings establish a qualitative and quantitative understanding of the magnetic origin and physical nature of the pseudogap and pave the way towards the exploration of pairing and collective phenomena among charge carriers expected to emerge at lower temperatures.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17801'&gt;arXiv:2412.17801&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 23 Dec 2024 18:58:01 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Practical learning of multi-time statistics in open quantum systems</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17862</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Gregory A. L. White, Lloyd C. L. Hollenberg, Charles D. Hill, Kavan Modi&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Randomised measurements can efficiently characterise many-body quantum states by learning the expectation values of observables with low Pauli weights. In this paper, we generalise the theoretical tools of classical shadow tomography to the temporal domain to explore multi-time phenomena. This enables us to efficiently learn the features of multi-time processes such as correlated error rates, multi-time non-Markovianity, and temporal entanglement. We test the efficacy of these tools on a noisy quantum processor to characterise its noise features. Implementing these tools requires mid-circuit instruments, typically slow or unavailable in current quantum hardware. We devise a protocol to achieve fast and reliable instruments such that these multi-time distributions can be learned to a high accuracy. This enables a compact matrix product operator representation of large processes allowing us to showcase a reconstructed 20-step process (whose naive dimensionality is that of a 42-qubit state). Our techniques are pertinent to generic quantum stochastic dynamical processes, with a scope ranging across condensed matter physics, quantum biology, and in-depth diagnostics of noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17862'&gt;arXiv:2412.17862&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 20 Dec 2024 18:46:18 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Interaction-induced inversion of chiral transports</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18451</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Li Pan, Qian Liang, Chang-An Yang, Yu Huang, Pengjie Liu, Fanying Xi, Wei Yi, Xiaofan Zhou, Jian-Song Pan&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We study the chiral transport of interacting bosons in a two-leg flux ladder with on-site interactions. Focusing on the flux-induced chiral current along the two legs, we show that, counter-intuitively, on-site interactions can reverse the direction of the chiral flow. For a Bose-Einstein condensate whose dynamical evolution is driven by the Gross-Pitaevskii equation under the mean-field approximation, this reversal can be understood as an interaction-induced dynamic occupation inversion, under which single-particle band with opposing chirality becomes heavily populated in the dynamics. This chirality inversion also persists in the two-body dynamics with strong quantum fluctuations beyond the mean-field regime, as demonstrated through time-dependent density-matrix renormalization group and exact diagonalization analyses. Herein, besides the band-occupation-inversion mechanism, we find that the formation of two-body bound states with opposite chirality contributes significantly to the reversed chiral transport. Our discovery highlights the significance of correlation effects in quantum transport, and can be readily demonstrated using cold atoms.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18451'&gt;arXiv:2412.18451&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 24 Dec 2024 14:22:02 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Probing Entanglement Scaling Across a Quantum Phase Transition on a Quantum Computer</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18602</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Qiang Miao, Tianyi Wang, Kenneth R. Brown, Thomas Barthel, Marko Cetina&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The investigation of strongly-correlated quantum matter is difficult due to the curse of dimensionality and intricate entanglement structures. These challenges are particularly pronounced in the vicinity of continuous quantum phase transitions, where quantum fluctuations manifest across all length scales. While quantum simulators give controlled access to a number of strongly correlated systems, the study of critical phenomena has been hampered by finite-size effects arising from diverging correlation lengths. Moreover, the experimental investigation of entanglement in many-body systems has been hindered by limitations in measurement protocols. To address these challenges, we employ the multiscale entanglement renormalization ansatz (MERA) and implement a holographic scheme for subsystem tomography on a fully-connected trapped-ion quantum computer. Our method accurately represents infinite systems and long-range correlations with few qubits, facilitating the efficient extraction of observables and entanglement properties, even at criticality. We observe a quantum phase transition with spontaneous symmetry breaking and reveal the evolution of entanglement properties across the critical point. For the first time, we demonstrate log-law scaling of subsystem entanglement entropies at criticality on a digital quantum computer. This achievement highlights the potential of MERA for the investigation of strongly-correlated many-body systems on quantum computers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18602'&gt;arXiv:2412.18602&lt;/a&gt;] Published Tue, 24 Dec 2024 18:56:44 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Emergent Intermediate Phase in the $J_1$-$J_2$ XY model from Tensor Network Approaches</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18892</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Feng-Feng Song, Hanggai Nuomin, Naoki Kawashima&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We investigate the finite-temperature phase diagram of the classical $J_1$-$J_2$ XY model on a square lattice using a tensor network approach designed for frustrated spin systems. This model, characterized by competing nearest-neighbor and next-to-nearest-neighbor interactions, exhibits a complex interplay between $U(1)$ and $Z_2$ symmetries. Our study reveals an emergent intermediate phase around $J_2/J_1 \sim 0.505$, which is characterized by a $Z_2$ long-range stripe order without phase coherence in the XY spins. The intermediate phase features two well-separated phase transitions: a higher-temperature Ising transition and a lower-temperature Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition. The relative separation between these transitions is significantly larger than previously reported, enabling a clearer investigation of their distinct thermodynamic properties. For $0.5&lt;J_2/J_1 &lt; 0.501$, two transitions merge into a single first-order phase transition, a phenomenon that cannot be explained solely by mapping to the Ising-XY model. As $J_2/J_1 \to \infty$, the transition evolves continuously into the BKT universality class. These findings advance the understanding of the mechanisms driving phase transitions in frustrated spin systems and suggest potential experimental realizations in platforms such as ultracold atoms, Josephson junction arrays, and optical lattices.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18892'&gt;arXiv:2412.18892&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 25 Dec 2024 12:51:07 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

Yelin, Hannes Pichler, Mikhail Lukin&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Efficiently estimating large numbers of non-commuting observables is an important subroutine of many quantum science tasks. We present the derandomized shallow shadows (DSS) algorithm for efficiently learning a large set of non-commuting observables, using shallow circuits to rotate into measurement bases. Exploiting tensor network techniques to ensure polynomial scaling of classical resources, our algorithm outputs a set of shallow measurement circuits that approximately minimizes the sample complexity of estimating a given set of Pauli strings. We numerically demonstrate systematic improvement, in comparison with state-of-the-art techniques, for energy estimation of quantum chemistry benchmarks and verification of quantum many-body systems, and we observe DSS's performance consistently improves as one allows deeper measurement circuits. These results indicate that in addition to being an efficient, low-depth, stand-alone algorithm, DSS can also benefit many larger quantum algorithms requiring estimation of multiple non-commuting observables.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18973'&gt;arXiv:2412.18973&lt;/a&gt;] Published Wed, 25 Dec 2024 19:23:29 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Quantum Cluster State Model with Haagerup Fusion Category Symmetry</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19657</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Zhian Jia&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We propose a (1+1)D lattice model, inspired by a weak Hopf algebra generalization of the cluster state model, which realizes Haagerup fusion category symmetry and features a tensor product Hilbert space. The construction begins with a reconstruction of the Haagerup weak Hopf algebra $H_3$ from the Haagerup fusion category, ensuring that the representation category of $H_3$ is equivalent to Haagerup fusion category. Utilizing the framework of symmetry topological field theory (SymTFT), we develop an ultra-thin weak Hopf quantum double model, characterized by a smooth topological boundary condition. We show that this model supports Haagerup fusion category symmetry. Finally, we solve the ground state of the model in terms of a weak Hopf matrix product state, which serves as a natural generalization of the cluster state, embodying Haagerup fusion category symmetry.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19657'&gt;arXiv:2412.19657&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 27 Dec 2024 14:05:15 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Tensor Network Estimation of Distribution Algorithms</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19780</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; John Gardiner, Javier Lopez-Piqueres&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Tensor networks are a tool first employed in the context of many-body quantum physics that now have a wide range of uses across the computational sciences, from numerical methods to machine learning. Methods integrating tensor networks into evolutionary optimization algorithms have appeared in the recent literature. In essence, these methods can be understood as replacing the traditional crossover operation of a genetic algorithm with a tensor network-based generative model. We investigate these methods from the point of view that they are Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs). We find that optimization performance of these methods is not related to the power of the generative model in a straightforward way. Generative models that are better (in the sense that they better model the distribution from which their training data is drawn) do not necessarily result in better performance of the optimization algorithm they form a part of. This raises the question of how best to incorporate powerful generative models into optimization routines. In light of this we find that adding an explicit mutation operator to the output of the generative model often improves optimization performance.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19780'&gt;arXiv:2412.19780&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 27 Dec 2024 18:22:47 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Transmon qutrit-based simulation of spin-1 AKLT systems</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19786</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Keerthi Kumaran, Faisal Alam, Norhan Eassa, Kaelyn Ferris, Xiao Xiao, Lukasz Cincio, Nicholas Bronn, Arnab Banerjee&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Qutrit-based quantum circuits could help reduce the overall circuit depths, and hence the effect of noise, when the system of interest has a local dimension of three. Accessing second excited states in superconducting transmons provides a straightforward hardware realization of qutrits useful for such ternary encoding. In this work, we successfully calibrate microwave pulse gates to a low error rate to operate transmon qutrits. We use these qutrits to simulate one-dimensional spin-1 AKLT states (Affleck, Kennedy, Lieb, and Tasaki), which exhibit a multitude of interesting phenomena, such as topologically protected ground states, string order, and the existence of a robust Berry phase. We demonstrate the efficacy of qutrit-based simulation by preparing high-fidelity ground states of the AKLT Hamiltonian with open boundaries for various chain lengths. We then use ground state preparations of the perturbed AKLT Hamiltonian with periodic boundaries to calculate the Berry phase and illustrate non-trivial ground state topology. To establish the advantage of qutrits over qubits in the presence of noise, we present scalable methods for preparing the AKLT state and computing its Berry phase using tensor network simulations. Our work provides a pathway toward more general spin-1 physics simulations using transmon qutrits, with applications in chemistry, magnetism, and topological phases of matter.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19786'&gt;arXiv:2412.19786&lt;/a&gt;] Published Fri, 27 Dec 2024 18:32:39 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Quantum Transport in Interacting Spin Chains: Exact Derivation of the GUE Tracy-Widom Distribution</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Kazuya Fujimoto, Tomohiro Sasamoto&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We theoretically study quantum spin transport in a one-dimensional folded XXZ model with an alternating domain-wall initial state via the Bethe ansatz technique, exactly demonstrating that a probability distribution of finding a left-most up-spin with an appropriate scaling variable converges to the Tracy-Widom distribution for the Gaussian unitary ensemble (GUE), which is a universal distribution for the largest eigenvalue of GUE under a soft-edge scaling limit. Our finding presented here offers a first exact derivation of the GUE Tracy-Widom distribution in the dynamics of the interacting quantum model not being mapped to a noninteracting fermion Hamiltonian via the Jordan-Wigner transformation. On the basis of the exact solution of the folded XXZ model and our numerical analysis of the XXZ model, we discuss a universal behavior for the probability of finding the left-most up-spin in the XXZ model.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20147'&gt;arXiv:2412.20147&lt;/a&gt;] Published Sat, 28 Dec 2024 13:15:12 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Entanglement as a topological marker in harmonically confined attractive Fermi-Hubbard chains</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20515</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Marina Sanino, Isaac Carvalho, Vivian França&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We investigate the single-site von Neumann entropy along a harmonically confined superfluid chain, as described by the one-dimensional fermionic Hubbard model with strongly attractive interactions. We find that by increasing the confinement (or equivalently the particle filling) the system undergoes a quantum phase transition from a superfluid (SF) to a non-trivial topological insulator (TI) phase, which is characterized by an insulating bulk surrounded by highly entangled superfluid edges. These highly entangled states are found to be robust against perturbations and topologically protected by the particle-hole symmetry, which is locally preserved. We also find a semi-quantitative agreement between entanglement and superconducting order parameter profiles, confirming then that entanglement can be used as a topological marker and an order parameter in these systems. The charge gap not only confirms the SF-TI transition, but also shows that this transition is mediated by a metallic intermediate regime within the bulk. Using the gap we could depict a phase diagram for which the non-trivial topological insulator can be found in such harmonically confined attractive systems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20515'&gt;arXiv:2412.20515&lt;/a&gt;] Published Sun, 29 Dec 2024 16:22:44 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Non-invertible SPTs: an on-site realization of (1+1)d anomaly-free fusion category symmetry</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20546</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Chenqi Meng, Xinping Yang, Tian Lan, Zhengcheng Gu&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We investigate (1+1)d symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases with fusion category symmetries. We emphasize that the UV description of an anomaly-free fusion category symmetry must include the fiber functor, giving rise to a local symmetry action, a charge category and a trivial phase. We construct an ``onsite'' matrix-product-operator (MPO) version of the Hopf algebra symmetry operators in a lattice model with tensor-product Hilbert space. In particular, we propose a systematic framework for classifying and constructing SPTs with non-invertible symmetries. An SPT phase corresponds to a Q-system in the charge category, such that the Q-system becomes a matrix algebra when the symmetry is forgotten. As an example, we provide an explicit microscopic realization of all three $\mathsf{Rep}^\dagger(D_8)$ SPT phases, including a trivial phase, and further demonstrate the $S_3$-duality among these three SPT phases.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20546'&gt;arXiv:2412.20546&lt;/a&gt;] Published Sun, 29 Dec 2024 18:34:34 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Symmetry-enforced minimal entanglement and correlation in quantum spin chains</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20765</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Kangle Li, Liujun Zou&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The interplay between symmetry, entanglement and correlation is an interesting and important topic in quantum many-body physics. Within the framework of matrix product states, in this paper we study the minimal entanglement and correlation enforced by the $SO(3)$ spin rotation symmetry and lattice translation symmetry in a quantum spin-$J$ chain, with $J$ a positive integer. When neither symmetry is spontaneously broken, for a sufficiently long segment in a sufficiently large closed chain, we find that the minimal Rényi-$\alpha$ entropy compatible with these symmetries is $\min\{ -\frac{2}{\alpha-1}\ln(\frac{1}{2^\alpha}({1+\frac{1}{(2J+1)^{\alpha-1}}})), 2\ln(J+1) \}$, for any $\alpha\in\mathbb{R}^+$. In an infinitely long open chain with such symmetries, for any $\alpha\in\mathbb{R}^+$ the minimal Rényi-$\alpha$ entropy of half of the system is $\min\{ -\frac{1}{\alpha-1}\ln(\frac{1}{2^\alpha}({1+\frac{1}{(2J+1)^{\alpha-1}}})), \ln(J+1) \}$. When $\alpha\rightarrow 1$, these lower bounds give the symmetry-enforced minimal von Neumann entropies in these setups. Moreover, we show that no state in a quantum spin-$J$ chain with these symmetries can have a vanishing correlation length. Interestingly, the states with the minimal entanglement may not be a state with the minimal correlation length.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20765'&gt;arXiv:2412.20765&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 30 Dec 2024 07:22:18 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Parametrized topological phases in 1d and T-duality</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20905</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Roman Geiko&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; There are families of physical systems that cannot be adiabatically evolved to the trivial system uniformly across the parameter space, even if each system in the family belongs to the trivial phase. The obstruction is measured by higher Berry class. We analyze families of topological systems in 1+1d using families of invertible TQFTs and families of RG fixed states of spin chains. We use the generalized matrix-product states to describe RG fixed points of all translation invariant pure splits states on spin chains. Families of such fixed points correspond to bundles of Hilbert-Schmidt operators. There exists a global MPS parametrization of the family if and only if the latter bundle is trivial. We propose a novel duality of parametrized topological phases which is an avatar of the T-duality in string theory. The duality relates families with different parameter spaces and different higher Berry classes. Mathematically, the T-duality is realized by gauging the circle action on the continuous trace algebra generated by parametrized matrix-product tensors.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20905'&gt;arXiv:2412.20905&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 30 Dec 2024 12:33:28 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>Effects of alternating interactions and boundary conditions on quantum entanglement of three-leg Heisenberg ladder</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20935</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Qinghui Li, Lizhen Hu, Panpan Zhang, Chuanzheng Miao, Yuliang Xu, Zhongqiang Liu, Xiangmu Kong&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; The spin-12 three-leg antiferromagnetic Heisenberg spin ladder is studied under open boundary condition (OBC) and cylinder boundary condition (CBC), using the density matrix renormalization group and matrix product state methods, respectively. Specifically, we calculate the energy density, entanglement entropy, and concurrence while discussing the effects of interleg interaction J2 and the alternating coupling parameter gamma on these quantities. It is found that the introduction of gamma can completely reverse the concurrence distribution between odd and even bonds. Under CBC, the generation of the interleg concurrence is inhibited when gamma=0, and the introduction of gamma can cause interleg concurrence between chains 1 and 3, in which the behavior is more complicated due to the competition between CBC and gamma. Additionally, we find that gamma induces two types of long-distance entanglement (LDE) in the system under OBC: intraleg LDE and inter-leg one. When the system size is sufficiently large, both types of LDE reach similar strength and stabilize at a constant value. The study indicates that the three-leg ladder makes it easier to generate LDE compared with the two-leg system. However, the generation of LDE is inhibited under CBC which the spin frustration exists. In addition, the calculated results of energy, entanglement entropy and concurrence all show that there are essential relations between these quantities and phase transitions of the system. Further, we predict a phase transition point near gamma=0.54 under OBC. The present study provides valuable insights into understanding the phase diagram of this class of systems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20935'&gt;arXiv:2412.20935&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 30 Dec 2024 13:26:23 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>The surface code beyond Pauli channels: Logical noise coherence, information-theoretic measures, and errorfield-double phenomenology</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21055</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Author(s):&lt;/b&gt; Jan Behrends, Benjamin Béri&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We consider the surface code under errors featuring both coherent and incoherent components and study the coherence of the corresponding logical noise channel and how this impacts information-theoretic measures of code performance, namely coherent information and quantum relative entropy. Using numerical simulations and a phenomenological field theory, focusing on the most general single-qubit X-error channel, we show that, for any nonzero incoherent noise component, the coherence of the logical noise is exponentially suppressed with the code distance. We also find that the information-theoretic measures require this suppression to detect optimal thresholds for Pauli recovery; they thus require increasingly large distances for increasing error coherence and ultimately break down for fully coherent errors. To obtain our results, we develop a statistical mechanics mapping and a corresponding matrix-product-state algorithm for approximate syndrome sampling. These methods enable the large-scale simulation of these non-Pauli errors, including their maximum-likelihood thresholds, away from the limits captured by previous approaches.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21055'&gt;arXiv:2412.21055&lt;/a&gt;] Published Mon, 30 Dec 2024 16:14:55 UTC&lt;/b&gt;</description>
