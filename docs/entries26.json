      "title": "Magnetic field-induced phases in a model S=1 Haldane chain system",
      "abstract": "An $S=1$ Haldane chain is a one-dimensional (1D) quantum magnet where strong fluctuations result in quantum disordered singlet ground state with a gapped excitation spectrum. The gap magnitude is primarily set by the dominant intrachain interaction ($J_\\text{1D}$). An applied magnetic field closes the gap at $B_\\text{c1}$ and drives the system into a gapless Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid (TLL) regime, followed by, at lower temperatures, a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) ground state, persisting up to $B_\\text{c2} \\propto 4 J_\\text{1D}/gμ_B$. Almost all previously studied experimental realizations of such systems were based on transition-metal complexes which typically suffer from intrinsic anisotropies or large $J_\\text{1D}$ values, limiting the access to the full theoretical phase diagram. We report a comprehensive study of TLL and BEC phases in the organic Haldane chain system 3,5-bis(N-tert-butylaminoxyl)-3'-nitrobiphenyl (BoNO). The absence of anisotropy and a moderate $J_\\text{1D}$ enable exploration of the complete $B-T$ phase diagram. Through $^1$H nuclear magnetic resonance, combined with theoretical analysis, we characterize the TLL properties, map the BEC phase boundary $T_c (B)$, determine the associated critical exponent $ν\\approx 0.66$ at $B_\\text{c2}$, and demonstrate universal quasiparticle scaling in the quantum-critical regime. These results provide full experimental validation of theoretical predictions for field-induced phases in an $S=1$ Haldane chain, made over two decades ago.",

      "abstract": "We introduce SpinPulse, an open-source python package for simulating spin qubit-based quantum computers at the pulse-level. SpinPulse models the specific physics of spin qubits, particularly through the inclusion of classical non-Markovian noise. This enables realistic simulations of native gates and quantum circuits, in order to support hardware development. In SpinPulse, a quantum circuit is first transpiled into the native gate set of our model and then converted to a pulse sequence. This pulse sequence is subsequently integrated numerically in the presence of a simulated noisy experimental environment. We showcase workflows including transpilation, pulse-level compilation, hardware benchmarking, quantum error mitigation, and large-scale simulations via integration with the tensor-network library quimb. We expect SpinPulse to be a valuable open-source tool for the quantum computing community, fostering efforts to devise high-fidelity quantum circuits and improved strategies for quantum error mitigation and correction.",

      "title": "Quantitative approach for the Dicke-Ising chain with an effective self-consistent matter Hamiltonian",
      "abstract": "In the thermodynamic limit, the Dicke-Ising chain maps exactly onto an effective self-consistent matter Hamiltonian with the photon field acting solely as a self-consistent effective field. As a consequence, no quantum correlations between photons and spins are needed to understand the quantum phase diagram. This enables us to determine the quantum phase diagram in the thermodynamic limit using numerical linked-cluster expansions combined with density matrix renormalization group calculations (NLCE+DMRG) to solve the resulting self-consistent matter Hamiltonian. This includes magnetically ordered phases with significantly improved accuracy compared to previous estimates. For ferromagnetic Ising couplings, we refine the location of the multicritical point governing the change in the order of the superradiant phase transition, reaching a relative accuracy of $10^{-4}$. For antiferromagnetic Ising couplings, we confirm the existence of the narrow antiferromagnetic superradiant phase in the thermodynamic limit. The effective matter Hamiltonian framework identifies the antiferromagnetic superradiant phase as the many-body ground state of an antiferromagnetic transverse-field Ising model with longitudinal field. This phase emerges through continuous Dicke-type polariton condensation from the antiferromagnetic normal phase, followed by a first-order transition to the paramagnetic superradiant phase. Thus, NLCE+DMRG provides a precise determination of the Dicke-Ising phase diagram in one dimension by solving the self-consistent effective matter Hamiltonian.",

      "abstract": "We demonstrate that large language model (LLM) agents can autonomously perform tensor network simulations of quantum many-body systems, achieving approximately 90% success rate across representative benchmark tasks. Tensor network methods are powerful tools for quantum simulation, but their effective use requires expertise typically acquired through years of graduate training. By combining in-context learning with curated documentation and multi-agent decomposition, we create autonomous AI agents that can be trained in specialized computational domains within minutes. We benchmark three configurations (baseline, single-agent with in-context learning, and multi-agent with in-context learning) on problems spanning quantum phase transitions, open quantum system dynamics, and photochemical reactions. Systematic evaluation using DeepSeek-V3.2, Gemini 2.5 Pro, and Claude Opus 4.5 demonstrates that both in-context learning and multi-agent architecture are essential. Analysis of failure modes reveals characteristic patterns across models, with the multi-agent configuration substantially reducing implementation errors and hallucinations compared to simpler architectures.",

      "title": "Privacy Enhanced PEFT: Tensor Train Decomposition Improves Privacy Utility Tradeoffs under DP-SGD",
      "abstract": "Fine-tuning large language models on sensitive data poses significant privacy risks, as membership inference attacks can reveal whether individual records were used during training. While Differential Privacy (DP) provides formal protection, applying DP to conventional Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) often incurs substantial utility loss. In this work, we show that a more structurally constrained PEFT architecture, Tensor Train Low-Rank Adaptation (TTLoRA), can improve the privacy-utility tradeoff by shrinking the effective parameter space while preserving expressivity. To this end, we develop TTLoRA-DP, a differentially private training framework for TTLoRA. Specifically, we extend the ghost clipping algorithm to Tensor Train cores via cached contraction states, enabling efficient Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent (DP-SGD) with exact per-example gradient norm computation without materializing full per-example gradients. Experiments on GPT-2 fine-tuning over the Enron and Penn Treebank datasets show that TTLoRA-DP consistently strengthens privacy protection relative to LoRA-DP while maintaining comparable or better downstream utility. Moreover, TTLoRA exhibits lower membership leakage even without DP training, using substantially smaller adapters and requiring on average 7.6X fewer parameters than LoRA. Overall, our results demonstrate that TTLoRA offers a practical path to improving the privacy-utility tradeoff in parameter-efficient language model adaptation.",

The numerical results from a tensor network calculation on a finite lattice confirm the expectation from infinite-system analytics, that a gapped phase with spontaneously broken time-reversal symmetry emerges when the Fermi level is tuned to the Dirac point and the Luttinger parameter crosses a critical value.",

      "abstract": "Studying finite-temperature properties with tensor networks is notoriously difficult, especially at low temperatures, due to the rapid growth of entanglement and the complexity of thermal states. Existing methods like purification and minimally entangled typical thermal states offer partial solutions but struggle with scalability and accuracy in low-temperature regime. To overcome these limitations, we propose a new approach based on generating-function matrix product states (GFMPS). By directly computing a large set of Bloch-type excited states, we construct Gibbs states that moderate the area-law constraint, enabling accurate and efficient approximation of low-temperature thermal behavior. Our benchmark results show magnificent agreement with both exact diagonalization and experimental observations, validating the accuracy of our approach. This method offers a promising new direction for overcoming the longstanding challenges of studying low-temperature properties within the tensor network framework. We also expect that our method will facilitate the numerical simulation of quantum materials in comparison with experimental observations.",

      "abstract": "We construct 2+1-dimensional lattice models of symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases with non-invertible symmetries and investigate their properties using tensor networks. These models, which we refer to as generalized cluster models, are constructed by gauging a subgroup symmetry $H \\subset G$ in models with a finite group 0-form symmetry $G$. By construction, these models have a non-invertible symmetry described by the group-theoretical fusion 2-category $\\mathcal{C}(G; H)$. After identifying the tensor network representations of the symmetry operators, we study the symmetry acting on the interface between two generalized cluster states. In particular, we will see that the symmetry at the interface is described by a multifusion category known as the strip 2-algebra. By studying possible interface modes allowed by this symmetry, we show that the interface between generalized cluster states in different SPT phases must be degenerate. This result generalizes the ordinary bulk-boundary correspondence. Furthermore, we construct parameterized families of generalized cluster states and study the topological charge pumping phenomena, known as the generalized Thouless pump. We exemplify our construction with several concrete cases, and compare them with known phases, such as SPT phases with $2\\mathrm{Rep}((\\mathbb{Z}_{2}^{[1]}\\times\\mathbb{Z}_{2}^{[1]})\\rtimes\\mathbb{Z}_{2}^{[0]})$ symmetry.",

      "abstract": "Tensor network states are an indispensable tool for the simulation of strongly correlated quantum many-body systems. In recent years, tree tensor network states (TTNS) have been successfully used for two-dimensional systems and to benchmark quantum simulation approaches for condensed matter, nuclear, and particle physics. In comparison to the more traditional approach based on matrix product states (MPS), the graph distance of physical degrees of freedom can be drastically reduced in TTNS. Surprisingly, it turns out that, for large systems in $D>1$ spatial dimensions, MPS simulations of low-energy states are nevertheless more efficient than TTNS simulations. With a focus on $D=2$ and 3, the scaling of computational costs for different boundary conditions is determined under the assumption that the system obeys an entanglement (log-)area law, implying that bond dimensions scale exponentially in the surface area of the associated subsystems.",

In this work, we present the first tensor-network study of the paradigmatic interface roughening transition of the 3-D Ising model using highly asymmetric lattices that are infinite in the $(xy)$ direction and finite in $z$. By reducing the problem to an effective 2-D tensor network, we study how truncating the $z$ direction reshapes the physics of the interface. For a truncation based on open boundary conditions, we demonstrate that varying the interface width gives rise to either a $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry breaking transition (for odd $L_z$) or a smooth crossover(for even $L_z$). For antiperiodic boundary conditions, we obtain an effective $\\mathbb{Z}_q$ clock model description with $q=2L_z$ that exhibits an intermediate Luttinger liquid phase with an emergent $\\U(1)$ symmetry.",

      "abstract": "Accurately describing strongly correlated electronic systems remains a central challenge in quantum chemistry, as electron-electron interactions give rise to complex many-body wavefunctions that are difficult to capture with conventional approximations. Classical wavefunction-based approaches, such as the Semistochastic Heat-bath Configuration Interaction (SHCI) and the Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG), currently define the state of the art, systematically converging toward the Full Configuration Interaction (FCI) limit, but at a rapidly increasing computational cost. Quantum computing algorithms promise to alleviate this scaling bottleneck by leveraging entanglement and superposition to represent correlated states more compactly. We introduced the Handover-Iterative Variational Quantum Eigensolver (HI-VQE) as a practical quantum computing algorithm with an iterative \"handover\" mechanism that dynamically exchanges information between quantum and classical computers, even using Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) computers. In this work, we extend the HI-VQE to benchmark two prototypical strongly correlated systems, the nitrogen molecule $N_2$ and iron-sulfur (Fe-S) cluster, which serve as stringent tests for both classical and quantum electronic-structure methods. By comparing HI-VQE results against Heat-bath Configuration Interaction (HCI) benchmarks, we assess its accuracy, scalability, and ability to capture multireference correlation effects. Achieving quantitative agreement on these canonical systems demonstrates a viable pathway toward quantum-enhanced simulations of complex bioinorganic molecules, catalytic mechanisms, and correlated materials.",

      "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) can be adapted to new tasks using parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods that modify only a small number of trainable parameters, often through low-rank updates. In this work, we adopt a quantum-information-inspired perspective to understand their effectiveness. From this perspective, low-rank parameterizations naturally correspond to low-dimensional Matrix Product States (MPS) representations, which enable entanglement-based characterizations of parameter structure. Thereby, we term and measure \"Artificial Entanglement\", defined as the entanglement entropy of the parameters in artificial neural networks (in particular the LLMs). We first study the representative low-rank adaptation (LoRA) PEFT method, alongside full fine-tuning (FFT), using LLaMA models at the 1B and 8B scales trained on the Tulu3 and OpenThoughts3 datasets, and uncover: (i) Internal artificial entanglement in the updates of query and value projection matrices in LoRA follows a volume law with a central suppression (termed as the \"Entanglement Valley\"), which is sensitive to hyper-parameters and is distinct from that in FFT; (ii) External artificial entanglement in attention matrices, corresponding to token-token correlations in representation space, follows an area law with logarithmic corrections and remains robust to LoRA hyper-parameters and training steps. Drawing a parallel to the No-Hair Theorem in black hole physics, we propose that although LoRA and FFT induce distinct internal entanglement signatures, such differences do not manifest in the attention outputs, suggesting a \"no-hair\" property that results in the effectiveness of low rank updates. We further provide theoretical support based on random matrix theory, and extend our analysis to an MPS Adaptation PEFT method, which exhibits qualitatively similar behaviors.",

We argue that one-dimensional electron channels formed in the silicon quantum well of a Si/SiGe heterostructure exhibit strong Coulomb interactions and realize strongly interacting Luttinger liquid physics. At low electron densities, the system enters a Wigner regime characterized by dominant 4kF correlations; increasing the electron density leads to a crossover from the Wigner regime to a Friedel regime with dominant 2kF correlations. We support these results through large-scale density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations of the interacting ground state under both screened and unscreened Coulomb potentials. We propose experimental signatures of the Wigner-Friedel crossover via charge transport and charge sensing in both zero- and high-magnetic field limits. We also analyze the impact of short-range correlated disorder - including random alloy fluctuations and valley splitting variations - and identify that the Wigner-Friedel crossover remains robust until disorder levels of about 400 micro eV. Finally, we show that the Wigner regime enables long-range capacitive coupling between quantum dots across the interconnect, suggesting a route to create long-range entanglement between solid-state qubits. Our results position silicon interconnects as a platform for studying Luttinger liquid physics and for enabling architectures supporting nonlocal quantum error correction and quantum simulation.",

      "title": "Chiral Graviton Modes in Fermionic Fractional Chern Insulators",
      "abstract": "Chiral graviton modes are hallmark collective excitations of Fractional Quantum Hall (FQH) liquids. However, their existence on the lattice, where continuum symmetries that protect them from decay are lost, is still an open and urgent question, especially considering the recent advances in the realization of Fractional Chern Insulators (FCI) in transition metal dichalcogenides and rhombohedral pentalayer graphene. Here we present a comprehensive theoretical and numerical study of graviton-modes in fermionic FCI, and thoroughly demonstrate their existence. We first derive a lattice stress tensor operator in the context of the fermionic Harper-Hofstadter(HH) model which captures the graviton in the flat band limit. Importantly, we discover that such lattice stress-tensor operators are deeply connected to lattice quadrupolar density correlators, readily generalizable to generic Chern bands. We then explicitly show the adiabatic connection between FQH and FCI chiral graviton modes by interpolating from a low flux HH model to a Checkerboard lattice model that hosts a topological flat band. In particular, using state-of-the-art matrix product state and exact diagonalization simulations, we provide strong evidence that chiral graviton modes are long-lived excitations in FCIs despite the lack of continuous symmetries and the scattering with a two-magnetoroton continuum. By means of a careful finite-size analysis, we show that the lattice generates a finite but small intrinsic decay rate for the graviton mode. We discuss the relevance of our results for the exploration of graviton modes in FCI phases realized in solid state settings, as well as cold atom experiments.",

      "title": "Simulation of noisy quantum circuits using frame representations",
      "abstract": "One of the core research questions in the theory of quantum computing is to find out to what precise extent the classical simulation of a noisy quantum circuits is possible and where potential quantum advantages can set in. In this work, we introduce a unified framework for the classical simulation of quantum circuits based on frame theory, encompassing and generalizing a broad class of existing simulation strategies. Within this framework, the computational cost of a simulation algorithm is determined by the one-norm of an associated quasi-probability distribution, providing a common quantitative measure across different simulation approaches. This enables a comprehensive perspective on common methods for the simulation of noisy circuits based on different quantum resources, such as entanglement or non-stabilizerness. It further provides a clear scheme for generating novel classical simulation algorithms. Indeed, by exploring different choices of frames within this formalism and resorting to tools of convex optimization, we are able not only to obtain new insights and improved bounds for existing methods -- such as stabilizer state simulation or Pauli back-propagation -- but also to discover a new approach with an improved performance based on a generalization of the Pauli frame. We, thereby, show that classical simulation techniques can directly benefit from a perspective -- that of frames -- that goes beyond the traditional classification of quantum resources.",

      "abstract": "Quantum impurities can host exotic many-body states that serve as sensitive probes of bath correlations. However, quantitative and non-perturbative methods for determining impurity thermodynamics in such settings remain scarce. Here, we introduce an impurity renormalization group approach that merges the tensor-network representation with the numerical renormalization group cutoff scheme. This method overcomes conventional limitations by treating bath correlations and impurity interactions on an equal footing. Applying our approach to the finite-temperature quantum critical regime of quantum spin systems, we uncover striking impurity-induced phenomena. In a coupled Heisenberg ladder, the impurity triggers a fractionalization of the local magnetic moment. Moreover, the derivative of the impurity susceptibility develops cusps that mark the crossover into the quantum critical regime. We also observe an exotic evolution of the spin correlation function driven by the interplay between bath correlations and the impurity. Our results demonstrate that this method can efficiently solve correlated systems with defects, opening new pathways to discovering novel impurity physics beyond those in non-interacting thermal baths.",

To optimize the scale up in computation across multiple nodes we implement a task based parallelization scheme to demonstrate parallelized gate contraction for wide quantum circuits with many gates per layer. Through the integration of the TAMM framework with Matrix Product State (MPS) tensor network approaches, we deliver a simulation environment that can scale from local systems to HPC clusters. We demonstrate an MPS tensor network simulator running on the state-of-the-art Perlmutter (NVIDIA) supercomputer and discuss the potential portability of this software to HPC clusters such as Frontier (AMD) and Aurora (Intel).

Using tree tensor network simulations, we benchmark the performance of this quantum simulator through near- and far-from-equilibrium observables, showing excellent agreement with the ideal gauge theory.

Understanding its microscopic dynamics in higher spatial dimensions is currently a major challenge and research thrust. Recent advances in numerical techniques allow for the extraction of related signatures in tractable systems in two spatial dimensions over intermediate timescales. Here, we focus on the $2+1$D quantum Ising model, where a longitudinal field is used to energetically separate the two $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry-broken ferromagnetic ground states, turning them into a ``true'' and ``false'' vacuum. Using tree tensor networks, we simulate the microscopic dynamics of a spin-down domain in a spin-up background after a homogeneous quench, with parameters chosen so that the domain corresponds to a bubble of the true vacuum in a false-vacuum background. Our study identifies how the ultimate fate of the bubble -- indefinite expansion or collapse -- depends on its geometrical features and on the microscopic parameters of the Ising Hamiltonian. We further provide a realistic quantum-simulation scheme, aimed at probing bubble dynamics on atomic Rydberg arrays.",

When combined with our integral decimation algorithm, SPC facilitates the accurate compression of cyclic tensor networks with continuous degrees of freedom. To benchmark and illustrate the methods, we compute the absolute thermodynamics of $q$-state clock models on two-dimensional square lattices and an XY model on a Watts-Strogatz graph, which is a small-world network with random connectivity between spins.",

      "abstract": "Tensor Train (TT) decompositions provide a powerful framework to compress grid-structured data, such as sampled function values, on regular Cartesian grids. Such high compression, in turn, enables efficient high-dimensional computations. Exact TT representations are only available for simple analytic functions. Furthermore, global polynomial or Fourier expansions typically yield TT-ranks that grow proportionally with the number of basis terms. State-of-the-art methods are often prohibitively expensive or fail to recover the underlying low-rank structure. We propose a low-rank TT interpolation framework that, given a TT describing a discrete (scalar-, vector-, or tensor-valued) function on a coarse regular grid with $n$ cores, constructs a finer-scale version of the same function represented by a TT with $n+m$ cores, where the last $m$ cores maintain constant rank. Our method guarantees a $\\ell^{2}$-norm error bound independent of the total number of cores, achieves exponential compression at fixed accuracy, and admits logarithmic complexity with respect of the number of grid points. We validate its performance through numerical experiments, including 1D, 2D, and 3D applications such as: 2D and 3D airfoil mask embeddings, image super-resolution, and synthetic noise fields such as 3D synthetic turbulence. In particular, we generate fractal noise fields directly in TT format with logarithmic complexity and memory.

We present an iterative Grover simulation framework based on matrix product states (MPS) to efficiently simulate large-scale Grover's algorithm. Within the NVIDIA CUDA-Q environment, we compare iterative and common (non-iterative) Grover's circuits across statevector and MPS backends. On the MPS backend at 29 qubits, the iterative Grover's circuit runs about 15x faster than the common (non-iterative) Grover's circuit, and about 3-4x faster than the statevector backend. In sampling experiments, Grover's circuits demonstrate strong low-shot stability: as the qubit number increases beyond 13, a single-shot measurement still closely mirrors the results from 4,096 shots, indicating reliable estimates with minimal sampling and significant potential to cut measurement costs. Overall, an iterative MPS design delivers speed and scalability for Grover's circuit simulation, enabling practical large-scale implementations.",

Here we show that a nontrivial fixed point generically does exist in the $\\textit{complex}$ coupling plane and is described by a complex conformal field theory (CCFT). This CCFT fixed point is generic in the sense that it has a single relevant singlet operator, and is thus expected to arise in any non-Hermitian model with $O(N)$ symmetry upon tuning a single complex parameter. We confirm this prediction numerically by locating the CCFT at $N = 3$ in a non-Hermitian spin-1 antiferromagnetic Heisenberg chain, finding good agreement between the complex central charge and scaling dimensions and those obtained by analytic continuation of real fixed points from $N\\leq 2$. We further construct a realistic Lindbladian for a spin-1 chain whose no-click dynamics are governed by the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian realizing the CCFT. Since the CCFT vacuum is the eigenstate with the smallest decay rate, the system naturally relaxes under dissipative dynamics toward a CFT state, thus providing a route to preparing long-range entangled states through engineered dissipation.",

We demonstrate that the tensor renormalization group (TRG) offers an efficient framework to compute the symmetry-twisted partition functions, which enables us to detect the symmetry-breaking transition and also to study associated critical phenomena. As concrete examples of SSB, we investigate the two-dimensional (2D) classical Ising model and the three-dimensional (3D) classical $O(2)$ nonlinear sigma model, and we identify their critical points solely from the twisted partition function. By employing the finite-size scaling argument, we find the critical temperature $T_c=2.2017(2)$ with the critical exponent $ν= 0.663(33)$ for the 3D $O(2)$ model.

We employ tensor network methods to study such dynamics using interacting scalar and gauge theories in 1+1 spacetime dimensions, subject to a quench modeling a homogeneously expanding gravitational background. The models considered are the scalar $λφ^4$ theory and the Schwinger model, i.e. a Dirac fermion coupled to a $U(1)$ gauge field which is equivalent via bosonization to a scalar field with a cosine self-interaction. In the free scalar limit, both theories reproduce known analytical results, providing a nontrivial numerical validation of bosonization in curved spacetime for the Schwinger model. Our central finding is that self-interactions lead to a suppression of gravitational particle production compared to the free-field case, as evidenced by two-point functions and the spectra of produced particles. We further examine the behavior of entanglement generation and find that interactions suppress entanglement growth in the $λφ^4$ theory, while in the Schwinger model, the interplay between suppressed particle production and enhanced inter-particle correlations leads to more complex entanglement behavior. Our results pave the way for further explorations of nonperturbative quantum real-time dynamics of interacting scalar and gauge theories in arbitrary gravitational backgrounds.",

      "abstract": "The study of quantum and classical correlations between subsystems is fundamental to understanding many-body physics. In quantum information theory, the quantum mutual information, $I(A;B)$, is a measure of correlation between the subsystems $A,B$ in a quantum state, and is defined by the means of the von Neumann entropy: $I\\left(A;B\\right)=S\\left(ρ_{A}\\right)+S\\left(ρ_{B}\\right)-S\\left(ρ_{AB}\\right)$. However, such a computation requires an exponential amount of resources. This is a defining feature of quantum systems, the infamous ``curse of dimensionality'' . Other measures, which are based on Rényi divergences instead of von Neumann entropy, were suggested as alternatives in a recent paper showing them to possess important theoretical features, and making them leading candidates as mutual information measures. In this work, we concentrate on the maximal Rényi divergence. This measure can be shown to be the solution of a generalized eigenvalue problem. To calculate it efficiently for a 1D state represented as a matrix product state, we develop a generalized eigenvalue version of the density matrix renormalization group algorithm. We benchmark our method for the paradigmatic XXZ chain, and show that the maximal Rényi divergence may exhibit different trends than the von Neumann mutual information.",

      "abstract": "Polar antiferromagnetic metals have recently garnered increasing interests due to their combined traits of both ferromagnets and antiferromagnets for spintronic applications. However, the inherently incompatible nature of antiferromagnet, metallicity and polarity pose a significant challenge. We propose that charge disproportionation can lead to this novel state in negative charge transfer gap regime in molecular orbital crystal by molecular orbital analyses of first-principles DFT+$U$ electronic band structure for representative Ruddlesden-Popper bilayer perovskite oxides Sr$_3$Co$_2$O$_7$, corroborated by Density Matrix Renormalization Group calculation. Due to the negative charge transfer nature of Co$^{4+}$ and imposed by strong interlayer coupling, localized molecular orbitals stemming from the hybridization of Co $d_{z^2}$ and $d_{xz/yz}$ orbitals through the apical oxygen $p$ orbitals are preferably emergent within each bilayer unit, which develop antiferromagnetic ordering by invoking Hubbard repulsion. Charge disproportionation driven by Hund's physics, makes an occupation imbalance with broken inversion symmetry in the remaining $d_{xy}$ and $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals from distinct Co atoms within the bilayer unit, resulting in the polar metallicity. Meanwhile, this charge disproportionation scenario allows consequent conducting carriers to couple with interlayer local spins via Hund's coupling, giving rise to in-plane double-exchange ferromagnetism. Our molecular orbital formulation further provides a guide towards an effective Hamiltonian for modelling the unconventional synergy of metallicity, polarity and antiferromagnetism in Sr$_3$Co$_2$O$_7$, which may be a unified framework widely applicable to double-layer Ruddlesden-Popper perovskite oxides.",

Here, the longitudinal field couples with the absolute value of the magnetic moment $|M|$ rather than the raw $M$ so that the remedied fidelity susceptibility exhibits a peak around the critical point; note that the spontaneous magnetization does not appear for the finite-size systems. As a preliminary survey, the modified fidelity susceptibility $χ^{(h)}_F$ is applied to the analysis of criticality for $J_2=0$, where a number of preceding results are available. Thereby, properly scaling the distance from the multi-criticality, $η=0.5-J_2$, the $χ^{(h)}_F$ data were cast into the crossover-scaling formula, and the multi-critical exponent for $χ_F^{(h)}$ is estimated.

      "title": "TT-FSI: Scalable Faithful Shapley Interactions via Tensor-Train",
      "abstract": "The Faithful Shapley Interaction (FSI) index uniquely satisfies the faithfulness axiom among Shapley interaction indices, but computing FSI requires $O(d^\\ell \\cdot 2^d)$ time and existing implementations use $O(4^d)$ memory. We present TT-FSI, which exploits FSI's algebraic structure via Matrix Product Operators (MPO). Our main theoretical contribution is proving that the linear operator $v \\mapsto \\text{FSI}(v)$ admits an MPO representation with TT-rank $O(\\ell d)$, enabling an efficient sweep algorithm with $O(\\ell^2 d^3 \\cdot 2^d)$ time and $O(\\ell d^2)$ core storage an exponential improvement over existing methods. Experiments on six datasets ($d=8$ to $d=20$) demonstrate up to 280$\\times$ speedup over baseline, 85$\\times$ over SHAP-IQ, and 290$\\times$ memory reduction. TT-FSI scales to $d=20$ (1M coalitions) where all competing methods fail.",

      "title": "Random-Matrix-Induced Simplicity Bias in Over-parameterized Variational Quantum Circuits",
      "abstract": "Over-parameterization is commonly used to increase the expressivity of variational quantum circuits (VQCs), yet deeper and more highly parameterized circuits often exhibit poor trainability and limited generalization. In this work, we provide a theoretical explanation for this phenomenon from a function-class perspective. We show that sufficiently expressive, unstructured variational ansatze enter a Haar-like universality class in which both observable expectation values and parameter gradients concentrate exponentially with system size. As a consequence, the hypothesis class induced by such circuits collapses with high probability to a narrow family of near-constant functions, a phenomenon we term simplicity bias, with barren plateaus arising as a consequence rather than the root cause. Using tools from random matrix theory and concentration of measure, we rigorously characterize this universality class and establish uniform hypothesis-class collapse over finite datasets. We further show that this collapse is not unavoidable: tensor-structured VQCs, including tensor-network-based and tensor-hypernetwork parameterizations, lie outside the Haar-like universality class. By restricting the accessible unitary ensemble through bounded tensor rank or bond dimension, these architectures prevent concentration of measure, preserve output variability for local observables, and retain non-degenerate gradient signals even in over-parameterized regimes. Together, our results unify barren plateaus, expressivity limits, and generalization collapse under a single structural mechanism rooted in random-matrix universality, highlighting the central role of architectural inductive bias in variational quantum algorithms.",

      "title": "Full grid solution for multi-asset options pricing with tensor networks",
      "abstract": "Pricing multi-asset options via the Black-Scholes PDE is limited by the curse of dimensionality: classical full-grid solvers scale exponentially in the number of underlyings and are effectively restricted to three assets. Practitioners typically rely on Monte Carlo methods for computing complex instrument involving multiple correlated underlyings. We show that quantized tensor trains (QTT) turn the d-asset Black-Scholes PDE into a tractable high-dimensional problem on a personal computer. We construct QTT representations of the operator, payoffs, and boundary conditions with ranks that scale polynomially in d and polylogarithmically in the grid size, and build two solvers: a time-stepping algorithm for European and American options and a space-time algorithm for European options. We compute full-grid prices and Greeks for correlated basket and max-min options in three to five dimensions with high accuracy. The methods introduced can comfortably be pushed to full-grid solutions on 10-15 underlyings, with further algorithmic optimization and more compute power.",
