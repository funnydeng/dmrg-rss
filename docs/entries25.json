      "title": "Spin Polarons in Flat Band Ferromagnets",
      "abstract": "Spin polarons are bound states of electrons and spin-flips that form above spin polarized electronic insulators.These bound states conventionally form in one of two settings: in frustrated lattices with dispersive bands -- where the motion of an electron preferences binding a nearby spin-flip -- or in topological flat bands -- where the Chern number enforces an effective dipolar interaction between electrons and spin flips. In this work, we report the formation of a spin polaron in a context that doesn't fall cleanly into either of these paradigms. In particular, we study the one-dimensional Mielke-Tasaki chain, a paradigmatic model of flat band ferromagnetism, which has an exact ferromagnetic ground state, trivial band topology, and quenched kinetic energy in its lowest band. Despite these features, our density matrix renormalization group simulations reveal the presence of spin polarons upon electron doping this model. More surprisingly, combining these numerics with analytic calculations, we show that polaron binding occurs when the interaction-induced kinetic energy of the model is zero -- contrary to intuition from kinetic magnetism -- and the glue binding the electrons and spin-flips arises from weak mixing with the model's dispersive band -- contrary to what occurs in topological flat bands. Our results open the doors to exploring how the quantum geometry of flat bands drives the formation of exotic charge carriers.",

      "abstract": "We study wavepackets that propagate across (a) topological interfaces in quantum spin systems exhibiting non-invertible symmetries and (b) duality defects coupling dual theories. We demonstrate that the transmission is always perfect, and that a particle traversing the interface is converted into a nonlocal string-like excitation. We give a systematic way of constructing such a defect by identifying its Hilbert space with the virtual bond dimension of the matrix product operator representing defect lines. Our work both gives an operational meaning to topological interfaces, and provides a lattice analogue of recent results solving the monopole paradox in quantum field theory.",

      "title": "Digitized Counterdiabatic Quantum Sampling",
      "abstract": "We propose digitized counterdiabatic quantum sampling (DCQS), a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm for efficient sampling from energy-based models, such as low-temperature Boltzmann distributions. The method utilizes counterdiabatic protocols, which suppress non-adiabatic transitions, with an iterative bias-field procedure that progressively steers the sampling toward low-energy regions. We observe that the samples obtained at each iteration correspond to approximate Boltzmann distributions at effective temperatures. By aggregating these samples and applying classical reweighting, the method reconstructs the Boltzmann distribution at a desired temperature. We define a scalable performance metric, based on the Kullback-Leibler divergence and the total variation distance, to quantify convergence toward the exact Boltzmann distribution. DCQS is validated on one-dimensional Ising models with random couplings up to 124 qubits, where exact results are available through transfer-matrix methods. We then apply it to a higher-order spin-glass Hamiltonian with 156 qubits executed on IBM quantum processors. We show that classical sampling algorithms, including Metropolis-Hastings and the state-of-the-art low-temperature technique parallel tempering, require up to three orders of magnitude more samples to match the quality of DCQS, corresponding to an approximately 2x runtime advantage. Boltzmann sampling underlies applications ranging from statistical physics to machine learning, yet classical algorithms exhibit exponentially slow convergence at low temperatures. Our results thus demonstrate a robust route toward scalable and efficient Boltzmann sampling on current quantum processors.",

      "title": "Probing Topological Phases in a Strongly Correlated Ladder Model via Entanglement",
      "abstract": "The interplay between non-trivial band topology and strong electronic correlations is a central challenge in modern condensed matter physics. We investigate this competition on a two-leg ladder model with a p-wave-like hybridisation between the legs. This model hosts a symmetry-protected topological phase in its non-interacting limit. Using the density-matrix renormalisation group algorithm, we compute the comprehensive quantum phase diagram in the presence of a repulsive inter-leg density-density interaction. Our analysis, based on entanglement entropy and the entanglement spectrum, reveals a fascinating dichotomy in the stability of the topological phase. We find a non-trivial change in the value of the edge entanglement entropy as we include interaction. Furthermore, we find that the phase boundary separating a trivial insulator phase and a topological one with winding number two remains robustly pinned at its non-interacting location, irrespective of the interaction strength. Variation of the effective conformal field theory's central charge near the critical line explains the robustness of the gap. In contrast, the transition to an insulating phase with winding number one is heavily renormalised, with the critical line shifting significantly as the interaction increases. By successfully mapping the phase diagram and identifying the distinct behaviours of the phase boundaries, our work clarifies how interactions can selectively preserve or destroy different aspects of a topological phase.",

We first employ a phenomenological field theory to qualitatively determine the phase diagram. Furthermore, we generalize a previously established alternating pattern of superconductor and tunneling regions, coupled to fractional quantum Hall edge states, to map the problem onto a topological Josephson junction chain involving lattice parafermions. Using density matrix renormalization group simulations, we establish a phase diagram composed of Mott insulating phases and two different Luttinger liquids whose fundamental excitations carry charges 2e and $2e/3$, respectively. In agreement with analytical considerations using conformal field theory, we numerically find transitions of Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) type as well as a continuous $\\mathbb Z_3 \\times U(1)$ second-order phase transition characterized by central charge c = 9/5. We finally extract information about a possible ground state degeneracy and comment on the stability of parafermionic edge states in the presence of fluctuations. These theoretical foundations can be expected to be of practical importance for gate-defined FCI-SC heterostructures in moiré materials, in which broad superconducting transitions indicative of strong order parameter fluctuations were observed.",

      "title": "Fractional Chern insulators on cylinders: Tao-Thouless states and beyond",
      "abstract": "Topological phases in two-dimensional quantum lattice models are often studied on cylinders for revealing different topological properties and making the problem numerically tractable. This makes a proper understanding of finite-circumference effects crucial for reliably extrapolating the results to the thermodynamic limit. Using matrix product states, we investigate these effects for the Laughlin-1/2 phase in the Hofstadter-Bose-Hubbard model, which can be viewed as the lattice discretization of the bosonic quantum Hall problem in the continuum. We propose a scaling of the model's parameters with the cylinder circumference that simultaneously approaches the continuum and thermodynamic limits. We find that different scaling schemes yield distinct topological signatures: we either retrieve a spontaneous formation of charge density wave ordering reminiscent of the Tao-Thouless states, known from the continuum problem on thin cylinders, or we find uniform states with a topological degeneracy that can be identified as minimally entangled states known from studies of chiral spin liquids on cylinders. Finally, we carry out a similar analysis of the non-Abelian Moore-Read phase in the same model. Our results clarify the role of symmetries in numerical studies of topologically ordered states on cylinders and highlight the role of lattice effects.",

      "abstract": "This paper investigates the structure of linear operators introduced in Hernandez et al. [2023] that decode specific relational facts in transformer language models. We extend their single-relation findings to a collection of relations and systematically chart their organization. We show that such collections of relation decoders can be highly compressed by simple order-3 tensor networks without significant loss in decoding accuracy. To explain this surprising redundancy, we develop a cross-evaluation protocol, in which we apply each linear decoder operator to the subjects of every other relation. Our results reveal that these linear maps do not encode distinct relations, but extract recurring, coarse-grained semantic properties (e.g., country of capital city and country of food are both in the country-of-X property). This property-centric structure clarifies both the operators' compressibility and highlights why they generalize only to new relations that are semantically close. Our findings thus interpret linear relational decoding in transformer language models as primarily property-based, rather than relation-specific.",

      "title": "Fermionic dynamics on a trapped-ion quantum computer beyond exact classical simulation",
      "abstract": "Simulation of the time-dynamics of fermionic many-body systems has long been predicted to be one of the key applications of quantum computers. Such simulations -- for which classical methods are often inaccurate -- are critical to advancing our knowledge and understanding of quantum chemistry and materials, underpinning a wide range of fields, from biochemistry to clean-energy technologies and chemical synthesis. However, the performance of all previous digital quantum simulations has been matched by classical methods, and it has thus far remained unclear whether near-term, intermediate-scale quantum hardware could offer any computational advantage in this area. Here, we implement an efficient quantum simulation algorithm on Quantinuum's System Model H2 trapped-ion quantum computer for the time dynamics of a 56-qubit system that is too complex for exact classical simulation. We focus on the periodic spinful 2D Fermi-Hubbard model and present evidence of spin-charge separation, where the elementary electron's charge and spin decouple. In the limited cases where ground truth is available through exact classical simulation, we find that it agrees with the results we obtain from the quantum device. Employing long-range Wilson operators to study deconfinement of the effective gauge field between spinons and the effective potential between charge carriers, we find behaviour that differs from predictions made by classical tensor network methods. Our results herald the use of quantum computing for simulating strongly correlated electronic systems beyond the capacity of classical computing.",

      "abstract": "We investigate the phases and phase-transitions in one-dimensional alternating mixed-spin (1/2-1) chain in the presence of both frustration and anisotropy. Frustration is introduced via next-nearest-neighbor interactions, while single-ion anisotropy is incorporated at each lattice site. Our results show that moderate frustration can drive a phase transition from a ferrimagnetic state to an anti-ferromagnetic ground state. Remarkably, the presence of a weak easy-plane anisotropy destabilizes the ferrimagnetic order, also leading to the emergence of an antiferromagnetic phase. Interestingly, under strong frustration and anisotropy, the system exhibits signatures of a novel phase with spin density wave (SDW)-like modulation . We explore these anomalous phase transitions by employing exact diagonalization (ED) for small system sizes and the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) method to characterize ground state properties for larger system sizes. We also investigate the finite-temperature behavior across various phases using the ancilla-based time-evolving block decimation (TEBD) approach. The primary objective of this work is to elucidate the phase structure of alternating mixed-spin chains under the combined effects of frustration and anisotropy. The primary objective of this work is to elucidate the intricate interplay between frustration and anisotropy in identifying the exotic phases and phase-transitions in alternating mixed-spin chains. Our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of mixed-spin quantum systems and may offer insights for future theoretical and experimental studies.",

      "title": "Heuristic Quantum Advantage with Peaked Circuits",
      "abstract": "We design and demonstrate heuristic quantum advantage with peaked circuits (HQAP circuits) on Quantinuum's System Model H2 quantum processor. Through extensive experimentation with state-of-the-art classical simulation strategies, we identify a clear gap between classical and quantum runtimes. Our largest instance involves all-to-all connectivity with 2000 two-qubit gates, which H2 can produce the target peaked bitstring directly in under 2 hours. Our extrapolations from leading classical simulation techniques such as tensor networks with belief propagation and Pauli path simulators indicate the same instance would take years on exascale systems (Frontier, Summit), suggesting a potentially exponential separation. This work marks an important milestone toward verifiable quantum advantage, as well as providing a useful benchmarking protocol for current utility-scale quantum hardware. We sketch our protocol for designing these circuits and provide extensive numerical results leading to our extrapolation estimates. Separate from our constructed HQAP circuits, we prove hardness on a decision problem involving generic peaked circuits. When both the input and output bitstrings of a peaked circuit are unknown, determining whether the circuit is peaked constitutes a QCMA-complete problem, meaning the problem remains hard even for a quantum polynomial-time machine under commonly accepted complexity assumptions. Inspired by this observation, we propose an application of the peaked circuits as a potentially quantum-safe encryption scheme~\\cite{chen2016report,kumar2020post,joseph2022transitioning,dam2023survey}. We make our peaked circuits publicly available and invite the community to try additional methods to solve these circuits to see if this gap persists even with novel classical techniques.",

In this work, we generalize this notion by considering simple quantum states and examining the local Hamiltonians that have these states as exact eigenstates.These states often correspond to Quantum Many-Body Scars (QMBS) of their respective parent Hamiltonians.Motivated by earlier works on Hamiltonians with QMBS, in this work we formalize the differences between three distinct types of parent Hamiltonians, which differ in their decompositions into strictly local terms with the same eigenstates. We illustrate this classification using the $W$ state as the primary example, for which we rigorously derive the complete set of local parent Hamiltonians, which also allows us to establish general results such as the existence of asymptotic QMBS, and distinct dynamical signatures associated with the different parent Hamiltonian types. Finally, we derive more general results on the parent Hamiltonian types that allow us to obtain some immediate results for simple quantum states such as product states, where only a single type exists, and for short-range-entangled states, for which we identify constraints on the admissible types. Altogether, our work opens the door to classifying the rich structures and dynamical properties of parent Hamiltonians that arise from the interplay between locality and QMBS.",

In this work, we demonstrate the preparation of matrix product states (MPS) using a renormalization-group(RG)-based quantum algorithm on superconducting quantum hardware. Compared to sequential generation, it has been shown that the RG-based protocol asymptotically prepares short-range correlated MPS with an exponentially shallower circuit depth (when scaling system size), but it is not yet clear for which system sizes it starts to convey an advantage. We thus apply this algorithm to prepare a class of MPS exhibiting a phase transition between a symmetry-protected topological (SPT) and a trivial phase for systems of up to 80 qubits. We find that the reduced depth of the RG-based circuits makes them more resilient to noise, and that they generally outperform the sequential circuits for large systems, as we showcase by measuring string-order-like local expectation values and energy densities. We thus demonstrate that the RG-based protocol enables large-scale preparation of MPS and, in particular, SPT-ordered states beyond the fixed point.",

By applying the Density Matrix Renormalization Group, we diagonalize the spin-valley-polarized Hamiltonian and show signatures of coexisting singlet and triplet pairings in the range of hole dopings and displacement fields reported in the experiments. In this view, we show that the superconductivity in the WSe$_{2}$/WSe$_{2}$ twisted homobilayer is likely to be induced by electronic correlations and has a mixed-symmetry character. These predictions can shed light on the nature of the superconducting state observed in the twisted homobilayer of WSe$_{2}$/WSe$_{2}$.

      "abstract": "Sampling problems have emerged as a central avenue for demonstrating quantum advantage on noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices. However, physical noise can fundamentally alter their computational complexity, often making them classically tractable. Motivated by the recent success of matrix product state (MPS)-based classical simulation of Gaussian boson sampling (Oh et al., 2024), we extend this framework to investigate the classical simulability of other noisy quantum sampling models. We develop MPS-based classical algorithms for lossy boson sampling and noisy instantaneous quantum polynomial-time (IQP) sampling, both of which retain the tunable accuracy characteristic of the MPS approach through the bond dimension. Our approach constructs pure-state decompositions of noisy or lossy input states whose components remain weakly entangled after circuit evolution, thereby providing a means to systematically explore the boundary between quantum-hard and classically-simulable regimes. For boson sampling, we analyze single-photon, Fock, and cat-state inputs, showing that classical simulability emerges at transmission rates scaling as $O(1/\\sqrt{N})$, reaching the known boundary of quantum advantage with a tunable and scalable method. Beyond reproducing previous thresholds, our algorithm offers significantly improved control over the accuracy-efficiency trade-off. It further extends the applicability of MPS-based simulation to broader classes of noisy quantum sampling models, including IQP circuits.",

      "abstract": "We investigate the quantum statistical properties of the confining string connecting a static fermion-antifermion pair in the massive Schwinger model. By analyzing the reduced density matrix of the subsystem located in between the fermion and antifermion, we demonstrate that as the interfermion separation approaches the string-breaking distance, the overlap between the microscopic density matrix and an effective thermal density matrix exhibits a pronounced, narrow peak, approaching unity at the onset of string breaking. This behavior reveals that the confining flux tube evolves toward a genuinely thermal state as the separation between the charges grows, even in the absence of an external heat bath. In other words, one cannot tell whether a reduced state of the subsystem arises from a surrounding heat bath or from entanglement with the rest of the system. The entanglement spectrum near the critical string-breaking distance exhibits a rapid transition from the dominance of a single state describing the confining electric string towards a strongly entangled state containing virtual fermion-antifermion pairs. Our findings establish a quantitative link between confinement, entanglement, and emergent thermality, and suggest that string breaking corresponds to a microscopic thermalization transition within the flux tube.",

We also define a quantity $(\\mathfrak{c}_{\\text{tot}})_{\\text{min}}$ that reflects the robustness of corner entanglement contributions, and show that it provides an obstruction to a gapped boundary. One reward from our analysis is that we can construct a local gapped Hamiltonian within the same chiral gapped phase from a given wavefunction; we conjecture that it is closer to the low-energy renormalization group fixed point than the original parent Hamiltonian. Our analysis of corner entanglement reveals the emergence of a universal conformal geometry encoded in the entanglement structure of bulk regions of chiral gapped states that is not visible in topological field theory.",

Here, we show that resonant pair-production terms give rise to an additional repulsive binding mechanism that forms a stable ``hadron'' bound state of two mesons. A high-energy state, the hadron is stabilized by being off-resonantly coupled to a continuum. We study the dynamical formation of this bound state starting from local excitations. We use matrix product state techniques based on the time-evolving block decimation algorithm to perform our numerical simulations and analyze the effect of model parameters on hadron formation. Furthermore, we derive an effective model that explains its formation. Our findings are amenable to experimental observation on modern quantum hardware from superconducting qubits to trapped ions.",

      "abstract": "The use of magnetic nanographenes as building blocks for artificial spin lattices is enabling the exploration of flagship model Hamiltonians of one-dimensional quantum magnetism with an unprecedented degree of control. The spin-1 Heisenberg model, incorporating both linear and quadratic exchange interactions, was first realized using [3]-triangulenes, where the hallmark Haldane phase with spin fractionalization was observed. Later, the spin-1/2 Heisenberg Hamiltonian with exchange alternation was realized with Clar's goblets, where two additional topological phases were identified. Here we show that spin-1 nanographenes can also be used to explore the topological phase transition between the Haldane phase and a dimerized phase predicted for spin-1 chains with bond-alternation. We first study how the boundary of the phase transition is modified by non-linear exchange, known to be present in spin-1 nanographenes, using density matrix renormalization group (DMRG). Combining multiconfigurational with first-principles calculations, we propose two candidates to realize different topological phases of the model: a recently synthesized extended Clar's goblet, and a passivated [4]-triangulene. Moreover, we show how these two phases can be identified experimentally using inelastic electron tunneling spectroscopy (IETS).

We conduct extensive benchmarking on key observables, including energy density, susceptibility, specific heat, and two-point correlations, comparing against exact analytical results for 1D systems and quantum Monte Carlo simulations for 2D lattices across various temperatures and ansatz configurations. Our large-scale numerical simulations demonstrate the capability to prepare high-quality Gibbs states for 1D lattice models with up to 30 sites and 2D systems with up to 6x6 sites, using up to 42 qubits. Finally, we demonstrate the framework's practical viability on a 156-qubit IBM Heron processor by preparing the approximate Gibbs state of a 30-site transverse-field Ising model.

Deviations from the classical description due to the quantum nature of the atomic spins as well as quantum fluctuations are usually treated as negligible if long-range order is preserved, and are rarely quantified for actual materials. Here, we demonstrate that a fully quantum-mechanical framework is required for a quantitatively correct description of the spin-flop transition in the insulating altermagnet hematite between the collinear antiferromagnetic and the weakly ferromagnetic spin-flop phase at low temperature. By applying both exact diagonalization and density-matrix renormalization group theory to the quantum Heisenberg Hamiltonian, we show how a quantum-mechanical treatment of an ab initio parametrized spin model can significantly improve the predicted low-temperature spin-flop field over a classical description when compared to measurements. Our results imply that quantum fluctuations have a measurable influence on selecting the ground state of a system out of competing ordered magnetic phases at low temperature.",

From our calculations, there are five phases in the parameters regime $0<\\lambda_1=J_2/J_1<4, 0<\\lambda_2=J_3/J_1<4$, including a Néel antiferromagentic phase, a Haldane-like symmetry protected topological phase, a hexagon phase and two dimer phases. In the Haldane-like SPT phase, we characterized its topological nature using the degeneracy of ground-state energy under open boundary condition and the entanglement spectrum. To characterize the phase boundaries, we use spin stiffness and Binder cumulant to do the comprehensive finite-size scalings. From data collapse, the critical behaviors of all the nonmagnetic phases to the antiferromagnetic phase belong to the 3D $O(3)$ Heisenberg universality class.

Valuable insight comes from examining how few-body correlations manifest in many-body systems, embodying the ``from few to many'' philosophy. An intriguing example is the set of universal relations in ultracold atomic gases, which connect a wide range of observables to a single quantity known as the contact. In this Letter, we demonstrate that universal relations manifest in a distinct class of quantum many-body systems, long-range quantum spin chains, which belong to a completely new universality class. Using effective field theory and the operator product expansion, we establish connections between the asymptotic behavior of equal-time spin correlation functions, the dynamical structure factor, and the contact density. The theoretical predictions for equal-time correlators are explicitly verified through numerical simulations based on matrix product states. Our results could be readily tested in state-of-the-art trapped-ion systems.",

Nevertheless, the recovery of local details in the reconstructed tensor still leaves scope for enhancement. In this paper, we propose efficient tensor completion model that incorporates trace regularization within the FCTN decomposition framework. The trace regularization is constructed based on the mode-$k$ unfolding of the FCTN factors combined with periodically modified negative laplacian. The trace regularization promotes the smoothness of the FCTN factors through discrete second-order derivative penalties, thereby enhancing the continuity and local recovery performance of the reconstructed tensor. To solve the proposed model, we develop an efficient algorithm within the proximal alternating minimization (PAM) framework and theoretically prove its convergence. To reduce the runtime of the proposed algorithm, we design an intermediate tensor reuse mechanism that can decrease runtime by 10\\%-30\\% without affecting image recovery, with more significant improvements for larger-scale data. A comprehensive complexity analysis reveals that the mechanism attains a reduced computational complexity.

TN-SHAP replaces exhaustive coalition sweeps with just a small number of targeted evaluations to extract order-k Shapley interactions. In particular, both order-1 (single-feature) and order-2 (pairwise) computations have cost O(n*poly(chi) + n^2), where chi is the TN's maximal cut rank. We provide theoretical guarantees on the approximation error and tractability of TN-SHAP.

Using tools from geometric group theory, we identify three qualitatively distinct scalings of temporal entanglement entropy, establishing a hierarchy of computational resources required for accurate tensor-network representations of the IM for these models. We further analyze the memory structure of the IM and distinguish between classical and quantum temporal correlations. In particular, for certain examples, we identify effectively classical IMs that admit an efficient Monte Carlo algorithm for computing multitime correlations. In more generic settings without an explicit classical description of the IM, we introduce an operational measure of quantum memory with an experimental protocol, and discuss examples exhibiting long-time genuinely quantum correlations.

Standard approaches involving time-stepping schemes compute the solution at each time step, which becomes too costly when simulating long-term dynamics. Alternatively, space-time methods that treat the combined space-time domain simultaneously promise better stability and accuracy. Interestingly, data-driven approaches for learning and predicting dynamics, such as dynamic mode decomposition (DMD), also employ a combined space-time representation. However, the curse of dimensionality often limits the practical benefits of space-time methods. In this work, we investigate quantum-inspired methods for space-time approaches, both for solving PDEs and for making DMD predictions. We achieve this goal by treating both spatial and temporal dimensions within a single matrix product state (MPS) encoding. First, we benchmark our MPS space-time solver for both linear and nonlinear PDEs, observing that the MPS ansatz accurately captures the underlying spatio-temporal correlations while having significantly fewer degrees of freedom. Second, we develop an MPS-DMD algorithm to make accurate long-term predictions of nonlinear systems, with runtime scaling logarithmically in both spatial and temporal resolution.

      "abstract": "Although Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) can be computed in polynomial time for simple models like decision trees, they unfortunately become NP-hard to compute for more expressive black-box models like neural networks - where generating explanations is often most critical. In this work, we analyze the problem of computing SHAP explanations for *Tensor Networks (TNs)*, a broader and more expressive class of models than those for which current exact SHAP algorithms are known to hold, and which is widely used for neural network abstraction and compression. First, we introduce a general framework for computing provably exact SHAP explanations for general TNs with arbitrary structures. Interestingly, we show that, when TNs are restricted to a *Tensor Train (TT)* structure, SHAP computation can be performed in *poly-logarithmic* time using *parallel* computation. Thanks to the expressiveness power of TTs, this complexity result can be generalized to many other popular ML models such as decision trees, tree ensembles, linear models, and linear RNNs, therefore tightening previously reported complexity results for these families of models. Finally, by leveraging reductions of binarized neural networks to Tensor Network representations, we demonstrate that SHAP computation can become *efficiently tractable* when the network's *width* is fixed, while it remains computationally hard even with constant *depth*. This highlights an important insight: for this class of models, width - rather than depth - emerges as the primary computational bottleneck in SHAP computation.",

      "title": "Tensor Renormalization-Group study of the surface critical behavior of a frustrated two-layer Ising model",
      "abstract": "Two replicas of a 2D Ising model are coupled by frustrated spin-spin interactions. It is known that this inter-layer coupling is marginal and that the bulk critical behavior belongs to the Ashkin-Teller (AT) universality class, as the $J_1$-$J_2$ Ising model. In this work, the surface critical behavior is studied numerically by Tensor Renormalization-Group calculations. The Bond-Weight Tensor Renormalization Group algorithm is extended to tackle systems with boundaries. It is observed that the two-fold degeneracy of the surface magnetic scaling dimension of the AT model is lifted in the frustrated two-layer Ising model (F2LIM). The splitting is explained by the breaking of the ${\\mathbb Z}_2$-symmetry under spin reversal of a single Ising replica in the F2LIM. The two distinct surface magnetic scaling dimensions $x_1^s$ and $x_2^s$ of the F2LIM satisfies a simple duality relation $x_1^s=1/4x_2^s$.",

      "abstract": "We study the entanglement dynamics of a one-dimensional spin chain subject to a local Floquet drive of a two-site impurity. We uncover a sharp transition in the entanglement dynamics as a function of the driving frequency. For large drive periods $T$, we observe a linear growth in entanglement entropy (EE), indicating a heating phase with volume law entanglement. Surprisingly, for driving periods below a critical value $T_\\ast$, the EE grows subextensively with time, characteristic of a local quantum quench. In the non-interacting limit, we analytically trace the origin of this phenomenon to a transition in the single-particle Floquet quasi-energy spectrum. We also find that for $T>T_*$, the so-called ``average energy\" operator develops non-local, rainbow-like couplings that are responsible for the rapid entanglement growth in the heating phase, but remains local for $T<T_*$. Using extensive matrix-product-state simulations, we show that the non-heating phase and the subextensive entanglement growth persist in the presence of weak interactions for numerically accessible timescales. Our results establish that local Floquet engineering can generate emergent bulk phenomena, shedding new light on energy localization and thermalization in driven many-body systems.",

The proposed block-isoPEPS ansatz offers several attractive features for PEPS-based algorithms, including exact block orthogonalization, controlled local truncation via singular value decompositions, and efficient evaluation of observables. We demonstrate the proposed inexact subspace iteration for block-isoPEPS by computing excitations of the two-dimensional transverse-field Ising and Heisenberg models and compare our results with existing PEPS methods.

Our primary tool is the finite system density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) method with both interaction-strength scan and fixed interaction techniques for cylinders of circumference 3, 5, and 7 and lengths up to 240. For the IQH phase, we use single particle exact diagonalization to clarify finite size effects, including an excess charge on the edges of our cylinders, and the limitations of entanglement spectra degeneracies on small circumference cylinders. For both phases, we use DMRG to study the entanglement spectra, the entanglement entropy, and the effect of flux insertion on charge and spin pumping, all of which show key differences between the two phases. To study the transition, we use interaction-strength scans extending between the two phases, and apply a scaling data collapse of a bond-dimerization order parameter to extract critical exponents. We also extract critical behavior from the divergence of correlation lengths on the IQH side, measuring decay away from edges of both the dimerization order parameter and transverse edge currents. The critical behavior and exponents are consistent with an Ising transition in 1+1 dimensions. Finally, we obtain excited states in various quantum number sectors finding that the gap to a charge neutral momentum $\\pi$ excitation corresponding to fluctuations of the dimerization order parameter closes in the vicinity of the critical point but gaps to other excitations remain large.",

      "abstract": "We propose and evaluate a quantum-inspired algorithm for solving Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problems, which are mathematically equivalent to finding ground states of Ising spin-glass Hamiltonians. The algorithm employs Matrix Product States (MPS) to compactly represent large superpositions of spin configurations and utilizes a discrete driving schedule to guide the MPS toward the ground state. At each step, a driver Hamiltonian -- incorporating a transverse magnetic field -- is combined with the problem Hamiltonian to enable spin flips and facilitate quantum tunneling. The MPS is updated using the standard Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) method, which iteratively minimizes the system's energy via multiple sweeps across the spin chain. Despite its heuristic nature, the algorithm reliably identifies global minima, not merely near-optimal solutions, across diverse QUBO instances. We first demonstrate its effectiveness on intermediate-level Sudoku puzzles from publicly available sources, involving over $200$ Ising spins with long-range couplings dictated by constraint satisfaction. We then apply the algorithm to MaxCut problems from the Biq Mac library, successfully solving instances with up to $251$ nodes and $3,265$ edges. We discuss the advantages of this quantum-inspired approach, including its scalability, generalizability, and suitability for industrial-scale QUBO applications.",

Exploiting symmetries of a system in a TNRG algorithm can simplify the implementation of the algorithm and can help produce correct tensor RG flows. Although a general framework for considering a global on-site symmetry has been established, it is still unclear how to incorporate a lattice symmetry like rotation or reflection in TNRG. As a first step for lattice symmetries, we propose a method to incorporate the lattice-reflection symmetry in the context of a TNRG with entanglement filtering in both two and three dimensions (2D and 3D). To achieve this, we write down a general definition of lattice-reflection symmetry in tensor-network language. Then, we introduce a transposition trick for exploiting and imposing the lattice-reflection symmetry in two basic TNRG operators: projective truncations and entanglement filtering. Using the transposition trick, the detailed algorithms of the TNRG map in both 2D and 3D are laid out, where the lattice-reflection symmetry is preserved and imposed. Finally, we demonstrate how to construct the linearization of the TNRG maps in a given lattice-reflection sector, with the help of which it becomes possible to extract scaling dimensions in each sector separately.

      "abstract": "We propose a hybrid quantum-classical eigensolver to address the computational challenges of simulating strongly correlated quantum many-body systems, where the exponential growth of the Hilbert space and extensive entanglement render classical methods intractable. Our approach combines real-space sampling of tensor-network-bridged quantum circuits with symmetric subspace measurements, effectively constraining the wavefunction within a substaintially reduced Hilbert space for efficient and scalable simulations of versatile target states. The system is partitioned into equal-sized subsystems, where quantum circuits capture local entanglement and tensor networks reconnect them to recover global correlations, thereby overcoming partition-induced limitations. Symmetric subspace measurements exploit point-group symmetries through a many-to-one mapping that aggregates equivalent real-space configurations into a single symmetric state, effectively enhancing real-space bipartition entanglement while elimilating redundant degrees of freedom. The tensor network further extends this connectivity across circuits, restoring global entanglement and correlation, while simultaneously enabling generative sampling for efficient optimization. As a proof of concept, we apply the method to the periodic $J_1\\!-\\!J_2$ antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model in one and two dimensions, incorporating translation, reflection, and inversion symmetries. With a small matrix product state bond dimension of up to 6, the method achieves an absolute energy error of $10^{-5}$ for a 64-site periodic chain and a $6\\times6$ torus after bond-dimension extrapolation. These results validate the accuracy and efficiency of the hybrid eigensolver and demonstrate its strong potential for scalable quantum simulations of strongly correlated systems.",

Specifically, we calculate Wigner negativity -- a magic monotone which can be interpreted as a measure of the stabilizer complexity, or equivalently, the complexity of classical simulation -- in various toy models for evaporating black holes. We first calculate the Wigner negativity of Hawking radiation in the PSSY model directly using the gravitational path integral, and show that the negativity is $O(1)$ before the Page transition, but becomes exponentially large past the Page transition. We also derive a universal, information theoretic formula for the negativity which interpolates between the two extremes. We then study the Wigner negativity of radiation in a dynamical model of black hole evaporation. In this case, the negativity shows a sharp spike at early times resulting from the coupling between the black hole and the radiation system, but at late times when the system settles down, we find that the negativity satisfies the same universal formula as in the PSSY model. Finally, we also propose a geometric formula for Wigner negativity in general holographic states using intuition from fixed area states and random tensor networks, and argue that a python's lunch in the entanglement wedge implies a stabilizer complexity which is exponentially large in $\\frac{1}{8G_N}$ times the difference between the areas corresponding to the outermost and minimal extremal surfaces.",

Beyond the Haerter-Shastry regime, we find an intermediate phase with multimer (involving multiple correlated spins) stripes that eventually gives way to a paramagnet. We also find evidence of gapless charge excitations (metallicity) throughout the phase diagram for finite hole density.

Additionally, we demonstrate that the frustrated spin-1 diamond chain can operate as an efficient working medium of a quantum Stirling engine, which approaches near-optimal efficiency when driven into these unconventional quantum states.",

      "abstract": "Tensor decomposition is a powerful tool for data analysis and has been extensively employed in the field of hyperspectral-multispectral image fusion (HMF). Existing tensor decomposition-based fusion methods typically rely on disruptive data vectorization/reshaping or impose rigid constraints on the arrangement of factor tensors, hindering the preservation of spatial-spectral structures and the modeling of cross-dimensional correlations. Although recent advances utilizing the Fully-Connected Tensor Network (FCTN) decomposition have partially alleviated these limitations, the process of reorganizing data into higher-order tensors still disrupts the intrinsic spatial-spectral structure. Furthermore, these methods necessitate extensive manual parameter tuning and exhibit limited robustness against noise and spatial degradation. To alleviate these issues, we propose the Bayesian FCTN (BFCTN) method. Within this probabilistic framework, a hierarchical sparse prior that characterizing the sparsity of physical elements, establishes connections between the factor tensors. This framework explicitly models the intrinsic physical coupling among spatial structures, spectral signatures, and local scene homogeneity. For model learning, we develop a parameter estimation method based on Variational Bayesian inference (VB) and the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm, which significantly reduces the need for manual parameter tuning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BFCTN not only achieves state-of-the-art fusion accuracy and strong robustness but also exhibits practical applicability in complex real-world scenarios.",

Within this framework, we scrutinize the impact of topology on the entanglement structure for low-dimensional manifolds, including especially the torus, the Klein bottle, and lens spaces. By further incorporating gauge invariance, we refine our framework to determine the entanglement structure for topological gauge theories in arbitrary dimensions.

The reshaping of the input matrix into a tensor allows for representation of the butterfly decomposition as a tensor decomposition with dense tensors. This leads to efficient utilization of the existing software infrastructure for dense and sparse tensor computations. We propose two tensor completion algorithms in the butterfly format, using alternating least squares and gradient-based optimization, as well as a novel strategy that uses low-rank matrix completion to efficiently generate an initial guess for the proposed algorithms. To demonstrate the efficiency and applicability of our proposed algorithms, we perform three numerical experiments using simulated oscillatory operators in seismic applications. In these experiments, we use $\\mathcal {O} (n \\log n)$ observed entries in the input matrix and demonstrate an $\\mathcal{O}(n\\log^3 n)$ computational cost of the proposed algorithms, leading to a speedup of orders of magnitudes per iteration for large matrices compared to the low-rank matrix and quantized tensor-train completion. Moreover, the proposed butterfly completion algorithms, equipped with the novel initial guess generation strategy, achieve reconstruction errors that are smaller by an order of magnitude, enabling accurate recovery of the underlying structure compared to the state-of-the-art completion algorithms.",

Finite-size scaling reveals that these effects become more pronounced with larger systems, highlighting non-stabilizerness as a sensitive marker for both quantum criticality and non-Hermitian spectral degeneracies. We also investigate magic in momentum space for the XX model analytically and find that is reaches a minimum around exceptional points.

Operator theory views such dynamics as linear maps on Hilbert spaces containing mean embedding vectors of distributions, offering an appealing but currently overlooked perspective. We propose a new approach to sequence modeling based on an operator-theoretic view of a hidden Markov model (HMM). Instead of materializing stochastic recurrence, we embed the full sequence distribution as a tensor in the product Hilbert space. A generative process is then defined as maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) gradient flow in the space of sequences. To overcome challenges with large tensors and slow sampling convergence, we introduce spectral mean flows, a novel tractable algorithm integrating two core concepts. First, we propose a new neural architecture by leveraging spectral decomposition of linear operators to derive a scalable tensor network decomposition of sequence mean embeddings. Second, we extend MMD gradient flows to time-dependent Hilbert spaces and connect them to flow matching via the continuity equation, enabling simulation-free learning and faster sampling. We demonstrate competitive results on a range of time-series modeling datasets. Code is available at https://github.com/jw9730/spectral-mean-flow.",

The algorithm directly works with quantum states: given the ground-state configurations for different values of the Hamiltonian parameters, the process uncovers the most significant way of grouping them based on a similarity criterion that refers to the fidelity between quantum states, that can be easily estimated, even experimentally. We benchmark our method with two specific spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ chains, with states determined via tensor network techniques.

Here, we numerically demonstrate bosonic FCIs in two types of non-Chern flat bands in honeycomb lattices, using exact diagonalization and density matrix renormalization group calculations. In a gapless flat band with a singular band touching, we observe a Laughlin state at half filling, stabilized by onsite interactions from the hard-core limit down to arbitrarily small strength. Furthermore, we report the first example of a non- Abelian FCI in a non-Chern band system: a Moore-Read state at $\\nu$ = 1 filling of the same singular flat band with hard-core bosons. Under lattice parameters that realize a gapped trivial band (C = 0) of exact flatness, we also find the Laughlin FCI of soft-core bosons in the isolated band limit where onsite interaction is much smaller than the band gap. In this case, the FCI forms as interacting bosons spontaneously avoid the peaks in quantum metric and Berry curvature, preferentially occupying Brillouin zone region with relatively uniform quantum geometry.

We show that these transitions are entanglement-driven, i.e., they require initially entangled states and remain invisible to conventional local observables. Intriguingly, we find these transitions across a broad range of driving frequencies (from adiabatic to high-frequency regime) and independently of drive details, where they manifest as periodic, sharp entanglement spectrum reorganizations marked by the Schmidt-gap closure, a vanishing entanglement echo, and symmetry-quantum-number flips. At high frequencies, the entanglement Hamiltonian acquires an intrinsic timescale decoupled from the drive period, rendering the transitions genuine steady-state features. Finite-size scaling reveals universal critical behavior with correlation-length exponent $\\nu=1$, matching equilibrium Ising universality despite its emergence from purely dynamical mechanisms decoupled from static criticality.

Before reaching equilibrium, however, they can transiently exhibit long-lived prethermal states that host exotic nonequilibrium phenomena, such as discrete time crystals (DTCs). In this study, we investigate the relaxation dynamics of periodically driven product states in a kicked Ising model implemented on the IBM Quantum Eagle and Heron processors. By using ancilla qubits to mediate interactions, we construct Kagome and Lieb lattices on superconducting qubits with heavy-hex connectivity. We identify two distinct types of noise-induced DTCs on Kagome and Lieb lattices, both arising from quantum noise in ancilla qubits. Type-I DTCs originate from robust boundary-mode period-doubling oscillations, stabilized by symmetry charge pumping, that are redistributed into the bulk due to ancilla noise. Type-II DTCs, in contrast, emerge in systems without charge-pumped qubits, where quantum noise unexpectedly stabilizes period-doubling oscillations that would otherwise rapidly decay. On the noisier Eagle device (ibm_kyiv), we observe both type-I and type-II DTCs on 53-qubit Kagome lattices with and without charge-pumped qubits, respectively. In contrast, on the lower-noise Heron device (ibm_marrakesh), period-doubling oscillations are confined to boundary-localized oscillations on 82-qubit Kagome and 40-qubit Lieb lattices, as redistribution into the bulk is suppressed. These experimental findings are supported by noisy matrix-product-state simulations, in which ancilla noise is modeled as random sign flips in the two-qubit gate rotation angles. Our results demonstrate that quantum noise in ancilla qubits can give rise to novel classes of prethermal dynamical phases, including boundary-protected and noise-induced DTCs.",

An essential ingredient of our approach is to represent the PDE solutions by the functional tensor train format whose TT-core functions are approximated by neural networks.

      "abstract": "Inspired by the Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki (AKLT) model, we present exact solutions for a spin-1 chain with Kitaev-like couplings. We consider an expanded Kitaev model with bilinear and biquadratic terms. At an exactly solvable point, the Hamiltonian can be reexpressed as a sum of projection operators. Unlike the AKLT model where projectors act on total spin, we project onto components of spin along the bond direction. This leads to exponential ground state degeneracy, expressed in terms of fractionalized spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ objects. Each ground state can be expressed concisely as a matrix product state. We construct a phase diagram by varying the relative strength of bilinear and biquadratic terms. The fractionalized states provide a qualitative picture for the spin-1 Kitaev model, yielding approximate forms for the ground state and low-lying excitations.",

Focusing on the operator entanglement $S_{\\rm op}$ of the sampling-induced boundary state, first, we reproduce in the noiseless limit a finite-depth transition from area- to volume-law scaling. With on-site probablistic trace noise at any constant rate $p>0$, the maximal $S_{\\rm op}$ attained along the sampling trajectory obeys an area law in the boundary length and scales approximately linearly with $T/p$. By analyzing the spatial distribution of stabilizer generators, we observe exponential localization of stabilizer generators; this both accounts for the scaling of the maximal $S_{\\rm op}$ and implies an exponential decay of conditional mutual information across buffered tripartitions, which we also confirm numerically. Together, these results indicate that constant local noise destroys long-range, volume-law measurement-induced entanglement in 2D random Clifford circuits. Finally, based on the observed scaling, we conjecture that a tensor-network-based algorithm can efficiently sample from noisy 2D random Clifford circuits (i) at sub-logarithmic depths $T = o(\\log N)$ for any constant noise rate $p = \\Omega(1)$, and (ii) at constant depths $T = O(1)$ for noise rates $p = \\Omega(\\log^{-1}N)$.",

Matrix product states, for instance, are efficient but limited to area law entangled states. Neural quantum states (NQS) are widely believed to overcome such limitations, yet little is known about their fundamental constraints. Here we prove that feed-forward neural quantum states acting on $n$ spins with $k$ scalar nonlinearities, under certain analyticity assumptions, obey a bound on entanglement entropy for any subregion: $S \\leq c k\\log n$, for a constant $c$. This establishes an NQS analog of the area law constraint for matrix product states and rules out volume law entanglement for NQS with $O(1)$ nonlinearities. We demonstrate analytically and numerically that the scaling with $n$ is tight for a wide variety of NQS. Our work establishes a fundamental constraint on NQS that applies broadly across different network designs, while reinforcing their substantial expressive power.",

However, accurately solving its long-time dynamics still remains a great numerical challenge. An emergent and rapidly developing numerical strategy to solve the AIM is to represent the Feynman-Vernon influence functional (IF), which encodes all the bath effects on the impurity dynamics, as a matrix product state (MPS) in the temporal domain. The computational cost of this strategy is basically determined by the bond dimension $\\chi$ of the temporal MPS. In this work, we propose an efficient and accurate method which, when the hybridization function in the IF can be approximated as the summation of $n$ exponential functions, can systematically build the IF as a MPS by multiplying $O(n)$ small MPSs, each with bond dimension $2$. Our method gives a worst case scaling of $\\chi$ as $2^{8n}$ and $2^{2n}$ for real- and imaginary-time evolution respectively. We demonstrate the performance of our method for two commonly used bath spectral functions, where we show that the actually required $\\chi$s are much smaller than the worst case.",

We propose a greedy spatial data partitioning algorithm enhancing their performance. We divide the data into the smaller subtensors before compression via exploitation of this trick. Furthermore, our analysis reveals a strong temporal dependency in the data's compressibility caused by its nature. Fixing the level of precision we observe a significant seasonal variation. Investigating this, we find that a temporal partitioning on a scale of approximately two days is nearly optimal for all tested tensor based formats. The combined application of these spatial and temporal strategies with tensor methods ultimately achieves a robust compression ratio of 5 times across the entire dataset.",

      "abstract": "A fundamental task in quantum information is to approximate a pure quantum state in terms of sparse states or, for a bipartite system, states of bounded Schmidt rank. The optimal deterministic approximation in each case is straightforward, and maximizes the fidelity: keep the largest entries or singular values. On the other hand, random mixtures of sparse states can achieve quadratically improved trace distances, and yield nontrivial bounds on other distance measures like the robustness. In this work, we give efficient algorithms for finding mixtures of sparse states that optimally approximate a given pure state in either trace distance or robustness. These algorithms also yield descriptions of efficiently samplable ensembles of sparse, or less-entangled, states that correspond to these optimal mixed approximations. This can be used for the truncation step of algorithms for matrix product states, improving their accuracy while using no extra memory, and we demonstrate this improvement numerically. Our proofs use basic facts about convex optimization and zero-sum games, as well as rigorous guarantees for computing maximum-entropy distributions.",

      "abstract": "Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problems are prevalent in various applications and are known to be NP-hard. The seminal work of Goemans and Williamson introduced a semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation for such problems, solvable in polynomial time that upper bounds the optimal value. Their approach also enables randomized rounding techniques to obtain feasible solutions with provable performance guarantees. In this work, we identify instances of QUBO problems where matrix multiplicative weight methods lead to quantum and quantum-inspired algorithms that approximate the Goemans-Williamson SDP exponentially faster than existing methods, achieving polylogarithmic time complexity relative to the problem dimension. This speedup is attainable under the assumption that the QUBO cost matrix is sparse when expressed as a linear combination of Pauli strings satisfying certain algebraic constraints, and leverages efficient quantum and classical simulation results for quantum Gibbs states. We demonstrate how to verify these conditions efficiently given the decomposition. Additionally, we explore heuristic methods for randomized rounding procedures and extract the energy of a feasible point of the QUBO in polylogarithmic time. While the practical relevance of instances where our methods excel remains to be fully established, we propose heuristic algorithms with broader applicability and identify Kronecker graphs as a promising class for applying our techniques. We conduct numerical experiments to benchmark our methods. Notably, by utilizing tensor network methods, we solve an SDP with $D = 2^{50}$ variables and extract a feasible point which is certifiably within $0.15\\%$ of the optimum of the QUBO through our approach on a desktop, reaching dimensions millions of times larger than those handled by existing SDP or QUBO solvers, whether heuristic or rigorous.",

      "abstract": "Calculating the quantum weight enumerator polynomial (WEP) is a valuable tool for characterizing quantum error-correcting (QEC) codes, but it is computationally hard for large or complex codes. The Quantum LEGO (QL) framework provides a tensor network approach for WEP calculation, in some cases offering superpolynomial speedups over brute-force methods, provided the code exhibits area law entanglement, that a good QL layout is used, and an efficient tensor network contraction schedule is found. We analyze the performance of a hyper-optimized contraction schedule framework across QL layouts for diverse stabilizer code families. We find that the intermediate tensors in the QL networks for stabilizer WEPs are often highly sparse, invalidating the dense-tensor assumption of standard cost functions. To address this, we introduce an exact, polynomial-time Sparse Stabilizer Tensor (SST) cost function based on the rank of the parity check matrices for intermediate tensors. The SST cost function correlates perfectly with the true contraction cost, providing a significant advantage over the default cost function, which exhibits large uncertainty. Optimizing contraction schedules using the SST cost function yields substantial performance gains, achieving up to orders of magnitude improvement in actual contraction cost compared to using the dense tensor cost function. Furthermore, the precise cost estimation from the SST function offers an efficient metric to decide whether the QL-based WEP calculation is computationally superior to brute force for a given QL layout. These results, enabled by PlanqTN, a new open-source QL implementation, validate hyper-optimized contraction as a crucial technique for leveraging the QL framework to explore the QEC code design space.",

For a signed Pauli Hamiltonian $H$ and any degree-$\\ell$ polynomial ${P}$, HDQI prepares a purification of the density matrix $\\rho_{P}(H) \\propto {P}^2(H)$ by solving a combination of two tasks: decoding $\\ell$ errors on a classical code defined by $H$, and preparing a pilot state that encodes the anti-commutation structure of $H$. Choosing $P(x)$ to approximate $\\exp(-\\beta x/2)$ yields Gibbs states at inverse temperature $\\beta$; other choices prepare approximate ground states, microcanonical ensembles, and other spectral filters. For local Hamiltonians, the corresponding decoding problem is that of LDPC codes. Preparing the pilot state is always efficient for commuting Hamiltonians, but highly non-trivial for non-commuting Hamiltonians. Nevertheless, we prove that this state admits an efficient matrix product state representation for Hamiltonians whose anti-commutation graph decomposes into connected components of logarithmic size. We show that HDQI efficiently prepares Gibbs states at arbitrary temperatures for a class of physically motivated commuting Hamiltonians -- including the toric code and Haah's cubic code -- but we also develop a matching efficient classical algorithm for this task. For a non-commuting semiclassical spin glass and commuting stabilizer Hamiltonians with quantum defects, HDQI prepares Gibbs states up to a constant inverse-temperature threshold using polynomial quantum resources and quasi-polynomial classical pre-processing. These results position HDQI as a versatile algorithmic primitive and the first extension of Regev's reduction to non-abelian groups.",

In the homogeneous (random translation-invariant) case, for any error tolerance in probability, the two-point function decays exponentially in the distance between the two sites, with a deterministic rate. In the i.i.d. case, the exponential decay still holds with a deterministic rate, with the probability approaching one exponentially fast in the distance. For strictly stationary ensembles with decaying spatial dependence, the correlation decay quantitatively reflects the mixing profile: ($\\rho$)-mixing yields polynomial bounds with high probability, while stretched-exponential (resp. exponential) decay in ($\\rho$) (resp.

To investigate the dissipative dynamics of the many-body quantum systems considered we perform numerical simulations employing matrix product states numerical methods. We show that by coupling atomic tunneling terms to the global field of a dissipative cavity we can stabilize at long times both finite currents and current-current correlations throughout the atomic chain. This is in contrast to the setup in which dissipation acts directly via local tunneling processes, where currents arise in a small portion of the system and the current-current correlations are rapidly decaying.",

We explore this phase transition for Haar-random quantum codes, in which the logical information is encoded in a random subspace of the physical Hilbert space. We focus on the spectrum of the encoded system density matrix as a function of the rate of uncorrelated, single-qudit errors. For low error rates, this spectrum consists of well-separated bands, representing errors of different weights. As the error rate increases, the bands for high-weight errors merge. The evolution of these bands with increasing error rate is well described by a simple analytic ansatz. Using this ansatz, as well as an explicit calculation, we show that the threshold for Haar-random quantum codes saturates the hashing bound, and thus coincides with that for random \\emph{stabilizer} codes. For error rates that exceed the hashing bound, typical errors are uncorrectable, but postselected error correction remains possible until a much higher \\emph{detection} threshold. Postselection can in principle be implemented by projecting onto subspaces corresponding to low-weight errors, which remain correctable past the hashing bound.",

We show that for a model that is completely agnostic, or unbiased, towards the function to be learned, a higher effective dimension likely results in a better trainability and performance.

To obtain these results, we derive an analytical expression of the FIM for Fourier models and identify the features controlling a model's effective dimension. This allows us to construct models with tunable effective dimension and bias, and to compare their training. We furthermore introduce a tensor network representation of the considered Fourier models, which could be a tool of independent interest for the analysis of QNN models.

Standard implementations of QSVT rely on block encodings of the Hamiltonian, which are costly to construct, requiring a logarithmic number of ancilla qubits, intricate multi-qubit control, and circuit depth scaling linearly with the number of Hamiltonian terms. In contrast, our algorithms use only a single ancilla qubit and entirely avoid block encodings. We develop two methods: (i) a direct randomization of QSVT, where block encodings are replaced by importance sampling, and (ii) an approach that integrates qDRIFT into the generalized quantum signal processing framework, with the dependence on precision exponentially improved through classical extrapolation. Both algorithms achieve gate complexity independent of the number of Hamiltonian terms, a hallmark of randomized methods, while incurring only quadratic dependence on the degree of the target polynomial. We identify natural parameter regimes where our methods outperform even standard QSVT, making them promising for early fault-tolerant quantum devices. We also establish a fundamental lower bound showing that the quadratic dependence on the polynomial degree is optimal within this framework. We apply our framework to two fundamental tasks: solving quantum linear systems and estimating ground-state properties of Hamiltonians, obtaining polynomial advantages over prior randomized algorithms. Finally, we benchmark our ground-state property estimation algorithm on electronic structure Hamiltonians and the transverse-field Ising model with long-range interactions. In both cases, our approach outperforms prior work by several orders of magnitude in circuit depth, establishing randomized QSVT as a practical and resource-efficient alternative for early fault-tolerant quantum devices.",

      "abstract": "We investigate the phase structure of a two-dimensional lattice CP(1) model with a $\\theta$ term. In particular, we aim to identify a critical region expected to exist along a $\\theta=\\pi$ line. To explore the phase structure non-perturbatively and avoid the sign problem, we employ the tensor renormalization group method. We make two improvements compared to previous tensor network studies. The first improvement involves refining the initial tensor. Specifically, we construct it using a quadrature method, which achieves higher accuracy compared to the conventional approach. The second improvement consists of analyzing the phase structure using the information of the conformal field theory, namely the central charge and the scaling dimensions, which can be accessed relatively easily via the tensor renormalization group method. Thanks to these improvements, we identify both the onset of the critical region, $\\beta_{\\rm c}=0.5952(8)$ and its universality class as the SU(2)${}_{k=1}$ Wess-Zumino-Witten model.",

As discrete implementations of the anti de-Sitter/conformal field theory (AdS/CFT) correspondence, such networks have created bridges between the fields of quantum information theory and quantum gravity. Adding SU(2) symmetry to the tensor network allows a direct connection to spin network states, a basis of the kinematic Hilbert space of loop quantum gravity (LQG). We consider a particular situation where the states can be interpreted as kinematic quantum states for three-dimensional quantum gravity. We show that important aspects of the AdS/CFT correspondence are realized in certain quantum states of the gravitational field in LQG, thus justifying, from first principles, a class of models introduced by [F. Pastawski et al., JHEP 06, 149 (2015)]. We provide examples of hyperinvariant tensor networks, but also prove constraints on their existence in the form of no-go theorems that exclude absolutely maximally entangled states as well as general holographic codes from local SU(2)-invariance. We calculate surface areas as expectation values of the LQG area operator and discuss further possible constraints as a consequence of a decay of correlations on the boundary.",

      "abstract": "The minimum weight matching (MWM) and maximum likelihood decoding (MLD) are two widely used and distinct decoding strategies for quantum error correction. For a given syndrome, the MWM decoder finds the most probable physical error corresponding to the MWM of the decoding graph, whereas MLD aims to find the most probable logical error. Although MLD is the optimal error correction strategy, it is typically more computationally expensive compared to the MWM decoder. In this work, we introduce an algorithm that approximates MLD with $K$ MWMs from the decoding graph. Taking the surface code subject to graphlike errors as an example, we show that it is possible to efficiently find the first $K$ MWMs by systematically modifying the original decoding graph followed by finding the MWMs of the modified graphs. For the case where the $X$ and $Z$ errors are correlated, despite the MWM of the decoding hypergraph cannot be found efficiently, we present a heuristic approach to approximate the MLD by finding the $K$ MWMs in the $X$ and $Z$ subgraphs. We benchmark the efficacy of our algorithm for the surface code subject to graphlike errors, the surface-square Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) code and surface-hexagonal GKP code subject to the Gaussian random displacement errors, showing that the fidelity approaches that of the exact MLD (for the first two cases) or the tensor-network decoder (for the last case) as $K$ increases.",

Exploiting multiscale self-organization in neuroscience and artificial intelligence requires a computational framework for modeling the effective non-equilibrium dynamics of stochastic neural trajectories. Non-equilibrium thermodynamics and representational geometry offer theoretical foundations, but we need scalable data-driven techniques for modeling collective properties of high-dimensional neural networks from partial subsampled observations. Renormalization is a coarse-graining technique central to studying emergent scaling properties of many-body and nonlinear dynamical systems. While widely applied in physics and machine learning, coarse-graining complex dynamical networks remains unsolved, affecting many computational sciences. Recent diffusion-based renormalization, inspired by quantum statistical mechanics, coarse-grains networks near entropy transitions marked by maximal changes in specific heat or information transmission. Here I explore diffusion-based renormalization of neural systems by generating symmetry-breaking representations across scales and offering scalable algorithms using tensor networks. Diffusion-guided renormalization bridges microscale and mesoscale dynamics of dissipative neural systems. For microscales, I developed a scalable graph inference algorithm for discovering community structure from subsampled neural activity. Using community-based node orderings, diffusion-guided renormalization generates renormalization group flow through metagraphs and joint probability functions. Towards mesoscales, diffusion-guided renormalization targets learning the effective non-equilibrium dynamics of dissipative neural trajectories occupying lower-dimensional subspaces, enabling coarse-to-fine control in systems neuroscience and artificial intelligence.",

While various classical algorithms for simulating noisy random circuits have been proposed, many of them rely on the anticoncentration property, which can fail when the circuit depth is small or under realistic noise models. We propose a new approach based on the exponential decay of conditional mutual information (CMI), a measure of tripartite correlations. We prove that exponential CMI decay enables a classical algorithm to sample from noisy random circuits -- in polynomial time for one dimension and quasi-polynomial time for higher dimensions -- even when anticoncentration breaks down. To this end, we show that exponential CMI decay makes the circuit depth effectively shallow, and it enables efficient classical simulation for sampling. We further provide extensive numerical evidence that exponential CMI decay is a universal feature of noisy random circuits across a wide range of noise models. Our results establish CMI decay, rather than anticoncentration, as the fundamental criterion for classical simulability, and delineate the boundary of quantum advantage in noisy devices.",

The algorithm exploits the property of stabilizer codes to separate entanglement into two pieces: one generated by the common stabilizer group and the other from the logical state. The low-nullity constraint ensures both pieces can be computed efficiently. Our algorithm can be applied to study the entanglement in sparsely $T$-doped circuits with possible Pauli measurements as well as certain classes of states that have both high entanglement and magic.

Using density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations, we discover two successive commensurate-incommensurate transitions of the non-conformal Pokrovsky-Talapov universality class, occurring (even) at zero magnetic field. The first transition marks the condensation of bound pairs of magnons into a critical phase with central charge $c=2$, emerging from a gapped period-4 phase. At the second transition, an incommensurate quadrupolar (or nematic) Luttinger liquid forms out of a gapped phase separation state, via the pairwise condensation of domain walls. We argue that both transitions involve the same underlying incommensurate nematic Luttinger liquid, and that the $c=2$ phase can be understood as a coexistence of a conventional (single-magnon type) and quadrupolar (two-magnon type) Luttinger liquids. Our results demonstrate that frustration alone is sufficient to drive continuous commensurate-incommensurate transitions of Mott type and stabilise incommensurate quasi-long-range order without doping.",

Beyond specific heat, uniform susceptibility, and compressibility, we introduce dopant-conditioned multi-point correlators that map how holes reshape local exchange. Nearest-neighbor hole pairs produce a strong cooperative response that reinforces antiferromagnetism on the adjacent parallel bonds, and single holes weaken nearby antiferromagnetic bonds; d-wave pairing correlations remain short-ranged over the same window.

By incorporating locally defined Clifford circuits within the fermionic formalism, we simulate benchmark models including the tight-binding and $t$-$V$ models. Our results show that Clifford disentangling removes the classically simulable component of entanglement, leading to a reduced bond dimension and improved accuracy in ground-state energy estimates.

We find that sharply localized and periodically recurring responses emerge only for specific types of perturbations, namely those that correspond to local density fields in the continuum limit.

      "abstract": "Topological properties of many-body entanglement in quantum spin liquids (QSLs), persisting at arbitrarily long distances, have been intensely explored over the past two decades, but mostly for QSLs viewed as {\\em closed} quantum systems. However, in experiments and potential quantum computing applications, candidate materials for this exotic phase of quantum matter will always interact with a dissipative environment, such as the one generated by bosonic quasiparticles in solids at finite temperature. Here we investigate the spatial structure and stability of entanglement in the Kitaev model of QSL made {\\em open} by sudden coupling to an infinite bosonic bath of Caldeira-Leggett type and time-evolved using the Lindblad quantum master equation in the Markovian regime (i.e., for weak coupling) or tensor network methods for open quantum systems in the non-Markovian regime (i.e., for strong coupling). From the time-evolved density matrix of QSL and its subregions, we extract genuine multipartite negativity (GMN), quantum Fisher information, spin-spin correlators, and expectation value (EV) of the Wilson loop operator. In particular, time-dependence of GMN offers the most penetrating insights: (i) in the Markovian regime, it remains non-zero in larger loopy subregions of QSL (as also discovered very recently for closed QSLs) up to temperatures comparable to Kitaev exchange interaction at which other quantities, such as EV of the Wilson loop operator, vanish; (ii) in the non-Markovian regime with pronounced memory effects, GMN remains non-zero up to even higher temperatures, while also acquiring non-zero value in smaller non-loopy subregions. The non-Markovian dynamics can also generate emergent interactions between spins, thereby opening avenues for tailoring properties of QSL via environmental engineering.",

Despite rapid progress in their experimental control, computational methods capable of accurately simulating open quantum many-body systems with complex long-ranged interactions at scale remain scarce. Here, we address this limitation by introducing an efficient and scalable approach to dissipative quantum lattices in one and two dimensions, combining matrix product operators and time-dependent variational Monte Carlo. We showcase the versatility, effectiveness, and unique methodological advantages of our algorithm by simulating the non-equilibrium dynamics and steady states of spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ lattices with competing algebraically-decaying interactions for as many as $N=200$ sites, revealing the emergence of spatially-modulated magnetic order far from equilibrium. This approach offers promising prospects for advancing our understanding of the complex non-equilibrium properties of a diverse variety of experimentally-realizable quantum systems with long-ranged interactions, including Rydberg atoms, ultracold dipolar molecules, and trapped ions.",

Herein, we uncover an intrinsic scaling law of the nonlocal magic resource and the bond dimension of matrix product states in Haar-random quantum circuits, that is, the nonlocal magic resource is converged on a bond dimension in logarithmic scale with the system size. It means, in the practical simulations of quantum circuits, merely small bond dimension suffices to bear with the dynamics of stabilizer R\\'{e}nyi entropy with rank $n=1,2$. On the other hand, the entanglement converges on a bond dimension exponentially scaled in the system size. This remarkable difference reveals that, while the simulation of entanglement on a classical computer is limited, the utilization of nonlocal magic resource as a characterization could make the simulation power much stronger. Furthermore, the intrinsic scaling enables an information separation between the nonlocal magic resource and the extra entanglement, achieving an indication that it is inappropriate to regard the entanglement as the driving force of the growth and spreading of nonlocal magic resource.",

This approach successfully captures the metal-insulator transition in the three-dimensional Anderson model and in the two-dimensional Anderson model with spin-orbit coupling. It can be also readily extended to multiorbital systems. We further generalize the formalism to interacting systems, showing that the one-dimensional spinless attractive model exhibits the expected metallic phase, consistent with previous studies. More importantly, we demonstrate the existence of a two-dimensional metallic phase in the presence of Hubbard interactions and disorder. This method offers a new perspective on Anderson localization and its interplay with interactions.",

The evolved quantum states produce feature distributions under local measurements, which, after simple post-processing and dimensionality reduction, naturally cluster according to different Hamiltonian parameters. Numerical simulations show that the evolution combined with local measurements can significantly amplify distinctions between quantum states, providing an efficient means to detect topological phase transitions.

As a result, a topological phase transition occurs as a function of the inter-leg hopping. When the inter-leg interaction is turned on, the topological phase survives, and we obtain an interaction induced topological phase transition as a function of interaction. Moreover, we show that for both the non-interacting and interacting cases, topological nature of the system survives even by altering the dimerization pattern in the dimerized leg, resulting in two topological phases of opposite character.

The rugged energy landscape, pronounced critical slowing down, and intrinsic ergodicity breaking render standard Monte Carlo methods severely inefficient, particularly for large systems at low temperatures. In this work, we introduce the Tensor Network Markov Chain Monte Carlo (TNMCMC) approach to address the issue. It generates large-scale collective updates in MCMC using tensor networks on the 2D slices of the 3D lattice, greatly improving the autocorrelation time and offering orders-of-magnitude speed-ups over conventional MCMC in generating unbiased samples of the Boltzmann distribution. We conduct numerical experiments on 3D spin glasses up to system size $64\\times 64\\times 64$ using a single CPU, and show that TNMCMC dramatically suppresses critical slowing down in large disordered systems, which usually require a supercomputer to perform MCMC simulations. Furthermore, we apply our approach to the 3-state Potts model up to system size $64\\times 64\\times 64$ using a single CPU, and show that the TNMCMC approach efficiently traverses the exponential barriers of the strong first-order transition, whereas conventional MCMC fails.

Originally introduced within algebraic quantum field theory, Haag duality has recently become pivotal in the operator-algebraic analysis of quantum many-body systems. In particular, it plays a key role in the description of anyonic excitations, which are widely believed to classify two-dimensional non-chiral gapped quantum phases of matter. Prior to this work, Haag duality had only been rigorously established for Kitaev's quantum double models with abelian input groups. In this paper, we establish that two-dimensional tensor network states based on biconnected $C^*$-weak Hopf algebras satisfy Haag duality. These states include as particular cases Kitaev quantum double and Levin-Wen string-net models, and we expect them to encompass representatives of all non-chiral phases. Our proof relies on deriving an operator-algebraic sufficient condition for Haag duality in finite systems, which we verify using tensor-network methods. As part of our analysis, we extend the tensor-network bulk-boundary correspondence, construct explicit commuting parent Hamiltonians for these models, and prove that in the biconnected case they satisfy the local topological quantum order condition.",

One of the species is subjected to Raman assisted tunneling, which leads to a synthetic flux within the framework of synthetic dimensions. In the deep Mott regime, the low energy physics is governed by an unconventional and highly tunable spin model, which is characterized by two distinct spin chains. The synthetic flux serves as an effective spin-orbit coupling, inducing Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions in one of the spin chains. The inter-species spin exchange interaction gives rise to the inter-chain coupling embodied as an isotropic XX interaction. Using time-evolving block decimation method for tensor network states, we compute order parameters, correlation functions and structure factors to identify the ground state magnetic phases. The DM interaction in one species, when combined with the inter-species spin-exchange interaction, can induce spiral magnetic order in the second, otherwise non-chiral species. Besides, the interplay of a transverse field applied to one spin chain and the inter-species coupling can drive both spin chains into a paramagnetic phase simultaneously. These results reveal that inter-species coupling serves as a powerful conduit for transmitting magnetic correlations, enabling exotic phases beyond the single-component perspective.",

In foundational work, Calabrese and Cardy demonstrated how this data governs the dynamics of certain global quenches to 1+1-dimensional conformal field theories. While the quasiparticle picture they introduce has been widely successful in both theory and experiment, their seminal prediction that the critical exponents are simply encoded in the relaxation rates of local observables is more challenging to investigate experimentally; in particular, the specific initial state required for their analysis is generated via imaginary time evolution. In this work, we examine the critical quench dynamics of local observables from two types of readily-accessible initial conditions: ground states and finite-temperature ensembles. We identify universal scaling collapses and scaling functions in both cases, utilizing a combination of conformal perturbation theory and tensor network numerics. For the finite-temperature quenches, we determine a regime in which the conformal field theory results are recovered, thereby allowing universal quantum critical data to be extracted from realistic quenches.",

KReTTaH adopts a nonparametric formulation by casting imputation as regression via reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. Parameter efficiency is achieved through tensors of fixed tensor-train (TT) rank, which reside on low-dimensional Riemannian manifolds, and is further enhanced via Hadamard overparametrization, which promotes sparsity within the TT parameter space. Learning is accomplished by solving a smooth inverse problem posed on the Riemannian manifold of fixed TT-rank tensors. As a representative application, the estimation of dynamic graph flows is considered. In this setting, KReTTaH exhibits flexibility by seamlessly incorporating graph-based (topological) priors via its inverse problem formulation. Numerical tests on real-world graph datasets demonstrate that KReTTaH consistently outperforms state-of-the-art alternatives-including a nonparametric tensor- and a neural-network-based methods-for imputing missing, time-varying edge flows.",

While compressed representations, such as the recently introduced quantics tensor train (QTT) format, alleviate the memory bottleneck, the efficiency of QTT-NEGF calculations is hindered by poor initializations and slow or unstable convergence of globally updated self-consistent iterations. Here, we introduce a predictor-corrector solver for QTT-NEGF simulations that combines dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) extrapolation with the recently proposed causality-preserving block-time-stepping updates. The DMD predictor supplies accurate initial guesses that reduce the iteration count of the calculation, while the block-time-stepping correction ensures stable convergence even for long propagation intervals. Applying this method to the Hubbard model on a $32\\times 32$ lattice within the nonequilibrium $GW$ approximation, we demonstrate stable propagation up to times of $t_\\mathrm{max}=512$ inverse hoppings, surpassing the capabilities of both matrix-based implementations and previous QTT solvers. Our contribution is twofold. (i) We integrate tensor dynamic mode decomposition with the QTT representation, which establishes a general framework that is not limited to NEGFs. (ii) We demonstrate its practical benefits in NEGF simulations, where it enables stable and efficient access to unprecedented timescales at high momentum resolution, thereby advancing controlled studies of long-time dynamics and nonequilibrium steady states in correlated lattice systems.",

We find that a monocycle electric field pulse tuned to the Drude absorption reduces the Drude weight, accompanied by a slight enhancement in the mid-infrared (mid-IR) spectral weight. However, this enhancement diminishes as the pulse intensity increases. In contrast, a pump pulse tuned to the mid-IR absorption only affects the Drude weight. This behavior arises because the mid-IR absorption originates from magnetic excitations that do not couple directly to photons. These predictions can be tested experimentally by applying ultrashort low-energy pump pulses to cuprate materials.",

Radical pair spin dynamics simulations including all nuclear spins have been a computational barrier due to exponential scaling memory requirements. We address this issue with a tensor network method for accurately simulating the full open quantum dynamics of radical pair systems, explicitly accounting for hyperfine interactions with up to 30 nuclear spins with additional benchmarking including 60 nuclei. By employing the matrix product state (MPS) and matrix product density operator (MPDO) representations, we mitigate the exponential scaling of Hilbert and Liouville spaces typically encountered in full quantum non-Markovian treatments. We demonstrate the power of these methods with biologically relevant flavin-tryptophan radical pair systems, where we investigate electron hopping processes between multiple radical pairs using Lindblad jump operators. These simulations precisely capture anisotropic spin dynamics, clearly identifying orientational dependence of the magnetic field, which enhances or diminishes the spin-selective product yield. These directional sensitivities highlight the critical dependence of the nuclear environment and underscore the necessity of fully quantum treatments in spin biophysics, offering critical insights into avian magnetoreception mechanisms. This work provides a robust computational framework applicable to a broad range of scientific realms, which include spin chemistry, quantum biology, and spintronics.",

Sentences are parsed with a Combinatory Categorial Grammar parser to yield distributional word tensors whose contractions mirror the sentence's grammatical derivation. To keep the model efficient, high-order tensors are factorized with tensor decompositions, reducing parameter count from tens of millions to under one million.

Focusing on the second order ring diagram, we find that the imaginary part of the self-energy diverges non-perturbatively: as a power law with exponent $-1/3$ near half filling, and logarithmically away from it. These divergences imply anomalous temporal relaxation of Green's functions, confirmed by infinite temperature tensor-network simulations. Our results demonstrate that anomalous relaxation and the breakdown of perturbation theory survive even at maximal entropy, which can be observed in cold-atom experiments probing the Hubbard chain at high temperatures.",

To complement the time-domain approach, we develop a high-resolution Chebyshev expansion method within the density matrix formalism, enabling direct access to spectral functions in the frequency domain. In the non-interacting limit, we derive exact analytical expressions for the Green's function, providing a benchmark for our numerical methods. As interactions are introduced, we observe a transition in the spectral function from a sharp peak at the free dispersion to a broadened two-band structure associated with hole and doublon excitations. These features are well captured by a Hubbard-I mean-field approximation, even at intermediate coupling. At infinite interaction strength ($U = \\infty$), we exploit a determinant representation of the Green's function to access both real-time and spectral properties. In this regime, the system retains a sharp, cosine-like momentum dispersion in frequency space, while the dynamics display nontrivial light-cone spreading with sub-ballistic scaling.

This raises a natural question: what happens at transitions between inequivalent gapless SPTs? We address this for the simplest known case among gapless SPTs protected by a unitary symmetry group acting faithfully on the low-energy theory. To this end, we consider a qutrit version of the nearest-neighbor XX chain. Trimerizing the chain explicitly breaks an anomalous symmetry and produces three distinct gapped SPT phases protected by a unitary $\\mathbb{Z}_3 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_3$ symmetry. Their phase boundaries are given by three inequivalent gapless SPTs without any gapped symmetry sectors, each described by a symmetry-enriched version of an orbifolded Potts$^2$ conformal field theory with central charge $c=\\frac{8}{5}$. We provide an analytic derivation of this critical theory in a particular regime and confirm its stability using tensor network simulations. Remarkably, the three gapless SPTs meet at a $c = 2$ multicritical point, where the protecting $\\mathbb{Z}_3 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_3$ symmetry exhibits a mixed anomaly with the $\\mathbb Z_3$ entangler symmetry that permutes the SPT classes. We further explore how discrete gauging gives dipole-symmetric models, offering insights into dipole symmetry-breaking and SPTs, as well as symmetry-enriched multiversality. Altogether, this work uncovers a rich phase diagram of a minimal qutrit chain, whose purely nearest-neighbor interactions make it a promising candidate for experimental realization, including the prospect of critical phases with stable edge modes.",

Therefore, we employ the Sobolev inequalities and their weighted analogues to sharpen the regularity bound, providing improvements in both classical Sobolev spaces and H{\\\"o}lder continuity estimates.

To further enhance the capacity of the method to solve the nonlinear filtering problem in a real-time manner, we reduce the complexity of the method under the assumption of a functional polyadic state drift $f$ and observation $h$. Finally, we perform numerical simulations to reaffirm our theory. For high-dimensional cubic sensor problems, our method demonstrates superior efficiency and accuracy in comparison to the particle filter (PF) and the extended Kalman filter (EKF).

Estimates of the universal critical properties are obtained to high accuracy on the quantum computer thanks to the large number of qubits utilized in the calculation. By successfully applying up to nearly 5000 entangling gates and 5000 non-unitary mid-circuit operations on systems up to 100 qubits, this experiment serves as a signpost on the route towards fault tolerance.",

      "abstract": "Tensor completion is an extension of matrix completion aimed at recovering a multiway data tensor by leveraging a given subset of its entries (observations) and the pattern of observation. The low-rank assumption is key in establishing a relationship between the observed and unobserved entries of the tensor. The low-rank tensor completion problem is typically solved using numerical optimization techniques, where the rank information is used either implicitly (in the rank minimization approach) or explicitly (in the error minimization approach). Current theories concerning these techniques often study probabilistic recovery guarantees under conditions such as random uniform observations and incoherence requirements. However, if an observation pattern exhibits some low-rank structure that can be exploited, more efficient algorithms with deterministic recovery guarantees can be designed by leveraging this structure. This work shows how to use only standard linear algebra operations to compute the tensor train decomposition of a specific type of ``fiber-wise\" observed tensor, where some of the fibers of a tensor (along a single specific mode) are either fully observed or entirely missing, unlike the usual entry-wise observations. From an application viewpoint, this setting is relevant when it is easier to sample or collect a multiway data tensor along a specific mode (e.g., temporal). The proposed completion method is fast and is guaranteed to work under reasonable deterministic conditions on the observation pattern. Through numerical experiments, we showcase interesting applications and use cases that illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",

      "abstract": "The XZZX code is a variant of the surface code designed to address biased noise in realistic quantum devices. For the XZZX code, we propose a decoder based on simulated annealing (SA). Our SA decoder can be readily and efficiently parallelized, by virtue of its simple MCMC-based algorithm. To prepare an initial configuration of SA, we propose to employ recovery chains obtained by a decoder which utilizes a kind of greedy matching graph algorithm. Although $Z$-biased noise is commonly assumed in real quantum devices, we focus on $Y$-biased noise, for which the minimum-weight perfect matching (MWPM) algorithm fails to decode accurately. Our numerical simulation for the code capacity noise model, where only data qubits suffer errors, confirmed that our SA decoder is more accurate than the MWPM decoder. Furthermore, our SA decoder attained the accuracy equivalent to that of the optimal decoder formulated by integer programming, called CPLEX decoder. In our greedy matching decoder, we randomly determine order of matching pairs of incorrect syndromes that have the same distance. This randomness brings about a variety of initial configurations of SA, which leads to faster convergence of our SA decoder. By comparing decoding times of our SA decoder, the CPLEX decoder, and matrix product state (MPS) decoder, all of which can handle $Y$-biased noise appropriately, we confirmed that our SA decoder is fastest if parallelized. This result implies a potential for combining of our greedy matching and SA decoder for practical use in quantum computing.",

When the simulator is noiseless, it is well understood that these problem-to-simulator mappings can be made as accurate as desired at the expense of simulator run-time. However, precisely because the simulator has to be run for a longer time to increase its accuracy, it is expected that noise in the quantum simulator catastrophically effects the simulator output. We show that, contrary to this expectation, these mappings remain stable to noise when considering the task of simulating dynamics of local observables in quantum lattice models. Specifically, we prove that in all of these mappings, local observables can be determined to a system-size independent, precision that scales sublinearly with the noise-rate in the simulator. Our results provide theoretical evidence that quantum simulators can be used for solving problems in many-body physics without or with modest error correction.",

Our approach employs the thermal tensor-network method for infinite-size 1D systems and the stochastic series expansion quantum Monte Carlo (SSE QMC) simulations for 2D systems, enabling precise calculations of the Gr\\\"uneisen ratio near QCPs.

Here, we present fully quantum simulations of H-atom scattering from the Ge(111)c(2x8) rest site using the hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM) with matrix product states (MPS). The system is modeled by mapping a density functional theory (DFT) potential energy surface onto a Newns-Anderson Hamiltonian. Our simulations reproduce the experimentally observed bimodal kinetic energy distributions, capturing both elastic and energy-loss channels. By systematically examining atom-surface coupling, incident energy, and isotope substitution, we identify the strong-coupling regime required to recover the experimental energy-loss profile. This regime suppresses the elastic peak, implying additional site-specific scattering channels in the observed elastic peak. Deuterium substitution further produces a subtle shift in the energy-loss peak, consistent with experiment. These results establish HEOM as a rigorous framework for quantum surface scattering, capable of capturing nonadiabatic dynamics beyond electronic friction and perturbative approaches.",

      "abstract": "Recent work has shown that for one-dimensional quantum states that can be effectively approximated by matrix product operators (MPOs), a polynomial number of copies of the state suffices for reconstruction. Compared to MPOs in one dimension, projected entangled-pair states (PEPSs) and projected entangled-pair operators (PEPOs), which represent typical low-dimensional structures in two dimensions, are more prevalent as a looped tensor network. However, a formal analysis of the sample complexity required for estimating PEPS or PEPO has yet to be established. In this paper, we aim to address this gap by providing theoretical guarantees for the stable recovery of PEPS and PEPO. Our analysis primarily focuses on two quantum measurement schemes: $(i)$ informationally complete positive operator valued measures (IC-POVMs), specifically the spherical $t$-designs ($t \\geq 3$), and $(ii)$ projective rank-one measurements, in particular Haar random projective measurements. We first establish stable embeddings for PEPSs (or PEPOs) to ensure that the information contained in the states can be preserved under these two measurement schemes. We then show that a constrained least-squares estimator achieves stable recovery for PEPSs (or PEPOs), with the recovery error bounded when the number of state copies scales linearly under spherical $t$-designs and polynomially under Haar-random projective measurements with respect to the number of qudits. These results provide theoretical support for the reliable use of PEPS and PEPO in practical quantum information processing.",

To resolve the sub-optimality issue, we analyze two numerical tools, one analytic method, and detail the relations between them. The numerical tools used are fidelity-preserving truncations and isometric gauge transformations leveraging Riemannian optimizations over entropic objective functions. In addition, by invoking the injectivity and symmetry constraints of the maximally mixed LPDO, we also present analytical closed-form expressions for the disentangler and discuss their relation to numerical optimizers. Our work shows how, by minimizing the resources required to represent key states of practical interest in experiment, the efficiency of tensor network algorithms can be substantially increased. This paves the path for uncovering tensor network's fundamental scalability limits and latent potential in representing the wide locus of mixed quantum states that are accessible on near-term quantum devices.",

State-of-the-art quantum simulators constitute a promising platform to address this problem. Here we study confinement in coupled chains of $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ LGTs coupled to matter fields, that can be mapped to a mixed-dimensional (mixD) XXZ model. We perform large-scale numerical matrix-product state calculations to obtain the phase diagram of this model, in which we uncover striped phases formed by the $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ charges that can be melted at finite temperature or by increasing the tunneling rate. To explore this setting experimentally, we use our quantum simulator constituted by erbium atoms with dipolar interactions in a quantum gas microscope, and observe the predicted melting of a stripe phase by increasing the particle tunneling rate. Our explorative experimental studies of thermal deconfinement of $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ charges motivate our further theoretical study of the mixD $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ LGT, in which we predict a confined meson gas at finite temperature and low magnetization where thermal fluctuations destroy stripes but enable spontaneous commensurate spin order.

While originally this puzzle was presented in the context of BPS two-sided black holes in two-dimensional supergravity, the negativity in fact persists for more general two-sided black holes in the presence of a large number of matter excitations. Since the entanglement and R\\'enyi entropies in ordinary quantum systems cannot be negative, resolving this puzzle is a necessary step towards understanding the quantum mechanical description of black holes. In this paper, we explain how to address the entanglement negativity puzzle, both in the original setting discussed by LMRS and in more general non-supersymmetric settings, by summing over all non-perturbative contributions to the gravitational path integral. We then interpret this result from the point of view of a dual matrix integral, which we use to extend our analysis beyond the regime of validity of the genus re-summation performed in the gravitational path integral. In this regime, positivity is rescued by new saddles of the matrix integral, a one-eigenvalue instanton and a two-eigenvalue instanton.

By tuning the doping level $\\delta$ and hopping ratio $t'/t$, we uncover six distinct quantum phases, several of which go far beyond the conventional paradigm of phase-coherent superfluidity (SF) expected for bosonic systems. In particular, in the presence of antiferromagnetic (AFM) order, doped holes are tightly bound into pairs, giving rise to a pair density wave (PDW) phase at low doping and small $|t'/t|$, which is suppressed on the $t'<0$ side, resulting in a disordered PDW state that lacks coherence of either individual bosons or pairs. Upon further doping, bosons can regain phase coherence and form a SF* state, characterized by condensation at emergent incommensurate momenta concurrent with an incommensurate magnetic order. On the $t'>0$ side, the sign-induced kinetic frustration inherently disfavors local AFM correlations, leading to a phase separation in which doped holes cluster into ferromagnetic (FM) domains spatially separated by undoped AFM regions. Upon further doping, this inhomogeneous state evolves into a uniform SF + $xy$-FM phase. Finally, we propose a concrete experimental scheme to realize both signs of $t'/t$ in Rydberg tweezer arrays, with an explicit mapping between model parameters and experimentally accessible regimes. Our results reveal competing and intertwined orders in doped antiferromagnets, which are relevant to central issues in high-$T_c$ superconductivity, reflecting the frustrated interplay between doped holes and spin background.",

These workflows must operate seamlessly across diverse simulators and hardware backends since no single simulator offers the best performance for every circuit type. Simulation efficiency depends strongly on circuit structure, entanglement, and depth, making a flexible and backend-agnostic execution model essential for fair benchmarking, informed platform selection, and ultimately the identification of quantum advantage opportunities. In this work, we extend the Quantum Framework (QFw), a modular and HPC-aware orchestration layer, to integrate multiple local backends (Qiskit Aer, NWQ-Sim, QTensor, and TN-QVM) and a cloud-based quantum backend (IonQ) under a unified interface. Using this integration, we execute a number of non-variational as well as variational workloads. The results highlight workload-specific backend advantages: while Qiskit Aer's matrix product state excels for large Ising models, NWQ-Sim not only leads on large-scale entanglement and Hamiltonian but also shows the benefits of concurrent subproblem execution in a distributed manner for optimization problems.

The multi-mode spectrum consists mainly of the intensive mode of a single correlated chain, which is surrounded and/or indented by numerous weak satellites. The number of securely fixed modes is eight at magnetic field parallel b-axis and twelve at magnetic field parallel a-axis. Besides of the multi-mode resonance observed at the transverse polarization of the microwave and static magnetic fields, we reveal a wide band of absorption by (k,-k)- pairs of quasiparticles at the longitudinal polarization. This kind of absorption of microwaves occurs both in the ordered and specific spin-liquid phases, revealing the presence of quasiparticles in the specific spin-liquid phase.",

      "abstract": "The spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model on the pyrochlore lattice(PAFH) is arguably the most well known strongly frustrated quantum magnet in three spatial dimension. As a close analogy of its two dimensional cousin, namely the spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model on the kagome lattice(KAFH), it has long been anticipated that the ground state of the spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ PAFH may host a novel quantum spin liquid. However, due to the rapid scaling of Hilbert space with the linear size of such a three dimensional system, study of the spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ PAFH is limited to rather small clusters and the nature of the ground state in the thermodynamic limit remains elusive. Here we apply a recently developed powerful algorithm to perform large scale unrestricted variational optimization of the ground state of the spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ PAFH. We find that the ground state of the spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ PAFH features a maximally resonating valence bond crystal(VBC) pattern with $2\\times2\\times2$ periodicity. There are at least four levels of hierarchical structure in such a VBC state, with the first and the second level of hierarchy related to the breaking of the inversion and the translational symmetry. We also find that an nearest-neighboring(NN)-RVB ansatz with $2\\times 2\\times 2$ periodicity can capture very well the qualitative feature of the maximally resonating VBC state. The ground state energy obtained from the NN-RVB ansatz and the generalized RVB ansatz extrapolate to $-0.4827J/site$ and $-0.4835J/site$ respectively in the thermodynamic limit. These results, which are obtained on clusters containing as many as $N=8^{3}\\times4=2048$ sites and wave function containing as many as $N_{v}=16777216$ variational parameters, constitute new benchmarks for the spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ PAFH.",

      "abstract": "The emergent practical applicability of the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) for approximate combinatorial optimization is a subject of considerable interest. One of the primary limitations of QAOA is the task of finding a set of good parameters. Parameter transfer is a phenomenon where QAOA angles trained on problem instances that are self-similar tend to perform well for other problem instances from that similar class. This suggests a potentially highly efficient and scalable non-variational learning method for QAOA angle finding. We systematically study QAOA parameter transferability from small problems (16, 27 qubits) onto large problem instances (up to 156 qubits) for heavy-hex graph Ising models with geometrically local higher order terms using the Julia based QAOA simulation tool JuliQAOA to perform classical angle finding for up to 49 QAOA layers. Parameter transfer of the fixed angles is validated using a combination of full statevector, Projected Entangled Pair States, Matrix Product State, and LOWESA numerical simulations. We find that the QAOA parameter transfer from single instances applied to unseen problem instances does not in general provide monotonically improving performance as a function of p - there are many cases where the performance temporarily decreases as a function of p - but despite this the transferred angles have a general trend of improved expectation value as the QAOA depth increases, in many cases converging close to the true ground-state energy of the 100+ qubit instances. We also sample the hardware-compatible Ising models using the ensemble of fixed QAOA angles on several superconducting qubit IBM Quantum processors with 127, 133, and 156 qubits. We find continuous solution quality improvement of the hardware-compatible QAOA circuits run on the IBM NISQ processors up to p=5 on ibm_fez, p=9 on ibm_torino, and p=10 on ibm_pittsburgh.",

Coulomb interactions and valley mixing effects are treated within the same microscopic framework, allowing us to systematically investigate spin and valley polarization transitions as functions of interaction strength and external tuning parameters. We calculate the low energy states for single and double QDs as a function of the number of electrons, identifying regimes of highly correlated multi-electron states. We confirm the presence of a spin-one ground state for two electrons. Then, we explore two coupled QDs with 4 electrons and extend the analysis to QD arrays. Using a mapping of the BLGQD chain to an effective bilinear-biquadratic (BLBQ) spin model, we demonstrate that BLGQD arrays can work as a quantum simulator for one-dimensional spin chains with emergent many-body topological phases.",

This method integrates memory kernel coupling theory (MKCT) with the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG), extending our recent work on MKCT to strongly correlated systems. The method establishes that correlation functions can be derived from the moments. Within our framework, operators and wavefunctions are represented as matrix product operators (MPOs) and matrix product states (MPSs), respectively. Crucially, the repeated application of the Liouville operator is achieved through an iterative procedure analogous to the DMRG algorithm itself. We demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of MKCT-DMRG by computing the spectral function of the Hubbard model. Furthermore, we successfully apply the method to compute the electronic friction in the Hubbard-Holstein model. In all cases, the results show excellent agreement with time-dependent DMRG (TD-DMRG) benchmarks. The advantage of MKCT-DMRG over TD-DMRG is the computational efficiency, which avoids expensive real-time propagation in TD-DMRG. These findings establish MKCT-DMRG as a promising and accurate framework for simulating challenging dynamical properties in strongly correlated quantum systems.",

In contrast, the three-site model lacks an intermediate phase and exhibits asymmetric edge localization and antiferromagnetic ordering in both positive and negative \\( J_z \\) regimes. We further examine the response of edge states to Ising perturbations. In the two-site model, zero-energy edge modes are topologically protected and remain robust up to a finite interaction strength. However, in the three-site model, where the edge states reside at finite energy, this protection breaks down. Despite this, the edge-localized nature of these states survives in the form of polarized modes whose spatial profiles reflect the non-interacting limit.",

The protocol takes as input real-space bipartitions of a state and returns a ZX contour diagram, $\\mathcal{D}_{\\partial A}$, displaying long-range graph connectivity only for long-range entangled states. We validate the protocol by showing that the contour diagrams of the toric and color codes are equivalent except for the number of non-local nodes, which differentiates their topological order. The number of these nodes is robust to the choice of the boundary and ground-state superposition, and they are absent for trivial states, even those with spurious entropy contributions. Our results single out ZX calculus as a tool to detect topological long-range entanglement by leveraging the advantages of diagrammatic reasoning against entropic diagnostics.",

Here, we study a Hofstadter-Hubbard model of spinful fermions on a square lattice, extended by nearest-neighbor interactions. Using large-scale density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations, we demonstrate the emergence of a spin-polarized $\\frac{1}{3}$-Laughlin-like FCI phase, characterized by a quantized many-body Chern number, a finite charge gap, and hidden off-diagonal long-range order.

The Lieb--Robinson bound sets a locality-based speed limit on information propagation, while the Small-Incremental-Entangling (SIE) theorem gives a universal constraint on entanglement growth. Yet, SIE bounds only total entanglement, leaving open the fine entanglement structure. In this work, we introduce Spectral-Entangling Strength, measuring the structural entangling power of an operator, and prove a Spectral SIE theorem: a universal limit for R\\'enyi entanglement growth at $\\alpha \\ge 1/2$, revealing a robust $1/s^2$ tail in the entanglement spectrum. At $\\alpha=1/2$ the bound is qualitatively and quantitatively optimal, identifying the universal threshold beyond which growth is unbounded. This exposes the detailed structure of Schmidt coefficients, enabling rigorous truncation-based error control and linking entanglement to computational complexity. Our framework further establishes a generalized entanglement area law under adiabatic paths, extending a central principle of many-body physics to general interactions. Practically, we show that 1D long-range interacting systems admit polynomial bond-dimension approximations for ground, time-evolved, and thermal states. This closes the quasi-polynomial gap and proves such systems are simulable with polynomial complexity comparable to short-range models. By controlling R\\'enyi entanglement, we also derive the first rigorous precision-guarantee bound for the time-dependent density-matrix-renormalization-group algorithm.

Xia (ICALP 2010) conjectured the converse of the Holant theorem, but a counterexample was found based on \\emph{vanishing} signatures, those which are Holant-indistinguishable from 0. We prove two near-converses of the Holant theorem using techniques from invariant theory. (I) Holant-indistinguishable $\\mathcal{F}$ and $\\mathcal{G}$ always admit two sequences of holographic transformations mapping them arbitrarily close to each other, i.e., their $\\text{GL}_q$-orbit closures intersect. (II) We show that vanishing signatures are the only true obstacle to a converse of the Holant theorem. As corollaries of the two theorems we obtain the first characterization of homomorphism-indistinguishability over graphs of bounded degree, a long standing open problem, and show that two graphs with invertible adjacency matrices are isomorphic if and only if they are homomorphism-indistinguishable over graphs with maximum degree at most three. We also show that Holant-indistinguishability is complete for a complexity class \\textbf{TOCI} introduced by Lysikov and Walter, and hence hard for graph isomorphism.",

A first-principle simulation requires a real-time, non-perturbative calculation of the quantum system. In this Letter, we perform such simulations using the tensor network method, which enables large-scale quantum many-body simulations by retaining only the most essential quantum states for collective behaviors. We focus on the massive Schwinger model, a low-dimensional analog of quantum chromodynamics (QCD), as they share important properties such as confinement and chiral symmetry breaking. Starting from an initial state that puts a localized excitation atop the vacuum and mimics the energy deposition from colliding nuclei, we observe hydrodynamic behavior consistent with Bjorken flow in all relevant degrees of freedom: energy density, fluid velocity, and bulk pressure. The time scale for hydrodynamic onset aligns with the thermalization time of the quantum distribution function.",

Second, by examining the evolution of the electric field and charge density, we observe the signal of spontaneous parity symmetry breaking phase transition in a dynamical system.

The interaction is parametrized by its magnitude and an angle defined by the relative orientation of the spins in different chains. From the entanglement spectrum, we identify the critical lines separating distinct magnetically ordered phases, with the interaction angle able to shift or fully suppress the transition. By increasing the coupling strength, the systems is driven through a quantum phase transition, leading to the formation of two types of in-plane antiferromagnetic stripes. The interaction strength sets stripe formation, while the angle controls the spins orientations. The chiral interaction also induces a non-trivial finite vector spin chirality with opposite orientation on the chains. We show that the vector spin chirality emerges smoothly from the decoupled limit and occurs for angles different from zero and $\\pi/2$, where collinear order is favored instead.",

These fixed-point tensor networks, obtained by triangulating Euclidean CFT path integrals, allow us to explicitly construct the canonical purification via cutting-and-gluing CFT path integrals. Employing modular flow in the large-$c$ limit, we demonstrate that these intrinsic CFT manipulations reproduce bulk geometric prescriptions, without assuming the AdS/CFT dictionary. The emergence of bulk geometry is traced to coarse-graining over heavy states in the large-$c$ limit. Universal coarse-grained BCFT data for compact 2D CFTs, through the relation to Liouville theory with ZZ boundary conditions, yields hyperbolic geometry on the Cauchy slice. The corresponding averaged replica partition functions reproduce all candidate EWs, arising from different averaging patterns, with the dominant one providing the correct RE and EW. In this way, many heuristic tensor-network intuitions in toy models are made precise and established directly from intrinsic CFT data.",

We solve the linear system arising at each time step from the implicit and semi-implicit time-marching schemes through a matrix-free preconditioned conjugate gradient (PCG) method, appositely designed to exploit the separation of variables induced by the tensor-train format. We assess the performance of our method through extensive numerical experimentation, demonstrating that the tensor-train design offers a robust and highly efficient alternative to the traditional approach.

Through unbiased quantum Monte Carlo sampling of RDMs across conventional O(2)/O(3) Wilson-Fisher transitions, and unconventional XY$^*$, and N\\'eel-VBS transitions in (2+1)d, we discover a dichotomy: Landau criticality amplifies GME within compact subregions, while non-Landau criticality redistributes entanglement into larger, loopy configurations.

Remarkably, the associated topological degeneracy is surprisingly encoded in the purely imaginary part of the entanglement entropy scaling-a feature absent in Hermitian systems.

The method interpolates geometry-induced weight and source terms in separable spline spaces and computes their tensor-train (TT) representations via the alternating minimal energy (AMEn) solver, enabling level-wise assembly of system operators using univariate quadrature. To recover separability in the adaptive setting, we reduce the active basis to tensor-product domains and partition active/non-active cells into a small number of Cartesian cuboids, so each contributes a Kronecker factor that is accumulated and rounded in TT. We realize the two-scale relation with truncation in low rank and assemble the global hierarchical operators in a block TT format suitable for iterative solvers. A prototype MATLAB implementation built on the GeoPDEs package and the TT-Toolbox demonstrates that, for model problems with moderately complex refinement regions, the approach reduces memory footprint and assembly time while maintaining accuracy; we also discuss limitations when ranks grow with geometric or refinement complexity. This framework advances scalable adaptive IgA with THB-splines, particularly in three dimensions.",

In this work, we address these shortcomings by proposing new scoring functions based on computationally efficient structured matrices with high ranks, including Block Tensor-Train (BTT) and Multi-Level Low Rank (MLR) matrices. On in-context regression tasks with high-dimensional inputs, our proposed scoring functions outperform standard attention for any fixed compute budget. On language modeling, a task that exhibits locality patterns, our MLR-based attention method achieves improved scaling laws compared to both standard attention and variants of sliding window attention. Additionally, we show that both BTT and MLR fall under a broader family of efficient structured matrices capable of encoding either full-rank or distance-dependent compute biases, thereby addressing significant shortcomings of standard attention.

Our framework is based on recent advances utilizing complex-time Krylov spaces, and we leverage these ideas to create a toolbox tailored to solve the challenging non-Hermitian eigenvalue problem ubiquitous in open quantum systems. At the example of the interacting Bose-Hubbard model driven by dissipation-assisted hopping, we demonstrate the high efficiency and accuracy, enabling us to perform a reliable finite-size scaling analysis of the spectral gap and demonstrating the existence of anomalous relaxation. This method unlocks the capability of spectral analysis of generic open quantum many-body systems, suitable also for non-Markovian environments.",

      "abstract": "The paradigm of considering open quantum systems -- i.e. focusing only on the system of interest, and treating the rest of the world as an effective environment -- has proven to be a highly effective way to understand a range of quantum systems, across areas of study such as quantum optics, cold atoms, superconducting qubits, and impurities in solid-state systems. A common approach in many of these contexts has been to consider simplified approaches based on the Born and Markov approximations. While these approximations are indeed often appropriate in contexts such as quantum optics, the widespread application of these approximations has been driven more by simplicity than by accuracy. In particular, these Markovian treatments will fail in many cases, such as when coupling to the environment is not weak, when the environment is structured and has resonances, when the system couples to low-frequency modes of the environment, or when the questions of interest involve the propagation of information through the environment. Despite the fact that many real problems are non-Markovian, the Markov approximation is still widely used, as it is often assumed that a fully non-Markovian treatment is too complex to be practical. In this perspective we discuss a recently developed set of techniques that address this challenge. Centering our discussion around the notion of the process tensor, we demonstrate that the generality of the process tensor concept, coupled with efficient tensor-network methods, opens the door to the description of a wide range of observable non-Markovian processes in a wide range of open quantum systems.",

Two major obstacles hinder progress: the large number of qubits required and the prohibitive cost of conventional nested optimization. In this work, we introduce a co-optimization framework that combines Density Matrix Embedding Theory (DMET) with Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) to address these limitations. This approach substantially reduces the required quantum resources, enabling the treatment of molecular systems significantly larger than previously feasible. We first validate our framework on benchmark systems, such as H4 and H2O2, before demonstrating its efficacy in determining the equilibrium geometry of glycolic acid C2H4O3, a molecule of a size previously considered intractable for quantum geometry optimization. Our results show the method achieves high accuracy while drastically lowering computational cost. This work thus represents a significant step toward practical, scalable quantum simulations, moving beyond the small, proof-of-concept molecules that have historically dominated the field. More broadly, our framework establishes a tangible path toward leveraging quantum advantage for the in silico design of complex catalysts and pharmaceuticals.",

In the absence of the $J_2$ interaction, we identify clear distinctions in the spectral functions in the fully dimerized phase across the exactly dimerized line for different magnitudes of the spins. In contrast to the spin-$1/2$ chain, where the spinon continuum dominates the spectral functions, the magnon modes are prominent in the spectral functions of the spin-$1$ and spin-$3/2$ chains. Through single mode approximation and valence bond solid approaches, we disentangle magnon and spinon contributions to the spectral functions. After including the $J_2$ interactions, for the spin-$1$ chain we trace the evolution of the dynamical structure factor along the phase transition line between the Haldane phase and the fully dimerized phase. We find that the excitation spectrum is a continuum along this line and the spectral gap closes as the order of the transition changes from first order to second order. Along the line of first-order transitions, the spinon-like domain walls are deconfined, and the model exhibits their confinement into discrete bound states away from the transition line. A similar phenomenon occurs in the spin-$3/2$ chain across the phase transition between partially dimerized to fully dimerized phases, revealing a universal spinon confinement phenomenon across first-order phase transitions. This study presents the dynamical structure factor corresponding to the ground state phase diagram and establishes a unified quasiparticle framework for understanding the fundamental nature of excitations across distinct quantum phases in frustrated $J_1$-$J_2$-$J_3$ Heisenberg spin chains.",

The MPO is then further disentangled into a more compact form. This enables a hybrid classical-quantum execution scheme, where the disentangling circuits are deployed on a quantum computer while the remainder of the network -- including the disentangled MPO -- runs on classical hardware. We introduce two complementary algorithms for MPO disentangling: (i) an explicitly disentangling variational method leveraging standard tensor-network optimization techniques, and (ii) an implicitly disentangling gradient-descent-based approach.

A small basis for the excitation tensors is formed based on a single diagonalization analogous to a single site DMRG step but for multiple states. Once overlap and Hamiltonian matrix elements are found, obtaining the excitation for any momentum only requires diagonalization of a tiny matrix, akin to a non-orthogonal band-theory diagonalization. The approach is based on an infinite MPS description of the ground state, and we introduce an extremely simple alternative to variational uniform matrix product states (VUMPS) based on finite system DMRG. For the $S=1$ Heisenberg chain, our method -- site basis excitation ansatz (SBEA) -- efficiently produces the one-magnon dispersion with high accuracy. We also examine the role of MPS gauge choices, finding that not imposing a gauge condition -- leaving the basis nonorthogonal -- is crucial for the approach, whereas imposing a left-orthonormal gauge (as in prior work) severely hampers convergence. We also show how one can construct Wannier excitations, analogous to the Wannier functions of band theory, where one Wannier excitation, translated to all sites, can reconstruct the single magnon modes exactly for all momenta.",

The number of parameters in these basis sets influences both the size of the training dataset required and the computational speed of the MLIP. Consequently, compressing MLIPs by reducing the number of parameters is a promising route to more efficient simulations. In this work, we use low-rank matrix and tensor factorizations under fixed-rank constraints to achieve this compression. In addition, we demonstrate that an algorithm with automatic rank augmentation helps to find a deeper local minimum of the fitted potential. The methodology is verified using the Moment Tensor Potential (MTP) model and benchmarked on multi-component systems: a Mo-Nb-Ta-W medium-entropy alloy, molten LiF-NaF-KF, and a glycine molecular crystal.

This tensor network coarse-grained model is demonstrated specifically on the pentacene crystal, where we evaluate the spectra and density of states. We show the natural emergence of bands of states in some cases, and characterize them.

As a guiding example, we focus on the anomalous $\\mathbb Z_2$ symmetry of the XX model, which manifests the mixed anomaly between its $U(1)$ momentum and winding symmetry. We show how this anomaly is embedded into the non-semisimple corepresentation category, providing a novel mechanism for realizing such anomalous symmetries on the lattice. Additionally, the representation category which describes the renormalization properties is semisimple and semi-monoidal, which provides a new class of mixed state renormalization fixed points. Finally, we show that up to a quantum channel, this anomalous $\\mathbb Z_2$ symmetry is equivalent to a more conventional MPO symmetry obtained on the boundary of a double semion model.

We address this gap by studying a three-legged antiferromagnetic quantum Ising ladder on a torus using tensor network methods, where topological frustration is induced by an odd number of spins along both spatial directions. Our results reveal the first instance in which topological frustration shifts the position of the quantum critical point.

In this Letter, we introduce such a representation for the family of Toric Code states by using Kitaev's Ladders as building blocks. We consider Toric Code states corresponding to various planar graphs and apply non-local dientanglers to qubits corresponding to non-contractible cycles that satisfy a topological constraint. We demonstrate that, independent of the geometry of the underlying graph, disentanglers convert Toric Code states into a tensor product of Kitaev's Ladder states. Since Kitaev's Ladders with arbitrary geometric configurations include the short-range entanglements, we conclude that the above universal and non-local pattern of entanglement between ladders is responsible of the long-range entanglement inherent in Toric Code states. Our result emphasizes in the capability of such non-local representations to describe topological order in ground-state wave functions of topological quantum systems.",

Here, we derive a realistic and flexible setup based on ultracold magnetic lanthanide atoms trapped in a one-dimensional optical lattice. Leveraging their large magnetic moments, we design a fermionic $t-J$ model with independently tunable hopping, spin-spin couplings, and onsite interaction. Through combined analytical and numerical analysis, we uncover a variety of many-body quantum phases$-$including superconducting and topological states. Crucially, in the regime of attractive onsite interaction we reveal that topology and superconductivity coexist, thus giving rise to an exotic state of matter: a topological triplet superconductor. We also outline a practical protocol to prepare and detect all discovered phases using current experimental techniques.

      "abstract": "Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods, such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), have significantly reduced the number of trainable parameters needed in fine-tuning large language models (LLMs). Subsequent developments of LoRA-style adapters have diverged into two main directions: (1) enhancing model expressivity with high-rank adapters, and (2) pushing for further parameter reduction, as exemplified by vector-based methods. However, these approaches present a trade-off, as achieving the expressivity of high-rank weight updates typically comes at the cost of sacrificing the extreme parameter efficiency offered by vector-based techniques. To address this issue, we propose a vector-based random \\underline{\\textbf{Te}}nsor network for high-\\underline{\\textbf{R}}ank \\underline{\\textbf{A}}daptation (TeRA), a novel PEFT method that achieves high-rank weight updates while retaining the parameter efficiency of vector-based PEFT adapters. This is achieved by parameterizing the tensorized weight update matrix as a Tucker-like tensor network (TN), in which large randomly initialized factors are frozen and shared across layers, while only small layer-specific scaling vectors, formed by entries in diagonal factor matrices, are trained. This design effectively decouples the rank of the weight update matrix from the number of trainable parameters. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that TeRA matches or even outperforms high-rank adapters, while requiring a trainable parameter count similar to vector-based methods. Theoretical analysis and ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of our approach.",

By systematically analyzing the ground-state fidelity, low-lying energy spectra, exciton superfluid and stripe order parameters, and ground-state energy derivatives, we identify a direct and continuous quantum phase transition between two distinct symmetry-breaking phases by tuning the layer separation: an exciton superfluid phase with spontaneous $U(1)$ symmetry breaking at small separation, and a unidirectional charge density wave with broken translational symmetry at large separation.

Here, we present numerical evidence for robust superconductivity in a triangular Hubbard-Hofstadter model at $\\pi/2$ flux per plaquette. Employing infinite density matrix renormalization group calculations on infinite cylinders of finite circumference, we observe superconducting ground states for a wide range of dopings, whose pair-correlations strengthen as the 2D limit is approached. At a density of one electron per site, Hubbard interactions have been reported to drive the insulating parent state of the superconductor from an integer quantum Hall (IQH) state to a chiral spin liquid (CSL). Our findings give credence to a recent proposal that proximity to the IQH-CSL transition serves to make chiral superconductivity energetically favorable on doping, and also correctly predicts the nature of the edge modes in the superconductor. On the CSL side, this suggests the superconductor can be thought of as arising from Laughlin's `anyon superconductivity' mechanism. Thus the Hubbard-Hofstadter model studied here offers a clean and experimentally accessible setup, potentially realizable in moir\\'e heterostructures, for exploring the properties of anyonic matter at finite density and the interplay of topological order, quantum criticality and superconductivity.",

These studies are particularly relevant-though not limited-to the recently discovered bilayer nickelate superconductor La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$. We focus on a ferromagnetic (FM) Kondo lattice model with mobile electrons in the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital coupled to the localized spin moments in $d_{z^2}$ orbital through a large Hund's coupling $J_H$. In the large $J_H$ limit, the model reduces to the type II t-J model with a mixture of spin-half singlon states and spin-one doublon states. We summarize DMRG results on the Luther-Emery liquid in one dimensional chain and two-leg ladder. Then we mainly focus on bilayer square lattice and show that a large inter-layer coupling $J_\\perp$ of $d_{z^2}$ orbital can induce strong inter-layer pairing of $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital. In the strong $J_\\perp$ limit, a kinetic-energy driven high $T_c$ superconductivity is demonstrated in an ideal model with only a single hopping term. Furthermore, the model predicts a symmetric pseudogap metal-dubbed `second Fermi liquid\"-in the underdoped regime, yielding a phase diagram analogous to that of hole-doped cuprates. The bilayer Kondo model therefore, presents a promising platform for both realizing higher-Tc superconductors and exploring non-Fermi liquid physics. We also comment on the possible limitations of the current models for the bilayer nickelate material and point out some future directions.",

Moreover, by optimizing over all mean-field states, we map out a phase diagram -- featuring six distinct phases -- of the nearest-neighbor Heisenberg Hamiltonian on the trellis lattice. Going beyond mean field, we also assess equal-time and dynamical spin structure factors of these phases using density-matrix renormalization group and Keldysh pseudofermion functional renormalization group calculations.

By leveraging an electric-field-based method for mass renormalization, we reliably tune to maximal twist and establish the method's applicability in the two-flavor model. Once mass renormalization is included, the pion mass exhibits rapid convergence to the continuum limit. Finite-volume effects are addressed using two complementary approaches: dispersion relation fits and finite-volume scaling. Our results show excellent agreement with semiclassical predictions and reveal a milder volume dependence for twisted mass fermions compared to staggered and Wilson discretizations. In addition, we observe clear isospin-breaking effects, suggesting intriguing parallels with lattice QCD. These findings highlight the advantages of twisted mass fermions for Hamiltonian simulations and motivate their further exploration, particularly in view of future applications to higher-dimensional lattice gauge theories.",

At half filling of the lowest Landau level, it has been predicted that ``composite fermions'' -- emergent quasiparticle of an electron with two magnetic flux quanta -- can experience zero net magnetic field and form a Fermi sea, dubbed composite Fermi liquid (CFL). However, the seemingly simple appearance of CFL is a strongly correlated quantum many-body state in disguise, and to solve it in a controlled manner is extremely difficult, to the level that the thermodynamic properties of CFL is still largely unknown. In this work, we perform state-of-the-art thermal tensor network simulations on the $\\nu=1/2$ Landau level systems, and observe low-temperature power-law behaviour of the specific heat, signaling the gapless nature of CFL. More importantly, the power is extracted to be closed to $2/3$, clearly deviated from the ordinary linear-$T$ Fermi liquid behaviour, suggesting the coupling between the CFs and the dynamical emergent gauge field and therefore revealed the quantum many-body aspect of the CFL state.

Each SI step is solved using a preconditioned low-rank conjugate gradient (CG) method with a diffusion preconditioner. To further improve efficiency, we introduce an adaptive inexact strategy that dynamically relaxes the inner CG tolerance during early SI iterations. The method exploits the tensor-product structure of the discretized operators to perform all matrix-vector operations in low-rank form. Numerical experiments on 2D2V benchmark problems, including diffusion-dominated, transport-dominated, and multiscale problems, demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves errors on the order of $10^{-4}$ to $10^{-5}$ relative to full-rank reference solutions, while reducing the degrees of freedom by up to two orders of magnitude. In the diffusion-dominated case, the low-rank solver achieves speedups exceeding $90\\times$ over its full-rank counterpart and remains competitive in solving challenging transport-dominated and multiscale problems while providing substantial storage savings.

To resolve this inconsistency, we conduct a systematic comparison using Renormalizer, a unified software framework for matrix product states (MPS) and tree tensor network states (TTNS). By revisiting the benchmark P3HT:PCBM heterojunction model, we show that the observed discrepancies arise primarily from insufficient bond dimensions.

Further refinement using an extrapolation scheme and an optimized tensor network structure lowers the difference to approximately 2%.

Solving the dynamics of an OQS in a quantum many-body bath has been considered a computationally hard problem because of the dimensionality curse. Here, considering that full knowledge of the bath dynamics is unnecessary for describing the reduced dynamics of an OQS, we prove a polynomial complexity theorem, that is, the number of independent equations required to fully describe the dynamics of an OQS increases at most linearly with the evolution time and polynomially with the bath size. Therefore, efficient computational algorithms exist for solving the dynamics of a small-sized OQS (such as a qubit or an atom). We further prove that, when the dynamics of an OQS and the bath is represented by a tensor network, a tensor contraction procedure can be specified such that the bond dimension (i.e., the range of tensor indices contracted in each step) increases only linearly (rather than exponentially) with the evolution time, providing explicitly efficient algorithms for a wide range of OQS's. We demonstrate the theorems and the tensor-network algorithm by solving two widely encountered OQS problems, namely, a spin in a Gaussian bath (the spin-boson model) and a central spin coupled to many environmental spins (the Gaudin model). This work provides approaches to understanding dynamics of OQS's, learning the environments via quantum sensors, and optimizing quantum information processing in noisy environments.",

      "abstract": "As the number of qubits in a sensor increases, the complexity of designing and controlling the quantum circuits grows exponentially. Manually optimizing these circuits becomes infeasible. Optimizing entanglement distribution in large-scale quantum circuits is critical for enhancing the sensitivity and efficiency of quantum sensors [5], [6]. This paper presents an engineering integration of reinforcement learning with tensor-network-based simulation (MPS) for scalable circuit optimization for optimizing quantum sensor circuits with up to 60 qubits. To enable efficient simulation and scalability, we adopt tensor network methods, specifically the Matrix Product State (MPS) representation, instead of traditional state vector or density matrix approaches. Our reinforcement learning agent learns to restructure circuits to maximize Quantum Fisher Information (QFI) and entanglement entropy while reducing gate counts and circuit depth. Experimental results show consistent improvements, with QFI values approaching 1, entanglement entropy in the 0.8-1.0 range, and up to 90% reduction in depth and gate count. These results highlight the potential of combining quantum machine learning and tensor networks to optimize complex quantum circuits under realistic constraints.",

Although an increasing number of experiments report anomalous spin excitation continua in such systems, their microscopic interpretation remains an open challenge. Here, we investigate the spin dynamics of the triangular-lattice antiferromagnet in its 1/3-plateau phase using two complementary non-perturbative approaches: exact diagonalization in a truncated Hilbert space for a gas of elementary excitations (THED) and matrix product state (MPS) simulations. Alongside cross-validation between these methods, we benchmark our results against inelastic neutron scattering (INS) data. The THED analysis confirms the presence of two-magnon bound states and identifies the anomalous scattering continuum observed in both MPS and INS as a two-magnon resonance, arising from hybridization between the bound state and the two-magnon continuum. Furthermore, THED reveals bound states overlapping with the continuum, enriching the interpretation of continuum anomalies. More broadly, THED provides a robust framework for investigating anomalous spin excitation continua and bound-state effects in other materials with gapped spectra. Its combination of accuracy and computational efficiency makes it a powerful tool for extracting reliable microscopic models in semiclassical regimes.",

By preparing and manipulating these ground states, we address fundamental problems in equational reasoning, including the word problem, i.e., determining whether two expressions are equivalent, counting the number of equivalent expressions, and identifying structural properties of equivalence classes. We demonstrate a quantum-inspired version of the algorithm using tensor network simulations by solving instances involving up to $10^{28}$ equivalent expressions, well beyond the reach of standard classical graph exploration techniques.

Our algorithms also allow a systematic truncation procedure to achieve approximate simulation. To benchmark our approach, we study the dynamics of all-to-all monitored quantum circuits with a sub-extensive rate of $T$-gates per unit of circuit depth, where we can simulate previously inaccessible system sizes and depths.

These processes show fractional characteristics with varying Hurst exponents. We argue that the continuous quantum symmetries such as U(1) or SU(2) of the XXZ chain give rise to $H=0$ with logarithmic scaling. Processes generated without these symmetries can produce $H \\geq0.5$ but likely not $H < 0.5$ unless the dominant term responsible for $H=0.5$ gets canceled.

A common strategy is to embed the system-environment into a larger unitary framework, but this obscures the intrinsic complexity of the reduced system dynamics. Here, we investigate the computational complexity of simulating open quantum systems, focusing on two physically relevant parameters, correlation length and mixing time, and explore whether it can be comparable (or even lower) to that of simulating their closed counterparts. In particular, we study the role of dissipation in simulating open-system dynamics using both quantum and classical methods, where the classical complexity is characterised by the bond dimension and operator entanglement entropy. Our results show that dissipation affects correlation length and mixing time in distinct ways at intermediate and long timescales. Moreover, we observe numerically that in classical tensor network simulations, classical complexity does not decrease with stronger dissipation, revealing a separation between quantum and classical resource scaling.",

For ferromagnetic couplings ($J<0$): a local-moment (LM) phase at weak $|J|$, where the impurity remains unscreened with $S_{\\mathrm{imp}}\\to \\ln 2$ as $T \\to 0$ but exhibits shallow undershoots at intermediate scales; and a \\textit{ferromagnetic bound-mode (FBM) phase} at strong $|J|$, where $S_{\\mathrm{imp}}=\\ln 2$ in both UV and IR limits, yet develops an intermediate-temperature undershoot. We provide an analytic understanding of this behavior, showing that the undershoots originate from the fractionalization of the Hilbert space into several towers of states: for antiferromagnetic couplings this occurs only at strong $J$, driven by boundary-localized bound modes, while for ferromagnetic couplings undershoots occur for all $J<0$, becoming deeper with increasing $|J|$ and vanishing as $J\\to 0^{-}$. These bound modes screen the impurity. Incorporating the bound modes and edge states provides a complete analytic understanding of this phenomenon and yields closed expressions for the impurity contribution to free energy and entropy that are valid across all phases.

We provide an explicit algorithm for the general case as well as simple analytical expressions for the chain parameters in the wide-band and infinite-chain limits.

On the other hand, since the mixed state under $X+ZZ$ decoherence satisfies the Kramers-Wannier self-duality in a weak sense, the Ising criticality of the pure state can be partially preserved in the mixed system. By making use of the combination of the doubled Hilbert space formalism and matrix product states, we carry out extensive numerical study to elucidate the mixed state criticality. We find that under decoherence up to moderate strength, the mixed states on the critical line have properties of the Ising CFT, where $c=1/2$, $\\eta=0.25$ and, $\\nu=1$. These values of the central charge and critical exponents contrast with the ones in the $c=1$ orbifold boson CFT describing the critical state of the qAT model. In addition, we also observe the threshold of the mixed Ising CFT. The strong decoherence washes out the remnant Ising criticality and induces strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking.",

      "abstract": "We study an extended spin-$1/2$ antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model on the triangular lattice, which includes both nearest- and next-nearest-neighbor interactions, as well as a scalar chiral term. This model exhibits a rich phase diagram featuring several competing phases: different quantum spin liquids and various magnetically ordered states, including coplanar $120^\\circ$ order, stripe order, and non-coplanar tetrahedral order. We employ large-scale matrix product state simulations optimized for GPUs to obtain high-resolution dynamical responses. Our calculations reveal the spectral features across both ordered and liquid regimes of the phase diagram, which we analyze in comparison with analytical predictions and field-theoretical approaches. We identify unique signatures of the ordered phases in the form of gapless Goldstone modes at the ordering wave vectors. Our results in the $J_1-J_2$ quantum spin-liquid regime are indicative of a $U(1)$ Dirac spin liquid. In the chiral spin-liquid phase, we find signatures of spinons as the fractional excitations of the underlying theory, manifested as the onset of a two-spinon continuum that agrees with predictions from the Kalmeyer-Laughlin ansatz for the ground-state wave function, and collective modes that can be viewed as spinon bound states. We discuss finite-size effects, their consistency with the presumptions from field-theory, and review the dynamical structure factor with regard to experimentally relevant features such as the occurrence of highly dispersive signals and the global distribution of spectral weight.",

Non-invertible symmetries, as exemplified by the non-local Kramers-Wannier duality in one dimension, can also be represented using unitary networks.

Of particular interest are RTNs on hyperbolic geometries, with local tensors typically chosen from the unitary Haar measure, that model critical boundary states of holographic bulk-boundary dualities. In this work, we elevate static pictures of ensemble averages to a dynamical one, to show that RTN states exhibit equilibration of time-averaged operator expectation values under a highly generic class of Hamiltonians with non-degenerate spectra. We prove that RTN states generally equilibrate at large bond dimension and also in the scaling limit for three classes of geometries: Those of matrix product states, regular hyperbolic tilings, and single \"black hole\" tensors. Furthermore, we prove a hierarchy of equilibration between finite-dimensional instances of these classes for bulk and boundary states with small entanglement. This suggests an equivalent hierarchy between corresponding many-body phases, and reproduces a holographic degree-of-freedom counting for the effective dimension of each system. These results demonstrate that RTN techniques can probe aspects of late-time dynamics of quantum many-body phases and suggest a new approach to describing aspects of holographic dualities using techniques from statistical mechanics.",

We derive a universal criterion, $n \\gg \\alpha^2 t^2$, linking discretization $n$, disorder strength $\\alpha$, and evolution duration $t$. This sets the resolution required for faithful disorder averaging and shows that encoding is most efficient in the weak-disorder, typically chaotic regime. Applied to the disordered transverse-field Ising model, SeTN shows that the spectral form factor is governed by the leading transfer-matrix eigenvalue, in contrast to the kicked Ising model. SeTN thus provides a novel framework for probing the disorder-driven dynamical phenomena in many-body quantum systems.",

We also explored the usage of CCSD natural orbitals ($\\tilde{d}_{\\gamma,\\mathrm{NO}}$) and its effect on the active space size and the metric. The proposed diagnostic can also be applied to other wavefunction approximations, and it has the potential to provide a quality measure for post-Hartree-Fock procedures in general.",

To address the challenge of reconciling geometric variability with fixed-dimensional snapshot representations, we adopt a deformation-based strategy that maps a reference configuration to each parameterized domain. Furthermore, we introduce a localization procedure to construct dictionaries of reduced subspaces and hyper-reduction approximations, which are obtained via matrix discrete empirical interpolation in our work. We extend the proposed framework to saddle-point problems by adapting the supremizer enrichment strategy to unfitted methods and deformed configurations, demonstrating that the supremizer operator can be defined on the reference configuration without loss of stability.

A central challenge in Hamiltonian formulations of gauge theories is the unbounded local Hilbert space associated with gauge degrees of freedom. In one spatial dimension, Gauss's law permits these gauge fields to be integrated out, yielding an effective Hamiltonian with long-range interactions among matter fields. We construct efficient matrix product operator (MPO) representations of these Hamiltonians directly in the thermodynamic limit. Our formulation naturally includes background fields and $\\theta$-terms, requiring no modifications to the standard iDMRG algorithm. This provides a broadly applicable framework for 1+1D gauge theories and can be extended to quasi-two-dimensional geometries such as infinite cylinders, where tensor-network methods remain tractable. As a benchmark, we apply our construction to the Schwinger model, reproducing expected features including confinement, string breaking, and the critical behavior at finite mass. Because the method alters only the MPO structure, it can be incorporated with little effort into a wide range of iMPS and infinite-boundary-condition algorithms, opening the way to efficient studies of both equilibrium and non-equilibrium gauge dynamics.",

The emerging picture shows three different stages of evolution: an initial nucleation of small bubbles, followed by semi-classical bubble growth, which in turn is halted by the lattice phenomenon of Bloch oscillations. Furthermore, we find that the resonant bubble only plays a significant role in a certain region of parameter-space. However, when significant, it does lead to an approximately constant decay rate during the intermediate stage. Moreover, this rate is in quantitative agreement with the analytical result of Rutkevich (Phys. Rev. B 60, 14525) for which we provide an independent derivation based on the Gaussian ansatz.",

We compare our recently developed Tensor Product Selected Configuration Interaction (TPSCI) with Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) for computing exchange coupling constants in six transition metal systems, including dinuclear Cr, Fe, and Mn complexes and a tetranuclear Ni-cubane. TPSCI uses a locally correlated tensor product state basis to capture electronic structure efficiently while maintaining interpretability. From calculations on active spaces ranging from (22e,29o) to (42e,49o), we find that TPSCI consistently yields higher variational energies than DMRG due to truncation of local cluster states, but provides magnetic exchange coupling constants (J) generally within 10-30 cm$^{-1}$ of DMRG results. Key advantages include natural multistate capability enabling direct J extrapolation with smaller statistical errors, and computational efficiency for challenging systems. However, cluster state truncation represents a fundamental limitation requiring careful convergence testing, particularly for large local cluster dimensions. We identify specific failure cases where current truncation schemes break down, highlighting the need for improved cluster state selection methods and distributed memory implementations to realize TPSCI's full potential for strongly correlated systems.",

We present a matrix product state (MPS) solver for the GP equation that efficiently compresses the wavefunction by truncating weak interlength-scale correlations. This approach reduces memory use by factors ranging from 10x to over 10,000x compared to DNS. We benchmark our approach on nonlinear excitations, namely dark solitons (1D) and quantized vortices (2D, 3D), capturing key dynamics like Kelvin wave propagation and vortex ring emission in the case of vortex line reconnection. For turbulent states composed of multiple nonlinear excitations, we find that the memory compression of the MPS representation is directly proportional to the soliton or vortex densities. We also accurately reproduce established results from two-point correlation functions and energy spectra, where we recover the incompressible kinetic energy spectrum with little memory overhead. These results demonstrate the representative capabilities of the MPS ansatz for quantum turbulence and pave the way for studying this nonequilibrium state using previously-prohibited system sizes to uncover possible new physics.",

In this paradigm, only the inserted adapters are fine-tuned, without the need for training the original VLM backbone. Existing works scale adapters by integrating them into every layer of VLMs to increase the capacity of adapters. However, these methods face two primary limitations: 1) limited compression rate due to ignoring cross-layer redundancy, and 2) limited representational capacity across homogeneous adapters. In this paper, we propose a novel vision-language fine-tuning framework based on cross-layer tensor ring decomposition (TRD) with the integration and collaboration of diverse adapters, called AdaRing, achieving ultra-light parameter-efficient adaptation of VLMs on various tasks. To remove the high redundancy that exists among adapters across layers, we exploit the tensor-level low-rankness to formulate adapters as layer-shared tensor cores and layer-specific slices. Moreover, guided by generalization-aware fine-tuning, diverse rank-driven adapters cooperate to handle tasks that require different representations. Our experiments show that the proposed AdaRing achieves the state-of-the-art performance while reducing average training parameters by 90%.",

On the $L_y = 3$ cylinder ($L_y$ is the number of unit cells along the circumference direction), we establish a quantum phase diagram with tuning $t_2 > 0$ and $J_2 > 0$, showing an emergent Fermi-liquid-like phase driven by increased $t_2$ and $J_2$, which sits at the neighbor of the previously identified charge density wave (CDW) phase. Compared with the CDW phase, the charge order is significantly suppressed in the Fermi-liquid-like phase, and most correlation functions are greatly enhanced with power-law decay. In particular, we find the absence of hole pairing and a strong three-sublattice magnetic correlation. On the wider $L_y = 4$ cylinder, this Fermi-liquid-like phase persists at low doping levels, strongly suggesting that this state might be stable in the two-dimensional kagome system.",

Here we use analytical arguments and numerical evidence to illuminate how spontaneous symmetry breaking of a non-invertible symmetry is similar yet distinct from ordinary, invertible, symmetry breaking. We consider one-dimensional chains of group-valued qudits, whose local Hilbert space is spanned by elements of a finite group $G$ (reducing to ordinary qubits when $G=\\mathbb{Z}_2$). We construct Ising-type transverse-field Hamiltonians with Rep($G$) symmetry whose generators multiply according to the tensor product of irreducible representations (irreps) of the group $G$. For non-Abelian $G$, the symmetry is non-invertible. In the symmetry broken phase there is one ground state per irrep on a closed chain. The symmetry breaking can be detected by local order parameters but, unlike the invertible case, different ground states have distinct entanglement patterns. We show that for each irrep of dimension greater than one the corresponding ground state exhibits string order, entanglement spectrum degeneracies, and has gapless edge modes on an open chain -- features usually associated with symmetry-protected topological order. Consequently, domain wall excitations behave as one-dimensional non-Abelian anyons with non-trivial internal Hilbert spaces and fusion rules. Our work identifies properties of non-invertible symmetry breaking that existing quantum hardware can probe.",

The Gutzwiller projection can be implemented within the tensor network formalism, giving rise to a new PEPS of bond dimension $D = 4$. We, moreover, apply very recent state-of-the-art tensor network tools to evaluate these phases. In particular, we analyze its entanglement entropy scaling and find no topological correction to the area law, indicating that the state is not intrinsically topologically ordered. Its entanglement spectrum shows a clear cusp at momentum zero, similar to non-interacting Euler insulators, and the spectrum of the transfer operator indicates that the state is gapped, which could imply non-intrinsic topological features. Finally, the static structure factor displays Bragg peaks, indicating the simultaneous presence of local order.",

Standard indicators of chaos such as damage spreading, show that these systems exhibit sensitivity to initial conditions in the classical setting. Here, we address their quantum chaoticity by studying the time evolution of local operator entanglement (LOE). We show that the behaviour of LOE in random permutation circuits depends on the dimension of the local configuration space q. When q = 2, i.e. the circuits act on qubits, random permutations are Clifford and the LOE of any local operator is bounded by a constant, indicating that they are not truly chaotic. On the other hand, when the dimension of the local configuration space exceeds two, the LOE grows linearly in time. We prove this in the limit of large dimensions and present numerical evidence that a three-dimensional local configuration space is sufficient for a linear growth of LOE. Our findings highlight that quantum chaos can be produced by essentially classical dynamics. Moreover, we show that LOE can be defined also in the classical realm and put it forward as a universal indicator chaos, both quantum and classical.",

Our results show that fully optimized SHCI achieves near-universal solvability on the benchmark set, DMRG excels for low-entanglement systems, and DF QPE is currently constrained by hardware and algorithmic limitations.

We analyze the role of gauge transformations for the case of a U(1)-symmetric PEPS with point group symmetry, thereby reducing the gauge degrees of freedom to a single class. We show how gradient-based optimization strategies exploit the gauge freedom, causing the tensor network contraction to become increasingly inaccurate and to produce artificially low variational energies. Furthermore, we develop a gauge-fixed optimization strategy that largely suppresses this effect, resulting in a more robust optimization.

Tensor network approaches, in particular matrix product states (MPS) combined with the time-evolving block decimation (TEBD) algorithm, currently dominate large-scale circuit simulations. These methods scale efficiently when entanglement is limited but suffer rapid bond dimension growth with increasing entanglement and handle long-range gates via costly SWAP insertions. Motivated by the success of the time-dependent variational principle (TDVP) in many-body physics, we reinterpret quantum circuits as a series of discrete time evolutions, using gate generators to construct an MPS-based circuit simulation via a local TDVP formulation. This addresses TEBD's key limitations by (1) naturally accommodating long-range gates and (2) optimally representing states on the MPS manifold. By diffusing entanglement more globally, the method suppresses local bond growth and reduces memory and runtime costs. We benchmark the approach on five 49-qubit circuits: three Hamiltonian circuits (1D open and periodic Heisenberg, 2D 7x7 Ising) and two algorithmic ones (quantum approximate optimization, hardware-efficient ansatz). Across all cases, our method yields substantial resource reductions over standard tools, establishing a new state-of-the-art for circuit simulation and enabling advances across quantum computing, condensed matter, and beyond.",

      "abstract": "We study the dynamics on the flat-band (FB) and all-bands-flat (AFB) lattices using a digital quantum computer. By utilizing an advanced tensor network method to compress the quantum circuit, we overcome the intrinsic limitations of current noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computers. This enables high-fidelity simulations of time evolution over extended timescales and various interesting dynamical behaviours are observed in our digital quantum simulation. We start from the quantum simulation of the single-particle quantum walk on the FB and AFB lattices, which are realized by tuning the magnetic flux per plaquette to $\\phi=0$ and $\\phi=\\pi$ respectively. With compressed quantum circuit, we are able to simulate the delocalization in FB lattice and the Aharonov-Bohm caging in AFB lattice. Next, we integrate FB and ABF lattices within a one-dimensional lattice structure and study how these lattices can be utilized to control quantum transport. Moreover, we investigate the effectiveness of a single ABF lattice in controlling the two particles dynamics without and with interaction. We find that the hopping amplitude remains an effective and tunable parameter for controlling particle transport even in the presence of interactions. Our results show that digital quantum simulations of flat-band physics are feasible on current digital NISQ devices through circuit compression. Moreover, this capability enables us to study the potential applications of flat-band systems in quantum control and emerging quantum technologies.",

We use an analytic approach to show that the fully spin-polarized state becomes unstable to a metastable spin-polaron when the kinetic frustration $t'/t$ exceeds a critical, dimension-dependent value. Large-scale density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations reveal a quantum phase transition from the NT ferromagnet to a spiral spin-density wave, which evolves continuously into the Haerter-Shastry antiferromagnet in the large-frustration limit. Remarkably, this transition remains robust at low but finite hole density, making it accessible in cold-atom and moir\\'e Hubbard platforms under strong interactions. A variational analysis further captures the instability mechanism at finite density via frustration-induced magnon band deformation.",

We confirm the existence of a continuous (2 + 1)D XY* transition between the TC and DS phases by mapping it to a two-coupled quantum Ising model. Importantly, using the condensation order parameters and the area law coefficients of the Wilson loops, we further reveal that $\\mathbb{Z}_4$ anyons, fractionalized from the $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological orders, become deconfined at the transition between $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ topologically ordered phases.

In this paper, we show that a large class of MPUs can be implemented with a polynomial-depth quantum circuit. For an $N$-site MPU built from a repeated bulk tensor with open boundary, we explicitly construct a quantum circuit of polynomial depth $T = O(N^{\\alpha})$ realizing the MPU, where the constant $\\alpha$ depends only on the bulk and boundary tensor and not the system size $N$. We show that this class includes nontrivial unitaries that generate long-range entanglement and, in particular, contains a large class of unitaries constructed from representations of $C^*$-weak Hopf algebras.

A technique is introduced to obscure the final bitstring in the structure of the quantum circuit. The algorithm allows precise control over the probability of the final peaked state.

Monte Carlo methods require thousands to billions of samples, incurring high computational costs and producing inconsistent results due to stochasticity. We present an efficient tensor train method for performing exact arithmetic operations on discretizations of continuous probability distributions while avoiding exponential growth. Our approach leverages low-rank tensor train decomposition to represent latent random variables compactly using Dirac deltas, enabling deterministic addition, subtraction and multiplication operations directly in the compressed format. We develop an efficient implementation using sparse matrices and specialized data structures that further enhances performance. Theoretical analysis demonstrates polynomial scaling of memory and computational complexity under rank assumptions, and shows how statistics of latent variables can be computed with polynomial complexity. Numerical experiments spanning randomized linear algebra to stochastic differential equations demonstrate orders-of-magnitude improvements in memory usage and computational time compared to conventional approaches, enabling tractable deterministic computations on discretized random variables in previously intractable dimensions.",

Here, we propose tensor network variational diagonalization (TNVD), which encodes the full eigenenergy spectrum of a quantum many-body Hamiltonian into a matrix product state, and encodes the eigenstates as the evolutions of product states using variational quantum circuit (VQC). Thereby, TNVD reduces the computational complexity of diagonalization from exponential to polynomial in system size $N$. Numerical benchmarks up to $N=100$ spins are provided, which far surpass the computational limit of ED. We further consider quantum Ising model in a random field to reveal the underlying reliance between the efficiency of TNVD and entanglement properties of eigenstates. Typical signs, including the distribution of entanglement entropy (EE) versus eigenenergy and the density of state versus EE, are suggested to indicate area law of entanglement entropy or its violation, which are essential to the TNVD efficiency. Our work establishes TNVD as a powerful and scalable diagonalization approach for large-scale quantum many-body Hamiltonians. The incorporation of VQC lays a promising pathway to applying quantum computation to address the volume-law-EE Hamiltonians that lack efficient classical approaches.",

Our algorithm represents the state of a noisy quantum system by a particular ensemble of matrix product states from which we stochastically sample.

This approach lets us use a more compact representation of the quantum state for a given accuracy requirement and noise level. For a given maximum bond dimension $\\chi$ and circuit, our algorithm comes with an upper bound on the simulation error, runs in poly$(n,\\chi)$-time and improves upon related prior work (1) in scope: by extending from the three commonly considered noise models to general single qubit noise (2) in performance: by employing a state-dependent locally-entanglement-optimal unraveling and (3) in conceptual contribution: by showing that the fixed unraveling used in prior work becomes equivalent to our choice of unraveling in the special case of depolarizing and dephasing noise acting on a maximally entangled state.",

      "abstract": "Thermalisation and information scrambling in out-of-equilibrium quantum many-body systems are deeply intertwined: local subsystems dynamically approach thermal density matrices while their entropies track information spreading. Projected ensembles--ensembles of pure states conditioned on measurement outcomes of complementary subsystems--provide higher-order probes of thermalisation, converging at late times to universal maximum-entropy ensembles. In this work, we introduce the partial projected ensemble (PPE) as a framework to study how the spatiotemporal structure of scrambling is imprinted on projected ensembles. The PPE consists of an ensemble of mixed states induced on a subsystem by measurements on a spatially separated part of its complement, tracing out the remainder, naturally capturing scenarios involving discarded outcomes or noise-induced losses. We show that statistical fluctuations of the PPE faithfully track the causal lightcone of information spreading, revealing how scrambling dynamics are encoded in ensemble structure. In addition, we demonstrate that the probabilities of bit-string probabilities (PoPs) associated with the PPE exhibit distinct dynamical regimes and provide an experimentally accessible probe of scrambling. Both PPE fluctuations and PoPs display exponential sensitivity to the size of the discarded region, reflecting exponential degradation of quantum correlations under erasure. We substantiate these findings using the non-integrable kicked Ising chain, combining numerics in the ergodic regime with exact results at its self-dual point. We extend our analysis to a many-body localised (MBL) regime numerically, along with analytic results for the $\\ell$-bit model. The linear and logarithmic lightcones characteristic of ergodic and MBL regimes emerge naturally from PPE dynamics, establishing it as a powerful tool for probing scrambling and deep thermalisation.",

We additionally perform a detailed comparison of the entanglement spectrum with predictions from the Li-Haldane conjecture, finding remarkable agreement, and enabling a more precise understanding of the effects of the distinct neutral and charged velocities. This not only provides a stringent test of the conjecture but also highlights its explanatory power in understanding the origin and structure of finite-size effects across different symmetry sectors.",

      "abstract": "Higher-spin quantum magnets with competing interactions offer a rich platform for exploring quantum phases that transcend the paradigms of spin-1/2 systems, owing to their enlarged local Hilbert spaces and the emergence of multipolar correlations. We investigate a one-dimensional spin-1 chain where quadrupolar order is promoted by two distinct mechanisms: conventional bilinear-biquadratic exchange and bond-directional antiferromagnetic Kitaev frustration. Using density matrix renormalization group calculations, we determine the complete ground-state phase diagram and uncover two emergent phases induced by the Kitaev interaction: a Kitaev nematic phase and a Kitaev-dimer phase. The Kitaev nematic phase emerges from a fragile biquadratic dimer state via a continuous quantum phase transition in the Ising universality class. The Kitaev dimer phase spontaneously breaks a screw symmetry to favor either $x$- or $y$-spin bonding, forming a gapped state that coexists with a crystalline order of alternating $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ fluxes.",

While hyperparameter selection remains a challenge, requiring careful optimisation to unlock the full potential of these models, this work contributes significantly to the development of QML for solving intricate problems in aeroelasticity. We present an end-to-end trainable hybrid algorithm. We first encode time series into tensor networks to then utilise trainable tensor networks for dimensionality reduction, and convert the resulting tensor to a quantum circuit in the encoding step. Then, a tensor network inspired trainable variational quantum circuit is applied to solve either a classification or a multivariate or univariate regression task in the aeroelasticity domain.",

Conventional observables do not exhibit growing length scales upon quenching into the high-temperature phase; however, the Markov length grows exponentially in time. Consequently, the state of a system as it heats becomes increasingly non-Gibbsian, and the range of its putative \"parent Hamiltonian\" must diverge with the Markov length. From this information-theoretic point of view the late-time limit of thermalization is singular. We introduce a numerical technique for computing the Markov length based on matrix-product states, and explore its dynamics under general thermal quenches in the one-dimensional classical Ising model. For all cases, we provide simple information-theoretic arguments that explain our results.",

When the hopping integral and the on-site potential of the fermions depend on the direction of the link spins, the low-energy effective theory predicts that the link spins behave as a dynamical axion field in 1+1 dimensions. The axion field $\\theta$ is coupled to the electric field $E$ as $\\theta E$, through which the link spins rotate in response to the applied electric field or the chemical potential gradient for charge-neutral fermions. This is the inverse phenomenon of Thouless pumping in the Rice-Mele model. After analyzing the dynamics by approximating the link spins with the classical ones and utilizing the axion Lagrangian, we show the full-quantum dynamics using the tensor network method. Even though we do not explicitly introduce the axion Lagrangian in solving the fermion-spin coupled many-body dynamics, the full-quantum results agree well with those with the classical spin approximation, including the dynamics of the axion field and fermion transport. In addition, we find that the quantum correlation between spins accelerates the dynamics of axion fields as the suppression of the expectation values of the link spins allows them to rotate easily. We also propose a possible experimental setup for cold-atomic systems to implement the Hamiltonian in this study.",

Our approach respects the biorthogonal structure of left and right eigenstates, and is further strengthened by exploiting system symmetries and pseudo-Hermiticity. Tested on a two-dimensional non-Hermitian transverse field Ising model endowed with a complex longitudinal field, our method achieves high accuracy across both parity-time symmetric and broken phases. Moreover, we propose novel optimization routines that address the challenges posed by exceptional points and provide reliable convergence to the ground state in regimes where standard variational techniques fail.

In one research direction, out-of-time-ordered correlators (OTOCs) have recently been shown to probe freeness between Heisenberg operators, the non-commutative generalization of statistical independence. In a distinct setting, approximate unitary designs look random according to small moments and for forward-in-time protocols. Bridging these two concepts, we study the emergence of freeness in a random matrix product unitary (RMPU) ensemble, an efficient unitary design. We prove that, with only polynomial bond dimension, these unitaries reproduce Haar values of higher-order OTOCs for local, finite-trace observables -- precisely those predicted to thermalize in chaotic many-body systems according to the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis. We further compute the frame potential of the RMPU ensemble, showing convergence to the Haar value also with only polynomial deviations, indicating that freeness is reached on-average for global observables. On the other hand, to reproduce freeness for traceless observables, volume-law operator entanglement is required. Our results highlight the need to refine previous notions of unitary design in the context of operator dynamics, guiding us towards protocols for quantum advantage while shedding light on the emergent complexity of chaotic many-body systems.",

      "abstract": "Schmidt decomposition of a vector can be understood as writing the singular value decomposition (SVD) in vector form. A vector can be written as a linear combination of tensor product of two dimensional vectors by recursively applying Schmidt decompositions via SVD to all subsystems. Given a vector expressed as a linear combination of tensor products, using only the $k$ principal terms yields a $k$-rank approximation of the vector. Therefore, writing a vector in this reduced form allows to retain most important parts of the vector while removing small noises from it, analogous to SVD-based denoising. In this paper, we show that quantum circuits designed based on a value $k$ (determined from the tensor network decomposition of the mean vector of the training sample) can approximate the reduced-form representations of entire datasets. We then employ this circuit ansatz with a classical neural network head to construct a hybrid machine learning model. Since the output of the quantum circuit for an $2^n$ dimensional vector is an $n$ dimensional probability vector, this provides an exponential compression of the input and potentially can reduce the number of learnable parameters for training large-scale models. We use datasets provided in the Python scikit-learn module for the experiments. The results confirm the quantum circuit is able to compress data successfully to provide effective $k$-rank approximations to the classical processing component.",

We investigate the phenomenon of grokking, where generalization emerges suddenly after memorization, by tracking entanglement entropy, local magnetization, and model performance across training sweeps. Additionally, we employ information theory tools to gain deeper insights: transfer entropy is used to reveal causal dependencies between label-specific quantum masks, while O-information captures the shift from synergistic to redundant correlations among class outputs. Our results show that grokking in the fashion MNIST task coincides with a sharp entanglement transition and a peak in redundant information, whereas the overfitted hyper-spectral model retains synergistic, disordered behavior.

However, in the context of field digitization (FD) -- a truncation of the local fields to $N$ discrete values -- a comprehensive framework to obtain continuum results is currently missing. Here, we propose to analyze FD by interpreting the parameter $N$ as a coupling in the renormalization group (RG) sense. As a first example, we investigate the two-dimensional classical $N$-state clock model as a $\\mathbb{Z}_N$ FD of the $U(1)$-symmetric $XY$-model. Using effective field theory, we employ the RG to derive generalized scaling hypotheses involving the FD parameter $N$, which allows us to relate data obtained for different $N$-regularized models in a procedure that we term $\\textit{field digitization scaling}$ (FDS). Using numerical tensor-network calculations at finite bond dimension $\\chi$, we further uncover an unconventional universal crossover around a low-temperature phase transition induced by finite $N$, demonstrating that FDS can be extended to describe the interplay of $\\chi$ and $N$. Finally, we analytically prove that our calculations for the 2D classical-statistical $\\mathbb{Z}_N$ clock model are directly related to the quantum physics in the ground state of a (2+1)D $\\mathbb{Z}_N$ lattice gauge theory which serves as a FD of compact quantum electrodynamics. Our study thus paves the way for applications of FDS to quantum simulations of more complex models in higher spatial dimensions, where it could serve as a tool to analyze the continuum limit of digitized quantum field theories.",

This represents a major challenge in achieving quantum advantage. We present and analyze a novel two-step state preparation method where we first minimize the entanglement entropy of the target quantum state, thus transforming the state to one that is easier to prepare. The state with reduced entanglement entropy is then represented as a matrix product state, resulting in a high accuracy preparation of the target state.

In this paper, we ask how to obtain the full, potentially non-invertible symmetry action from the unitary sequential circuit and how the connection to sequential circuit constrains the properties of the generalized symmetries. We find that for symmetries that contain the trivial symmetry operator as a fusion outcome, which we call annihilable symmetries, the sequential circuit fully determines the symmetry action and puts various constraints on their fusion. In contrast, for unannihilable symmetries, like that whose corresponding twist is the Cheshire string, a further 1D sequential circuit is needed for the full description.

To study this topic, we consider the particular case of Fibonacci anyons subject to an anyonic tight-binding model with nearest-neighbor repulsion on a two-leg ladder. Focusing on the case of half-filling, for low interaction strengths an ''anyonic'' metal is found, whereas for strong repulsion, the anyons form an insulating charge-density wave. Within the latter regime, we introduce an effective one-dimensional model up to sixth order in perturbation theory arising from anyonic superexchange processes. We numerically identify four distinct phases of the effective model, which we characterize using matrix product state methods.

In particular, the compression is done through a two-stage approach. In the first stage, we use existing subroutines to encode the distribution function in a tensor train format. In the second stage, we use an NTT ansatz to fit the obtained tensor train. For the NTT fitting procedure, we use a log barrier term to ensure the positivity of each tensor component, and then utilize a second-order alternating minimization scheme to accelerate convergence. In practice, we observe that the proposed NTT fitting procedure exhibits drastically faster convergence than an alternative multiplicative update method that has been previously proposed.

A rich ground state phase diagram is obtained in the parameter space spanned by the ratio of inter- to intra-dimer interaction (which measures the degree of frustration) and an external magnetic field. Some ground state phases exhibit effective Haldane chain character, whereas others exhibit fragmentation of the ground state wavefunction, or clustering. The phases are characterized by their static properties, including (local) spin quantum number, entanglement entropy, and the spin-spin correlation function. Detailed characterization of a carefully selected set of representative states is presented.

When performing the Kramers-Wannier duality the fact that it alters boundary conditions becomes crucial, since a finite fraction of lattice sites lie on the boundary. We propose to characterize this ``intermediate'' phase by its sensitivity to boundary conditions, wherein bulk ordering is not spontaneous but rather induced by boundary effects, setting it apart from the Landau paradigm of spontaneous symmetry breaking. By developing a $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry restricted extension of the Corner Transfer Matrix Renormalization Group method, we provide numerical evidence for the existence of all three distinct phases and their corresponding two-stage phase transitions, thereby establishing the complete phase diagram. We also establish how the (spontaneous) intermediate-to-ferromagnetic and the (induced) paramagnetic-to-intermediate transition points are related by the Kramers-Wannier duality relation. We discuss a holographic correspondence between boundary and bulk behaviors and derive exact expressions for boundary correlation functions on Cayley trees.",

      "abstract": "Understanding how molecules arrange on surfaces is fundamental to surface chemistry and essential for the rational design of catalytic and functional materials. In particular, the energetically most stable configuration provides valuable insight into adsorption-related processes. However, the search for this configuration is a global optimization problem with exponentially growing complexity as the number of adsorbates and possible adsorption sites increases. To address this, we express the adsorption energy as a sum of multi-adsorbate interaction terms, evaluated using our in-house trained machine learning interatomic potential MACE-Osaka24, and formulate the search for the most stable configuration as a higher-order unconstrained binary optimization (HUBO) problem. We employ a tensor-train-based method, Tensor Train Optimizer (TTOpt), to solve the HUBO problem and identify optimal adsorption configurations of CO and NO molecules on various alloys up to full surface coverage. Our results show that including interaction terms up to third order may be sufficient to approximate adsorption energies within chemical accuracy and to identify optimal configurations. We also observed that TTOpt performs better with the HUBO formulation, suggesting that third-order terms help preserve correlations between adsorption sites, which allow TTOpt to optimize configurations more effectively. The extensive benchmarks across various alloys, surface geometries, and adsorbates demonstrate the robustness and applicability of using TTOpt to solve HUBO-type global optimization problems in surface chemistry. In contrast to quantum and digital annealers, which have recently been applied to similar global optimization tasks but are restricted to cost functions with at most quadratic terms, our approach can incorporate higher-order terms in a straightforward manner and does not require specialized hardware.",

Efficiently distributing the contraction task across multiple nodes is critical, as both computational and memory costs are highly sensitive to the chosen partitioning strategy. While prior work has employed general-purpose hypergraph partitioning algorithms, these approaches often overlook the specific structure and cost characteristics of tensor network contractions. We introduce a simulated annealing-based method that iteratively refines the partitioning to minimize the total operation count, thereby reducing time-to-solution.

Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods suffer from slow mixing and require manual tuning, while autoregressive NQS impose restrictive architectural constraints that complicate the enforcement of symmetries and the construction of determinant-based multi-state wave functions. In this work, we introduce Neural Importance Resampling (NIR), a new sampling algorithm that combines importance resampling with a separately trained autoregressive proposal network. This approach enables efficient and unbiased sampling without constraining the NQS architecture. We demonstrate that NIR supports stable and scalable training, including for multi-state NQS, and mitigates issues faced by MCMC and autoregressive approaches. Numerical experiments on the 2D transverse-field Ising model show that NIR outperforms MCMC in challenging regimes and yields results competitive with density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) methods.

Utilizing numerical methods such as exact diagonalization and density renormalization group theory, the ground state properties of this setup are investigated to understand the Josephson effect in a strongly correlated regime. The dynamical properties of this model for different configurations of this model are analyzed to find the configurations that can produce the Josephson effect.

      "abstract": "Localized orbital-based quantum embedding, as originally formulated in the context of density matrix embedding theory (DMET), is revisited from the perspective of lattice density functional theory (DFT). An in-principle exact (in the sense of full configuration interaction) formulation of the theory, where the occupations of the localized orbitals play the role of the density, is derived for any (model or ab initio) electronic Hamiltonian. From this general formalism we deduce an exact relation between the local Hartree-exchange-correlation (Hxc) potential of the full-size Kohn-Sham (KS) lattice-like system and the embedding chemical potential that is adjusted on each embedded fragment, individually, such that both KS and embedding cluster systems reproduce the exact same local density. When well-identified density-functional approximations (that find their justification in the strongly correlated regime) are applied, a practical self-consistent local potential functional embedding theory (LPFET), where the local Hxc potential becomes the basic variable, naturally emerges from the theory. LPFET differs from previous density embedding approaches by its fragment-dependent embedding chemical potential expression, which is a simple functional of the Hxc potential. Numerical calculations on prototypical systems show the ability of such an ansatz to ease convergence and improve substantially the description of density profiles (localized orbital occupations in this context) in strongly correlated systems.",

While the evolution into magnonic bound states has been well characterized, experimental insight into the analogous transition to triplons remains limited. Here, using high-resolution neutron spectroscopy and state-of-the-art spin dynamics simulations, we uncover the transformation from weakly interacting spinons to tightly bound triplons in the spin-Peierls compound CuGeO3. Quantitative comparisons between the measured spectra and tensor network simulations reveal substantial next-nearest-neighbor frustration and weak external dimerization, placing the system deep within the spontaneously dimerized regime and near the exactly solvable Majumdar-Ghosh point. We further show an energy- and temperature-dependent evolution between two contrasting quasiparticle regimes: deconfined spinons with markedly suppressed interactions by frustration, and coherent triplonic bound states with no observable spinon degrees of freedom. Remarkably, triplon character persists into the two-particle regime, forming a structured two-triplon continuum with a spectral feature associated with a van Hove singularity at its lower boundary. These findings challenge the conventional view that robust triplons require strong external dimerization and demonstrate how the interplay between frustration and dimerization can reshape fractionalization and confinement.",

Additionally, experiments showing string breaking are performed on IBM's quantum platform.

At the same time, it is not clear how to efficiently simulate the LGT using classical methods. Furthermore, strategies that avoid barren plateaus arise naturally as features of LGTs, such as choosing the initialization by setting the Gauss law sector and restricting the Hilbert space to the gauge-invariant subspace.",

In doing so, we precisely match the QTT bond dimension, a measure of length scale entanglement, to the number of rescaled couplings generated in each coarse-graining renormalization step. While QTTs have so far been applied almost exclusively to numerical problems in physics, our analytical calculations demonstrate that they are also powerful tools for mitigating computational costs in semi-analytical treatments.

Here, we focus on assessing several sources of numerical instabilities that can appear in the simulation of quantum dynamics based on the time-dependent variational principle (TDVP) with the computationally efficient explicit time integration scheme. Using the restricted Boltzmann machine architecture, we compare solutions obtained by TDVP with analytical solutions and implicit methods as a function of the quench strength. Interestingly, we uncover a quenching strength that leads to a numerical breakdown in the absence of Monte Carlo noise, despite the fact that physical observables don't exhibit irregularities. This breakdown phenomenon appears consistently across several different TDVP formulations, even those that eliminate small eigenvalues of the Fisher matrix or use geometric properties to recast the equation of motion. We conclude that alternative methods need to be developed to leverage the computational efficiency of explicit time integration of the TDVP equations for simulating strongly nonequilibrium quantum dynamics with neural-network quantum states.",

      "abstract": "Quantum state preparation (QSP) is a fundamental task in quantum computing and quantum information processing. It is critical to the execution of many quantum algorithms, including those in quantum machine learning. In this paper, we propose a family of efficient QSP algorithms tailored to different numbers of available ancilla qubits - ranging from no ancilla qubits, to a single ancilla qubit, to a sufficiently large number of ancilla qubits. Our approach exploits the power of Local Invertible Map Tensor Decision Diagrams (LimTDDs) - a highly compact representation of quantum states that combines tensor networks and decision diagrams to reduce quantum circuit complexity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our methods significantly outperform existing approaches and exhibit better scalability for large-scale quantum states, both in terms of runtime and gate complexity. Furthermore, our method shows exponential improvement in best-case scenarios.",

      "abstract": "We investigate the thermal Hall conductivity in the Kitaev model with additional interactions under a magnetic field, employing a finite-temperature tensor network method benchmarked by a thermal pure quantum state technique. We find that the thermal Hall conductivity divided by temperature, $\\kappa_{xy}/T$, significantly overshoots the value of the half-integer quantization and exhibits a pronounced hump while decreasing temperature. Moreover, we show that the field-direction dependence of $\\kappa_{xy}/T$ is consistent with the sign of the Chern number associated with the Majorana fermions across a wide range of magnetic fields. We also demonstrate that the additional off-diagonal interactions, known as the $\\Gamma$ and $\\Gamma^{\\prime}$ terms, considerably affect $\\kappa_{xy}/T$. In particular, we show that positive $\\Gamma$ and negative $\\Gamma^{\\prime}$ lead to a remarkable enhancement in the intermediate temperature region. From the comparison with the classical counterpart, we reveal that the effects of the $\\Gamma$ term go beyond the classical picture, indicating significant quantum fluctuation effects, while those of the $\\Gamma^\\prime$ term are well captured at the classical level. These comprehensive analyses indicate that the enhanced thermal Hall response is consistently explained by dominant contributions from topological Majorana fermions, even within the polarized regime beyond the critical field. Our approach not only establishes a robust theoretical framework for understanding the thermal Hall transport in Kitaev materials such as $\\alpha$-RuCl$_{3}$, but also offers a promising pathway to bridge the gap between theories and experiments across a wide range of strongly correlated materials.",

      "abstract": "The motion of dopants in magnetic spin lattices has received tremendous attention for at least four decades due to its connection to high-temperature superconductivity. Despite these efforts, we lack a complete understanding of their behavior, especially out-of-equilibrium and at nonzero temperatures. In this Article, we take a significant step towards a much deeper understanding based on state-of-the-art matrix-product-state calculations. In particular, we investigate the non-equilibrium dynamics of a dopant in two-leg $t$-$J$ ladders with antiferromagnetic XXZ spin interactions. In the Ising limit, we find that the dopant is localized for all investigated nonzero temperatures due to an emergent disordered potential, with a localization length controlled by the underlying correlation length of the spin lattice, whereby it only delocalizes asymptotically in the zero temperature limit. This greatly generalizes the localization effect discovered recently in Hilbert space fragmented models. In the presence of spin-exchange processes, the dopant delocalizes according to a power-law behavior, which is strongly sub-diffusive for weak spin-exchange but which eventually becomes diffusive for strong enough exchange. Moreover, we show that the underlying spin dynamics at infinite temperature behaves qualitatively the same, albeit with important quantitative differences. We substantiate these findings by showing that the dynamics shows self-similar scaling behavior, which strongly deviates from the Gaussian behavior of regular diffusion. Finally, we show that the diffusion coefficient follows an Arrhenius relation at high temperatures, whereby it exponentially decreases for decreasing temperatures.",

However, even in the simplest model of spinless fermions on a two-dimensional checkerboard lattice, the quantum phase diagram as a function of nearest-neighbor interaction remains under debate. We employ constrained-path quantum Monte Carlo simulations (CP-QMC) simulations to investigate the problem using a two-dimensional torus geometry. We cross-validate our results on small lattices by comparing them with density-matrix renormalization group calculations, finding quantitative agreement. In particular, we implement an improved optimization scheme within the CP-QMC simulations, enabling the identification of a bond-nematic Dirac semimetal phase that was found in tensor-network studies on cylindrical geometries, but remains inaccessible to Hartree-Fock mean-field methods. The CP-QMC approach makes it possible to establish the emergence of this phase in a geometry that preserves lattice rotational symmetry and permits extrapolation to the thermodynamic limit. Our results show that the quantum phase diagram of spinless fermions on the checkerboard lattice with nearest-neighbor repulsion features three interaction-induced phases at half filling: a quantum anomalous Hall insulator at weak coupling, a bond-nematic Dirac semimetal at intermediate coupling, and a site-nematic insulator at strong coupling.",

The dual field theory of such system corresponds to a defected version of $N = 4$ super Yang-Mills theory, where the one-point functions of certain scalars are non-zero. The calculation of one-point functions is mapped to the overlap between matrix product states and Bethe states. The matrix product states are found to be solutions of the twisted Boundary Yang-Baxter equation, and equivalently the representations of extended twisted Yangian. By dressing procedure or coproduct property, we can connect the scalar matrix product state and higher dimension matrix product states.

The resulting Multipartite Markov gap can capture geometric obstructions to bulk reconstruction. We investigate the properties of this quantity from both information-theoretic and holographic viewpoints, and examine its potential operational significance through candidate recovery maps.

Crucially, their ground-state energies can be computed exactly, provided the construction parameters are known. To obscure this structure and control perceived complexity, we introduce techniques such as killer operators, balance operators, and random orbital rotations. We showcase this framework using examples based on homogeneous catalysts of industrial relevance and validate tunable difficulty through density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) convergence behavior.

Although the variational principle breaks down in this case, we demonstrate that tensor network algorithms are still capable of simulating these non-Hermitian theories. We access system sizes up to $L = 28$, which enable the observation of the theoretically predicted spiral flow of the running couplings.

The proper way to understand tensor networks themselves is through explicit examples of solvable ground states that they describe exactly. In fact, this has historically been how tensor networks for gapped ground states, such as the matrix product state (MPS) and the projected entangled paired state, emerged as an elegant analytical framework from numerical techniques like the density matrix renormalization group. However, for gapless ground states, generically described by the multiscale entanglement renormalization ansatz (MERA), a corresponding exactly solvable model has so far been missing. This is because the hierarchical structure of MERA intrinsically breaks the translational invariance. We identify a condition for MERA to be compatible with translational invariance by examining equivalent networks of rank-3 tensors. The condition is satisfied by the previously constructed hierarchical tensor network for the Motzkin and Fredkin chains, which can be considered a non-unitary generalization to the MERA. The hierarchical TN description is complemented by a translationally invariant MPS alternative, which is used to derive the power-law decay of the correlation function and critical exponents.",

Our witnesses can be efficiently measured using SWAP tests or variants of Bell measurements, thus making them directly implementable on current hardware. Leveraging our witnesses, we present several novel results on entanglement properties of mixed states, both in quantum information and many-body physics. We develop efficient algorithms to test whether mixed states with bounded entropy have low or high entanglement, which previously was only possible for pure states. We also provide an efficient algorithm to test the Schmidt rank using only two-copy measurements, and to test the operator Schmidt rank using four-copy measurements. Further, our witnesses enable robust certification of quantum circuit depth even in the presence of noise, a task which so far has been limited to noiseless circuits only. Finally, we show that the entanglement phase diagram of Haar random states, quantified by the partial transpose negativity, can be fully established solely by computing our witness, a result that also applies to any state 4-design. Our witnesses can also be efficiently computed for matrix product states, thus enabling the characterization of entanglement in extensive many-body systems. Finally, we make progress on the entanglement required for quantum cryptography, establishing rigorous limits on pseudoentanglement and pseudorandom density matrices with bounded entropy. Our work opens new avenues for quantifying entanglement in large and noisy quantum systems.",

The protocol takes as an input classical shadows corresponding to local randomized measurements, and outputs the tensors of a MPO which maximizes a suitably-defined fidelity with the experimental state. The tensor optimization is carried out sequentially, similarly to the well-known density matrix renormalization group algorithm. Our approach is provably efficient under certain technical conditions which are expected to be met in short-range correlated states and in typical noisy experimental settings. Under the same conditions, we also provide an efficient scheme to estimate fidelities between the learned and the experimental states.

This allows us to compute the mutual robustness of magic for partitions up to 8 sites, embedded into a much larger system. We show how mutual robustness is directly related to critical behaviors: at the critical point, it displays a power law decay as a function of the distance between partitions, whose exponent is related to the partition size. Once finite temperature is included, mutual magic retains its low temperature value up to an effective critical temperature, whose dependence on size is also algebraic. This suggests that magic, differently from entanglement, does not necessarily undergo a sudden death.",

On the one hand, our boundary conformal field theory (BCFT) formulation of higher Berry phase provides a new analytic tool to study families of invertible phases in condensed matter systems. On the other hand, it uncovers a new geometric structure on the moduli space of conformal boundary conditions, beyond the usual Riemannian structure defined through the Zamolodchikov metric. When the boundary conformal manifold has an interpretation as the position moduli space of a D-brane, our higher Berry connection coincides with the NS-NS $B$-field in string theory. The general definition does not require such an interpretation and is formulated purely field-theoretically, in terms of correlation functions of boundary-condition-changing (bcc) operators.

However, a major limitation of it is that its computational cost grows exponentially with the number of impurity flavors. In this work, we propose a multi-flavor extension of it to overcome this limitation. The key insight is that to calculate multi-time correlation functions on one or a few impurity flavors, one could integrate out the degrees of freedom of the rest flavors before hand, which could greatly simplify the calculation. The idea is particularly effective for quantum impurity problems with diagonal hybridization function, i.e., each impurity flavor is coupled to an independent bath, a setting which is commonly used in the field. We demonstrate the accuracy and scalability of our method for the imaginary time evolution of impurity problems with up to three impurity orbitals, i.e., 6 flavors, and benchmark our results against continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo calculations. Our method paves the way of scaling up tensor network algorithms to solve large-scale quantum impurity problems.",

Here, we establish that a broad class of SU and MF circuits are dual to each other under a spacetime rotation. We investigate this spacetime duality in the preparation of various long-range entangled states, including GHZ states, topologically ordered states, and fractal symmetry-breaking states. As an illustration, applying a spacetime rotation to a linear-depth SU circuit that implements a non-invertible Kramers-Wannier duality, originally used to prepare a 1D GHZ state, yields a constant-depth MF circuit that implements a $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry gauging map, which equivalently prepares the GHZ state. Leveraging this duality, we further propose experimental protocols that require only a constant number of qubits to measure unconventional properties of 1D many-body states. These include (i) measurement of disorder operators, which diagnose the absence of spontaneous symmetry breaking, and (ii) postselection-free detection of measurement-induced long-range order, which emerges in certain symmetry-protected topological phases.

This paper introduces a novel QAS framework employing hybrid quantum reinforcement learning with quantum curriculum learning strategies, enabling learning agents to tackle increasingly complex quantum circuit design tasks. We benchmark four state-of-the-art classical reinforcement learning algorithms (A2C, PPO, DDQN, TD3) against their quantum-enhanced counterparts (QA2C, QPPO, QDDQN, QTD3) for optimizing variational quantum circuits (VQCs). Our approach progressively increases circuit depth and gate complexity during training, leveraging parameterized quantum circuits as function approximations. To improve learning efficiency and stability, all algorithms, both classical and quantum, are augmented with Prioritized Experience Replay (PER). Experimental results show that quantum-enhanced RL significantly outperforms classical methods. In a 2-qubit environment, PERQDDQN achieves a success probability of 0.46 with ~3,000 optimal successes, surpassing classical PERDDQN (0.42, ~2,400). In the more complex 3-qubit setting, PERQDDQN and PERQTD3 reach success probabilities of ~0.47, with optimal success counts of ~3,800 and ~3,600, respectively, outperforming their classical counterparts. Additionally, we apply our QAS-QTN approach to a classification problem, where the optimized quantum circuit achieves an accuracy of 90.33\\%, outperforming quantum models consisting of random ansatz. This hybrid classical-quantum approach leads to faster convergence and more efficient quantum circuit designs, demonstrating its potential for advancing automated quantum architecture search.",

We propose Bayesian Tensor Network Kernel Machines, a fully probabilistic framework that uses sparsity-inducing hierarchical priors on TN factors to automatically infer model complexity. This enables automatic inference of tensor rank and feature dimensions, while also identifying the most relevant features for prediction, thereby enhancing model interpretability. All the model parameters and hyperparameters are treated as latent variables with corresponding priors. Given the Bayesian approach and latent variable dependencies, we apply a mean-field variational inference to approximate their posteriors. We show that applying a mean-field approximation to TN factors yields a Bayesian ALS algorithm with the same computational complexity as its deterministic counterpart, enabling uncertainty quantification at no extra computational cost.

We verify the validity of the approach by studying the phase diagram of the Hubbard dimer, the four-site Hubbard ring with and without next-nearest neighbor hopping and the single-impurity Anderson model. We find time scale entanglement to be a system-inherent property becoming maximal at phase transitions and crossover, which translates to peaks in the quantics tensor train bond dimension of correlator functions.

The BPSP can be conveniently formulated as an Ising ground state problem with a symmetric Hamiltonian and Ising graph structure that is well-suited for QAOA parameter-transfer techniques. Throughout our quantum simulated experiments, parameter transfer showed no noticeable reduction in solution quality over optimisation for QAOA and RQAOA while substantially improving the efficiency due to avoiding measurements required for optimisation. Additionally, RQAOA only requires measurements of $ZZ$-correlations instead of full statevectors, benefiting from the reverse-causal-cone feature that leads to circuits with significantly lower CNOT counts and depths. The performance of QAOA and RQAOA with parameter transfer is benchmarked against classical solvers and heuristics and their resilience to non-optimal parameters is explored. The entanglement entropy and bond dimensions are obtained from matrix product state simulations to provide an indication of the classical resources required to simulate the quantum algorithms.

We relate these objects to measures of non-Gaussianity of operators associated to the occupations of the natural super-orbitals, and define how the non-stabilizerness of operators can be affected by such a basis rotation. We first analyze the general analytical properties of these objects in various contexts, including the time-evolution operator of non-interacting Hamiltonians and Haar-random unitaries. We then perform a numerical investigation of the natural super-orbitals corresponding to both the time-evolution operator and a time-evolved local operator, focusing on two many-body systems: the fermionic $t\\text{-}V$ chain and an impurity model, using tensor network simulations. Our results reveal that the $t\\text{-}V$ model lacks a preferred super-orbital basis, while in the impurity model, the occupations of the natural orbitals for both operators decay exponentially at all times. This indicates that only a small number of orbitals contribute significantly to quantum correlations, enabling a compact matrix-product-operator representation and a reduced non-stabilizerness in the natural orbital basis. Finally, we examine the spatial spread of the natural orbitals for time-evolved local operators in the impurity model and show that the complexity of this operator in the natural orbital basis saturates over time. This new framework opens the door to future research that leverages the compressed structure of operators in their natural super-orbital basis, enabling for instance the computation of out-of-time-order correlators in large interacting systems over extended time scales.",

At the heart of their success lies the concept of TN ranks, which governs the efficiency and expressivity of TN decompositions. However, unlike matrix ranks, TN ranks often lack a universal meaning and an intuitive interpretation, with their properties varying significantly across different TN structures. Consequently, TN ranks are frequently treated as empirically tuned hyperparameters, rather than as key design parameters inferred from domain knowledge. The aim of this Lecture Note is therefore to demystify the foundational yet frequently misunderstood concept of TN ranks through real-life examples and intuitive visualizations. We begin by illustrating how domain knowledge can guide the selection of TN ranks in widely-used models such as the Canonical Polyadic (CP) and Tucker decompositions. For more complex TN structures, we employ a self-explanatory graphical approach that generalizes to tensors of arbitrary order. Such a perspective naturally reveals the relationship between TN ranks and the corresponding ranks of tensor unfoldings (matrices), thereby circumventing cumbersome multi-index tensor algebra while facilitating domain-informed TN design. It is our hope that this Lecture Note will equip readers with a clear and unified understanding of the concept of TN rank, along with the necessary physical insight and intuition to support the selection, explainability, and deployment of tensor methods in both practical applications and educational contexts.",

Furthermore, a three-orbital electronic Hubbard model for this chain was constructed by using the density matrix renormalization group method. A robust antiferromagnetic coupling was unveiled in the chain direction. In addition, in the intermediate electronic correlation $U/W$ region, we found an interesting orbital-selective Mott phase with the coexistence of localized and itinerant electrons ($U$ is the on-site Hubbard repulsion, while $W$ is the electronic bandwidth). Furthermore, we do not observe any obvious pairing tendency in the Fe$^{3+}$ chain in the electronic correlation $U/W$ region, where superconducting pairing tendencies were reported before in iron ladders. This suggests that superconductivity is unlikely to emerge in the Fe$^{3+}$ systems.

Starting from the continuous symmetries of the Poincar\\'e disk, we classify the irreducible representations and construct a symmetry-adapted basis, establishing a direct correspondence to the continuum Dirac theory. We show that this continuum theory predicts a finite density of states at zero energy for any finite curvature in $D-$dimensional hyperbolic space with $2\\leq D \\leq 4$, suggesting enhanced susceptibility of Dirac fermions to interaction-driven instabilities at weak coupling. We then derive explicit forms of discrete translational and rotational symmetries for lattices characterized by Schl\\\"afli symbols $\\{p,q\\}$, and explicitly construct the discrete spin connection, represented as hopping phases, via parallel transport. Our results pave the way for experimental realization of spin-curvature effects in metamaterial platforms and systematic numerical studies of correlated Dirac phases in hyperbolic geometries.",

      "abstract": "Efficient computation of Greeks for multi-asset options remains a key challenge in quantitative finance. While Monte Carlo (MC) simulation is widely used, it suffers from the large sample complexity for high accuracy. We propose a framework to compute Greeks in a single evaluation of a tensor train (TT), which is obtained by compressing the Fourier transform (FT)-based pricing function via TT learning using tensor cross interpolation. Based on this TT representation, we introduce two approaches to compute Greeks: a numerical differentiation (ND) approach that applies a numerical differential operator to one tensor core and an analytical (AN) approach that constructs the TT of closed-form differentiation expressions of FT-based pricing. Numerical experiments on a five-asset min-call option in the Black-Sholes model show significant speed-ups of up to about $10^{5} \\times$ over MC while maintaining comparable accuracy. The ND approach matches or exceeds the accuracy of the AN approach and requires lower computational complexity for constructing the TT representation, making it the preferred choice.",

We probe string modes of motion with dynamical matter in a digital quantum simulation of a (2+1) dimensional gauge theory using a superconducting quantum processor with up to 144 qubits, stretching the hardware capabilities with quantum-circuit depths comprising up to 192 two-qubit layers. We realize the $Z_2$-Higgs model ($Z_2$HM) through an optimized embedding into a heavy-hex superconducting qubit architecture, directly mapping matter and gauge fields to vertex and link superconducting qubits, respectively. Using the structure of local gauge symmetries, we implement a comprehensive suite of error suppression, mitigation, and correction strategies to enable real-time observation and manipulation of electric strings connecting dynamical charges. Our results resolve a dynamical hierarchy of longitudinal oscillations and transverse bending at the end points of the string, which are precursors to hadronization and rotational spectra of mesons. We further explore multi-string processes, observing the fragmentation and recombination of strings. The experimental design supports 300,000 measurement shots per circuit, totaling 600,000 shots per time step, enabling high-fidelity statistics. We employ extensive tensor network simulations using the basis update and Galerkin method to predict large-scale real-time dynamics and validate our error-aware protocols.

Motivated by recent observations in twisted homobilayer MoTe$_2$ and rhombohedral pentalayer graphene, where fractional Chern insulators (FCIs) appear adjacent to spin-valley-polarized superconductors, we investigate a minimal model: spinless electrons in the lowest Landau level subject to a tunable periodic potential. Large-scale density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) calculations reveal that, as the FCI gap closes, two nearly degenerate phases emerge before the system turns metallic: a chiral $f$-wave superconductor and a $\\sqrt{3} \\times \\sqrt{3}$ charge-density wave (CDW) whose energies differ by less than $1\\%$. These two competing states mirror the superconducting and re-entrant integer quantum Hall (RIQH) phases observed experimentally near the FCI regime. The superconducting dome survives realistic Coulomb interaction, light doping, and various lattice geometry. Melting the FCI therefore provides a new mechanism for realizing spin-polarized chiral superconductivity and RIQH order. We predict that twisted MoTe$_2$ at larger twist angles will develop a superconducting dome even at filling $\\nu = 2/3$, and suppressing this superconductivity with a magnetic field should drive the system into an RIQH state.",

In this work, we experimentally probe the quench spectroscopy for one-dimensional bosons in optical lattices with the presence of a harmonic trap, and comparing our results with the density matrix renormalization group simulation. For the Mott insulator phase, although a gap is still observed, the band signal is broadened along the frequency space and cut at the half Brillouin zone, which can be explained by the excitations under harmonic confinement. Comparing with the superfluid spectrum, we can see a clear distinction between the two phases and find the inverse quench with larger amplitude yields the clearest spectrum.

By means of the density matrix renormalization group calculations, we obtain the quantum phase diagram of the system by tuning $J_{\\bot}$ in a large doping range $\\delta = 1/8 - 1/2$. We find that a large $J_{\\bot}$ can always drive an interlayer superconductivity by coupling the two layers in both the Luther-Emery liquid and Luttinger liquid states. By coupling two Luther-Emery liquid states, the in-plane superconductivity evolves to inter-plane superconductivity either through an intermediate charge density wave (CDW) phase or directly, depending on doping ratio. This emergent CDW phase, which exists over a finite doping range, appears to develop from the CDW state of the two-leg ladder at $\\delta = 1/4$. By coupling two Luttinger liquids, the in-plane Luttinger liquids show a transition to the inter-plane superconducting phase at large $J_{\\bot}$, as reported in previous literature. Interestingly, in the intermediate $J_{\\bot}$ regime we find that while the in-plane Luttinger-liquid features remain stable, the inter-plane superconductivity can develop an enhanced quasi-long-range order with the power exponent $K^{zz}_{\\rm SC} \\sim 1$. At last, we show that the interlayer superconductivity is also stable by coupling the bilayer three-leg $t$-$J$ ladders by a strong $J_{\\bot}$ interaction, from both the Luther-Emery liquid and Luttinger-liquid states.",

For any entanglement-compressed quantum state with minimal expected energy, it is shown that its energy spectrum decays at most with the inverse-squared energy eigenvalues.

Here, we propose a class of multipartite entanglement measures that incorporate the matrix product state (MPS) representation, enabling the characterization of the optimality of quantum circuits for state preparation. These measures are defined as the minimal distances from a target state to the manifolds of MPSs with specified virtual bond dimensions $\\chi$, and thus are dubbed as $\\chi$-specified matrix product entanglement ($\\chi$-MPE). We demonstrate superlinear, linear, and sublinear scaling behaviors of $\\chi$-MPE with respect to the negative logarithmic fidelity $F$ in state preparation, which correspond to excessive, optimal, and insufficient circuit depth $D$ for preparing $\\chi$-virtual-dimensional MPSs, respectively. Specifically, a linearly-growing $\\chi$-MPE with $F$ suggests $\\mathcal{H}_{\\chi} \\simeq \\mathcal{H}_{D}$, where $\\mathcal{H}_{\\chi}$ denotes the manifold of the $\\chi$-virtual-dimensional MPSs and $\\mathcal{H}_{D}$ denotes that of the states accessible by the $D$ layer circuits.

      "abstract": "This work presents a computational framework for studying reaction dynamics via wavepacket propagation, employing the multiconfiguration time-dependent Hartree (MCTDH) method and its multilayer extension (ML-MCTDH) as the core methodologies. The core idea centers on the concept of modes that combine several coordinates along with their hierarchical separations because the degrees of freedom are too numerous to be efficiently treated as a single mode. First, the system is partitioned into several fragments within the same layer, and these fragments are further decomposed. Repeating this process, a hierarchical separation of modes emerges, until modes of a manageable size are achieved. Accordingly, the coordinates frame can be designed hierarchically. Second, the kinetic energy operator (KEO) is derived as a sum-of-products (SOP) of single-particle differential operators through polyspherical approach, while the potential energy surface (PES) is expressed in a similar SOP form of single-particle potentials (SPPs) through (1) reconstruction approaches using an existing PES or (2) direct approaches based on a computed database. Third, the nuclear wave function is expressed in a multi-layer expansion form, where each term is a product of single-particle functions (SPFs) that are further expanded by the SPFs in deeper layer. This expansion form is also adopted by variational eigensolver for electronic wave function. Finally, the Dirac-Frenkel variational principle leads to a set of working equations whose solutions reproduce reaction dynamics. In addition, the hierarchical framework can be rearranged by the mathematical language of tensor network (TN) or tree tensor network (TTN). In this work, we compare the methods represented by function with those in the form of TN or TTN. We also discuss the limitations of the present framework and propose solutions, providing further perspectives.",

The continuous time quantum Monte Carlo (CTQMC) methods could tackle this problem, but are only effective in the imaginary-time axis. In this work we present a method based on tensor network and the path integral formalism to solve polaron impurity problems. As both the electron and phonon baths can be integrated out via the Feynman-Vernon influence functional in the path integral formalism, our method is free of bath discretization error. It can also flexibly work on the imaginary, Keldysh, and the L-shaped Kadanoff contour. In addition, our method can naturally resolve several long-existing challenges: (i) non-diagonal hybridization function; (ii) measuring multi-time correlations beyond the single particle Green's functions. We demonstrate the effectiveness and accuracy of our method with extensive numerical examples against analytic solutions, exact diagonalization and CTQMC. We also perform full-fledged real-time calculations that have never been done before to our knowledge, which could be a benchmarking baseline for future method developments.",

We show that the tensor network simulations can be carried out solely using highly compressed tensor representations of the flow fields and the differential operators and discuss the numerical implementation of the tensor operations required for computing fluid flows in detail. The applicability of our method is demonstrated by applying it to the paradigm example of steady and transient flows around stationary and rotating cylinders. We find excellent quantitative agreement in comparison to finite difference simulations for Strouhal numbers, forces and velocity fields. The properties of our approach are discussed in terms of reduced order models. We estimate the memory saving and potential runtime advantages in comparison to standard finite difference simulations. We find accurate results with errors of less than 0.3% for flow-field compressions by a factor of up to 20 and differential operators compressed by factors of up to 1000 compared to sparse matrix representations. We provide strong numerical evidence that the runtime scaling advantages of the tensor network approach with system size will provide substantial resource savings when simulating larger systems. Finally, we note that, like other tensor network-based fluid flow simulations, our algorithmic framework is directly portable to a quantum computer leading to further scaling advantages.",

Our approach is based on axiomatizing physical boundary subalgebra of quasi-local observables, and applying ideas from algebraic quantum field theory to derive the expected categorical structures. We show that given a physical boundary subalgebra $B$ of a quasi-local algebra $A$, there is a canonical fusion category $\\mathcal{C}$ that acts on $A$ by bimodules and whose fusion ring acts by locality preserving quantum channels on the quasi-local algebra such that $B$ is recovered as the invariant operators. We show that a fusion category can be realized as symmetries of a tensor product spin chain if and only if all of its objects have integer dimensions, and that it admits an on-site action on a tensor product spin chain if and only if it admits a fiber functor. We give a formal definition of a topological symmetric state, and prove a Lieb-Schultz-Mattis type theorem. Using this, we show that for any fusion category $\\mathcal{C}$ with no fiber functor there always exists gapless pure symmetric states on an anyon chain. Finally, we apply our framework to show that any state covariant under an anomalous Kramers-Wannier type duality must be gapless.",

In spin-only Heisenberg ladders, we find immediate onset and continuous strengthening of the Haldane phase with increasing Hund's coupling. In contrast, the inclusion of charge fluctuations in Hubbard ladders leads to a nontrivial stability regime, revealing a robust yet bounded region where SPT order persists despite significant charge fluctuations. We identify distinct boundaries separating a trivial insulating phase from the Haldane SPT phase, governed by both Coulomb repulsion and Hund's coupling.

The transition occurs at a certain rate at which the disentangler acts. We analyze such games within the context of matchgate dynamics, which equivalently corresponds to evolutions of non-interacting fermions. We first investigate general entanglement properties of fermionic Gaussian states (FGS). We introduce a representation of FGS using a minimal matchgate circuit capable of preparing the state and derive an algorithm based on a generalized Yang-Baxter relation for updating this representation as unitary operations are applied. This representation enables us to define a natural disentangling procedure that reduces the number of gates in the circuit, thereby decreasing the entanglement contained in the system. We then explore different strategies to disentangle the systems and study the unitary circuit game in two different scenarios: with braiding gates, i.e., the intersection of Clifford gates and matchgates, and with generic matchgates. For each model, we observe qualitatively different entanglement transitions, which we characterize both numerically and analytically.",

In the face of daunting evidence for bulk magnetic order despite promising theoretical predictions, it naturally suggests the focus on thin films where Coulomb interactions are dimensionally quenched and may yield a more strongly correlated environment prone to magnetic ordering. Here, we combine scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), density functional theory (DFT), and density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) methods to investigate atomically ordered ultrathin RuO$_2$(110) grown on Ru(0001). Contrary to predictions of magnetic order, we observe a nonmagnetic charge density wave (CDW) instability that is driven by Fermi surface nesting within the flat-band surface state, and stabilized by the incommensurate moir\\'e stacking with the substrate. We further identify a nonmagnetic and metastable 2 $\\times$ 2 surface reconstruction that breaks in-plane mirror symmetry and can be reversibly toggled via STM tip manipulation. Our spin-polarized STM measurements find no sign of any magnetic instability at the RuO$_2$ surface. As much as our findings refute proposals for either bulk or surface magnetism in RuO$_2$, we establish ultrathin RuO$_2$(110) as an intriguing platform for exploring Moir\\'e-assisted electronic surface order.",

      "abstract": "Many robotic tasks, such as inverse kinematics, motion planning, and optimal control, can be formulated as optimization problems. Solving these problems involves addressing nonlinear kinematics, complex contact dynamics, and long-horizon planning, each posing distinct challenges for state-of-the-art optimization methods. To efficiently solve a wide range of tasks across varying scenarios, researchers either develop specialized algorithms for the task to achieve, or switch between different frameworks. Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) is a general-purpose decision-making tool that enables strategic exploration across problem instances without relying on task-specific structures. However, MCTS suffers from combinatorial complexity, leading to slow convergence and high memory usage. To address this limitation, we propose \\emph{Tensor Train Tree Search} (TTTS), which leverages tensor factorization to exploit the separable structure of decision trees. This yields a low-rank, linear-complexity representation that significantly reduces both computation time and storage requirements. We prove that TTTS can efficiently reach the bounded global optimum within a finite time. Experimental results across inverse kinematics, motion planning around obstacles, multi-stage motion planning, and bimanual whole-body manipulation demonstrate the efficiency of TTTS on a diverse set of robotic tasks.",

Here, we use the quantics tensor train representation to build a solver for the time-dependent Gross-Pitaevskii equation. We demonstrate that the quantics approach generalizes well to the presence of the non-linear term in the equation. We show that we can resolve phenomena across length scales separated by seven orders of magnitude in one dimension within one hour on a single core in a laptop, greatly surpassing the capabilities of more naive methods. We illustrate our methodology with various modulated optical trap potentials presenting features at vastly different length scales, including solutions to the Gross-Pitaevskii equation on two-dimensional grids above a trillion points ($2^{20} \\times 2^{20}$). This quantum-inspired methodology can be readily extended to other partial differential equations combining spatial and temporal evolutions, providing a powerful method to solve highly featured differential equations at unprecedented length scales.",

Two complementary algorithms are developed: an imaginary-time projector that drives the condensate toward its variational ground state and a rank-adapted fourth-order Runge-Kutta integrator for real-time dynamics. The framework captures a broad range of physical scenarios - including barrier-confined condensates, quasi-random potentials, long-range dipolar interactions, and multicomponent spinor dynamics - without leaving the compressed representation. Relative to standard discretizations, the QTT approach achieves an exponential reduction in computational resources while retaining quantitative accuracy, thereby extending the practicable regime of Gross-Pitaevskii simulations on classical hardware.

These include operator mutual information and operator entanglement entropy of the time-evolution operator, as well as more conventional diagnostics such as two-point dynamical correlations and out-of-time-ordered correlators. We demonstrate this framework by deriving exact results for eigenstate correlations in a minimal model of quantum chaos -- Floquet dual-unitary circuits. These results reveal not only the butterfly effect and the information lightcone, but also finer structures of scrambling within the lightcone. Our work thus shows how the eigenstates of a chaotic system can encode the full spatiotemporal anatomy of quantum chaos, going beyond the descriptions offered by random matrix theory and the eigenstate thermalisation hypothesis.",

These disruptions are captured in a thermodynamically extensive manner by a compact four-fermion Coupled Cluster (doubles) state (CCS). Remarkably, all properties of this state may be computed analytically by combinatorial means, and also derived from an exactly solvable correlated hopping Hamiltonian. Furthermore, this Coupled Cluster state can be re-expressed as a low-rank Matrix Product State (MPS) with bond dimension exactly four. In addition, we unveil a hidden connection between this Coupled Cluster ansatz and a Rokhsar-Kivelson state (RKS), which is the ground state of a solvable parent quantum tetramer model. The broad picture that we uncover here thus provides deep connections between several core concepts of correlated fermions and quantum chemistry that have previously enjoyed limited synergy. In contrast to a recent perturbative treatment on top of Hartree-Fock theory, our approach asymptotically captures the correct correlations in the $t$-$V$ model at small $t/V$, and remains a qualitatively accurate approximation even outside the perturbative regime.

We explore the application of tensor networks to these systems, where (in analogy to related work in fluid and plasma dynamics), they allow for physically motivated data compression that makes simulations possible on large spatial grids which would be unfeasible with direct numerical simulations. Analysing different non-equilibrium cases involving vortex formation, we find that these methods are particularly efficient, especially in combination with a matrix product operator representation of the quantum Fourier transform, which enables a spectral approach to calculation of both equilibrium states and time-dependent dynamics. The efficiency of these methods has interesting physical implications for the structure in the states that are generated by these dynamics, and provides a path to describe cold gas experiments that are challenging for existing methods.",

      "abstract": "Generalised charge pumps are topological obstructions to trivialising loops in the space of symmetric gapped Hamiltonians. We show that given mild conditions on such pumps, the associated loop has high-symmetry points which must be in distinct symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases. To further elucidate the connection between pumps and SPTs, we focus on closed paths, `pivot loops', defined by two Hamiltonians, where the first is unitarily evolved by the second `pivot' Hamiltonian. While such pivot loops have been studied as entanglers for SPTs, here we explore their connection to pumps. We construct families of pivot loops which pump charge for various symmetry groups, often leading to SPT phases -- including dipole SPTs. Intriguingly, we find examples where non-trivial pumps do not lead to genuine SPTs but still entangle representation-SPTs (RSPTs). We use the anomaly associated to the non-trivial pump to explain the a priori `unnecessary' criticality between these RSPTs. We also find that particularly nice pivot families form circles in Hamiltonian space, which we show is equivalent to the Hamiltonians satisfying the Dolan-Grady relation -- known from the study of integrable models. This additional structure allows us to derive more powerful constraints on the phase diagram. Natural examples of such circular loops arise from pivoting with the Onsager-integrable chiral clock models, containing the aforementioned RSPT example. In fact, we show that these Onsager pivots underlie general group cohomology-based pumps in one spatial dimension. Finally, we recast the above in the language of equivariant families of Hamiltonians and relate the invariants of the pump to the candidate SPTs. We also highlight how certain SPTs arise in cases where the equivariant family is labelled by spaces that are not manifolds.",

We show that the Hilbert space is comprised of a certain number of towers whose number depends on the number of boundary bound states exhibited by the system. The system undergoes boundary phase transitions when boundary fields are varied across certain critical values. There exist two types of phase transitions. In the first type the ground state of the system undergoes a change. In the second type, named the `Eigenstate phase transition', the number of towers of the Hilbert space changes, which is again associated with the change in the number of boundary bound states exhibited by the system. We use the DMRG and exact diagonalization techniques to probe the signature of the Eigenstate phase transition and the ground state phase transition by analyzing the spin profiles in each eigenstate.",

This, in particular, allows us to extract the diffusion constant. For large $k$, the leading Ruelle-Pollicott resonance is not related to transport and governs the exponential decay of correlation functions. Additionally, we conjecture the existence of a continuum of eigenvalues below the leading diffusive resonance, which governs non-exponential decay, for instance, power-law hydrodynamic tails.

Our key technical contribution is a matrix-free algorithmic framework that avoids the explicit construction and storage of large unitary matrices acting on the whole Hilbert space. Instead, we evaluate all quantities as sums over state vectors, assuming that these vectors can be stored in memory. We develop HPC-optimized kernels for applying gates to state vectors and for the gradient and Hessian computation. Further improvements are achieved by exploiting sparsity structures due to Hamiltonian conservation laws, such as parity conservation, and lattice translation invariance. We benchmark our implementation on the Fermi-Hubbard model with up to 16 sites, demonstrating a nearly linear parallelization speed-up with up to 112 CPU threads.

Consequently, the extended cNMSSE is applicable to environments beyond those characterized by Debye-type spectral densities. The flexibility to employ general basis functions is particularly advantageous for handling spectral densities with higher-order poles, for which exponential decompositions are often inaccurate or unavailable. The extended cNMSSE is implemented in a pseudo-Fock space using conventional ladder operators and solved efficiently via matrix product state (MPS) techniques, preserving the favorable linear-scaling and wavefunction-based nature of the original method. Benchmark simulations across four representative cases, including discrete spectral density, Ohmic spectral density with exponential and algebraic cutoffs, and critically damped Brownian spectral density, demonstrate excellent agreement with results of hierarchy of forward-backward stochastic Schr\\\"odinger equations (HFB-SSE) and extended hierarchical equation of motion (HEOM).",

We overcome this limitation by designing a bilayer quantum Hall system that hosts an Ising tricritical point -- a nontrivial fixed point where first-order and second-order transitions meet -- which flows to the conformally coupled scalar theory in the infrared. The critical energy spectrum and operator structure match those at the Gaussian fixed point, providing nonperturbative evidence for the emergence of a free scalar CFT. Our results expand the landscape of CFTs realizable on the fuzzy sphere and demonstrate that even free bosonic theories -- previously inaccessible -- can emerge from interacting electrons in this framework.",

Using the 1D Heisenberg chain as a benchmark system, we observe a negative spinon spin current exhibiting algebraic scaling $T^{\\alpha}$, with exponent $\\alpha$, in the Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid phase. On the triangular lattice, spin frustration dramatically enhances the low-temperature SSE, with distinct spin-current signatures - particularly the sign reversal and characteristic temperature dependence - distinguishing different spin states. Remarkably, we discover a persistent, negative spin current in the spin supersolid phase. It saturates to a non-zero value in the low-temperature limit, and can be ascribed to the Goldstone-mode-mediated spin supercurrents. Moreover, a universal scaling $T^{d/z}$ is found at the U(1)-symmetric polarization quantum critical points. These distinct quantum spin transport traits provide sensitive probes for spin-supersolid compounds such as Na$_2$BaCo(PO$_4$)$_2$.

We prove that, for $N \\geq 4r + 1$, 1D QCAs all admit causal decompositions: a unitary channel is a 1D QCA if and only if it can be decomposed into a unitary routed circuit of nearest-neighbour interactions, in which its causal structure is compositionally obvious.

Leveraging the rich properties of CP decomposition, we propose a CP-based low-rank tensor function parameterized by neural networks for implicit neural representation (CP-INR). This approach enables continuous data representation beyond structured grids, fully exploiting the non-linearity of tensor data with theoretical guarantees on excess risk bounds. To achieve a sparse CP decomposition, we introduce a variational form of the Schatten-p quasi-norm and prove its relationship to multilinear rank minimization. For smoothness, we propose a regularization term based on the spectral norm of the Jacobian and Hutchinson's trace estimator. Our proposed smoothness regularization is SVD-free and avoids explicit chain rule derivations. It can serve as an alternative to Total Variation (TV) regularization in image denoising tasks and is naturally applicable to continuous data.

Starting from the quantum master equation for the system alone, it is known that the joint dynamics of the system and its environment can be obtained by dilation, leading to a closed dynamics for a continuous matrix product state. Performing counting measurements on the environment gives rise to stochastic dynamics of quantum trajectories for the system, which when averaged yield back the quantum master equation. In this work, we identify necessary and sufficient conditions under which the dynamics of these different descriptions retain the weak symmetry of the quantum master equation and we characterise the resulting symmetries of the different descriptions in terms of their generators. We find that the joint dynamics always features a separable symmetry directly related to that of the quantum master equation, but for quantum trajectories the corresponding symmetry is present only if the counting measurement satisfies certain conditions.",

However, its application to three-dimensional systems remains limited, primarily due to the high computational cost associated with evaluating the free energy density and its gradient. This process requires contracting a triple-layer tensor network composed of a projected entangled pair operator and projected entangled pair states. In this paper, we employ a split corner-transfer renormalization group scheme tailored for the contraction of such triple-layer networks, which reduces the computational complexity from $\\mathcal{O}(D^{12})$ in conventional methods to $\\mathcal{O}(D^{9})$. Through numerical benchmarks on the three-dimensional classical Ising model, we demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves numerical results comparable to the most recent Monte Carlo simulations, while also providing a substantial speedup over previous variational tensor network approaches. This makes this method well-suited for efficient gradient-based optimization in three-dimensional tensor network simulations.",

At zero temperature and along the symmetry line of the phase diagram, we find a sequence of inhomogeneous ground states that arise through a real-space version of the mechanism of Hilbert-space fragmentation. For weak interactions, doping the symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phase of the GNW model leads to localized charges or holes at periodic arrangements of immobile topological defects separating the fragmented subchains: a topological crystal. Increasing the interactions, we observe a transition into a parity-broken phase with a pseudoscalar condensate displaying a modulated periodic pattern. This soliton lattice is a sequence of topological charges corresponding to anti-kinks, which also bind the doped fermions at their respective centers. Out of this symmetry line, we show that quasi-spiral profiles appear with a characteristic wavevector set by the density $k = 2{\\pi}{\\rho}$, providing non-perturbative evidence for chiral spirals beyond the large-N limit. These results demonstrate that various exotic inhomogeneous phases can arise in lattice field theories, and motivate the use of quantum simulators to confirm such QCD-inspired phenomena in future experiments.",

      "abstract": "False vacuum decay in scalar quantum field theory (QFT) plays a central role in cosmology and particle physics but has remained intractable for classical simulation due to its non-perturbative, highly entangled dynamics. We present a novel method for Hamiltonian simulation of false-vacuum decay in a self-interacting scalar QFT, based on a spatial discretisation into a lattice of bosonic modes. Each mode has a continuous or quasi-continuous local Hilbert space whose dimension is large enough to capture the self-interactions in the Hamiltonian. We refer to these local modes generically as ``qumodes'', echoing the ideal case in which the lattice would be realised on a continuous-variable quantum computer. Here we show that the same framework can be implemented on a tensor network, in which case the qumodes are quasi-continuous, corresponding to the local sites of the network having a very high dimensional Hilbert space. Using a time-evolving block decimation algorithm with Trotterised time evolution, we capture the real-time dynamics of the scalar field. In (1+1)-dimensions, we initialise a metastable vacuum and observe the coherent entanglement growth that seeds true-vacuum bubble nucleation. Our approach establishes the qumode network as a scalable framework for non-equilibrium scalar QFT phenomena and paves the way for higher-dimensional studies and continuous-variable quantum computing implementations.",

      "abstract": "Existing quantum state tomography methods are limited in scalability due to their high computation and memory demands, making them impractical for recovery of large quantum states. In this work, we address these limitations by reformulating the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) problem using the Burer-Monteiro factorization, resulting in a non-convex but low-rank parameterization of the density matrix. We derive a fully unconstrained formulation by analytically eliminating the trace-one and positive semidefinite constraints, thereby avoiding the need for projection steps during optimization. Furthermore, we determine the Lagrange multiplier associated with the unit-trace constraint a priori, reducing computational overhead. The resulting formulation is amenable to scalable first-order optimization, and we demonstrate its tractability using limited-memory BFGS (L-BFGS). Importantly, we also propose a low-memory version of the above algorithm to fully recover certain large quantum states with Pauli-based POVM measurements. Our low-memory algorithm avoids explicitly forming any density matrix, and does not require the density matrix to have a matrix product state (MPS) or other tensor structure. For a fixed number of measurements and fixed rank, our algorithm requires just $\\mathcal{O}(d \\log d)$ complexity per iteration to recover a $d \\times d$ density matrix. Additionally, we derive a useful error bound that can be used to give a rigorous termination criterion. We numerically demonstrate that our method is competitive with state-of-the-art algorithms for moderately sized problems, and then demonstrate that our method can solve a 20-qubit problem on a laptop in under 5 hours.",

This paper proposes TensorGuide, a novel tensor-train-guided adaptation framework to overcome these limitations. TensorGuide generates two correlated low-rank LoRA matrices through a unified TT structure driven by controlled Gaussian noise. The resulting joint TT representation inherently provides structured, low-rank adaptations, significantly enhancing expressivity, generalization, and parameter efficiency without increasing the number of trainable parameters. Theoretically, we justify these improvements through neural tangent kernel analyses, demonstrating superior optimization dynamics and enhanced generalization. Extensive experiments on quantum dot classification and GPT-2 fine-tuning benchmarks demonstrate that TensorGuide-based LoRA consistently outperforms standard LoRA and TT-LoRA, achieving improved accuracy and scalability with fewer parameters.",

Using a combination of tensor network methods and Monte Carlo simulations, we reveal a non-monotonic, dome-like dependence of $T_c$ on the modulation wavelength, with the peak $T_c$ shifting to longer wavelengths as the modulation strength grows. The origin of this phenomenon is traced back to an effective pinning of vortices in the valleys of the modulation, confirmed by a comparison to modulated $q$-state clock models.

      "abstract": "Tensor decompositions, which represent an $N$-order tensor using approximately $N$ factors of much smaller dimensions, can significantly reduce the number of parameters. This is particularly beneficial for high-order tensors, as the number of entries in a tensor grows exponentially with the order. Consequently, they are widely used in signal recovery and data analysis across domains such as signal processing, machine learning, and quantum physics. A computationally and memory-efficient approach to these problems is to optimize directly over the factors using local search algorithms such as gradient descent, a strategy known as the factorization approach in matrix and tensor optimization. However, the resulting optimization problems are highly nonconvex due to the multiplicative interactions between factors, posing significant challenges for convergence analysis and recovery guarantees. In this paper, we present a unified framework for the factorization approach to solving various tensor decomposition problems. Specifically, by leveraging the canonical form of tensor decompositions--where most factors are constrained to be orthonormal to mitigate scaling ambiguity--we apply Riemannian gradient descent (RGD) to optimize these orthonormal factors on the Stiefel manifold. Under a mild condition on the loss function, we establish a Riemannian regularity condition for the factorized objective and prove that RGD converges to the ground-truth tensor at a linear rate when properly initialized. Notably, both the initialization requirement and the convergence rate scale polynomially rather than exponentially with $N$, improving upon existing results for Tucker and tensor-train format tensors.",

      "abstract": "Motivated by recent experiments, we investigate the spin-1/2 XXZ model on the triangular lattice with strong Ising anisotropy, combining large-scale numerical simulations and analytical methods to uncover unconventional spin dynamics. First, we compute the dynamical spin structure factor using density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations and find excellent agreement with inelastic neutron scattering data on the layered compound $\\text{K}_2\\text{Co}(\\text{SeO}_3)_2$. The low-energy spectrum reveals a roton-like minimum at the $M$ point, absent in linear spin-wave theory, accompanied by peak intensity and a broad continuum above it. Near the $\\Gamma$ point, we observe an approximately linear dispersion with vanishing spectral weight. Second, we compare two analytical frameworks that reproduce the observed features. The first is a hard-core boson approach, which includes: (i) an effective staggered boson model (ESBM) at zero magnetic field, (ii) perturbation theory applied to the one-third magnetization plateau, and (iii) a self-consistent mean-field Schwinger boson theory (SBT). The second framework is based on a variational supersolid quantum dimer model (QDM) ansatz, combined with a single-mode approximation. The SBT captures the broad continuum, the $M$-point minimum, and linear dispersion at $\\Gamma$, whereas the QDM reproduces the roton minimum and linear dispersion at finite momentum near $\\Gamma$. Remarkably, both the QDM wavefunction and the DMRG ground state exhibit nearly identical structure factors with pronounced transverse photon-like excitations. Together, our comprehensive theoretical and numerical analysis elucidates the microscopic origin of supersolid excitations in the XXZ triangular lattice model and their proximity to a spin liquid phase observed experimentally.",

To illustrate the method, we study the collective behavior of $N$ confined planar rotors with dipole-dipole interactions, a system known to exhibit a quantum phase transition from a disordered to an ordered state at zero temperature. Ground state properties are obtained using the Path Integral Ground State (PIGS) method. We propose a Bond-Hamiltonian decomposition for the high temperature density matrix factorization of the imaginary time propagator. We show that \\textit{cluster-loop} type moves are necessary to overcome ergodicity issues and to achieve efficient Markov Chain updates. Ground state energies and angular momentum properties are computed and compared with Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) benchmark results. In particular, the derivative of the kinetic energy with respect to the interaction strength estimator is presented as a successful order parameter for the detection of the quantum phase transition.",

The versatility of systems like LTNs and DeepProbLog, however, makes them less efficient in simpler settings, for instance, for discriminative machine learning, in particular in domains with many constants. Therefore, we follow a different approach: We propose to enhance symbolic machine learning schemes by giving them access to neural embeddings. In the present paper, we show this for TILDE and embeddings of constants used by TILDE in similarity predicates. The approach can be fine-tuned by further refining the embeddings depending on the symbolic theory. In experiments in three real-world domain, we show that this simple, yet effective, approach outperforms all other baseline methods in terms of the F1 score. The approach could be useful beyond this setting: Enhancing symbolic learners in this way could be extended to similarities between instances (effectively working like kernels within a logical language), for analogical reasoning, or for propositionalization.",

We indeed study the expressibility of parametrized quantum circuit commonly used in QNN applications and contrast it to those of two classes of states that can be efficiently simulated classically: matrix-product states (MPS), and Clifford-enhanced MPS (CMPS), obtained by applying a set of Clifford gates to MPS. In addition to expressibility, we assess the level of primary quantum resources, entanglement and non-stabilizerness (a.k.a. \"magic\"), in random ensembles of such quantum states, tracking their convergence to the Haar distribution. While MPS require a large number of parameters to reproduce an arbitrary quantum state, we find that CMPS approach the Haar distribution more rapidly, in terms of both entanglement and magic.

They are typically deployed on low-end devices, like mobile phones and single-board computers. Unlike LLMs, which rely on increasing model size for better generalisation, SLMs designed for edge applications are expected to have adaptivity to the deployment environments and energy efficiency given the device battery life constraints, which are not addressed in datacenter-deployed LLMs. This paper addresses these two requirements by proposing a training-free token embedding compression approach using Tensor-Train Decomposition (TTD). Each pre-trained token embedding vector is converted into a lower-dimensional Matrix Product State (MPS). We comprehensively evaluate the extracted low-rank structures across compression ratio, language task performance, latency, and energy consumption on a typical low-end device, i.e. Raspberry Pi. Taking the sub-billion parameter versions of GPT-2/Cerebres-GPT and OPT models as examples, our approach achieves a comparable language task performance to the original model with around $2.0\\times$ embedding layer compression, while the energy consumption of a single query drops by half.",

Using a valence bond solid ansatz corroborated by density matrix renormalization group simulations, we investigate the nature of magnon and spinon excitations through the single-mode approximation. We show that the magnon develops an incommensurate dispersion at $J_2 \\approx 0.32J_1$, while the spinons, viewed as domain walls between degenerate valence bond solid states, become incommensurate at $J_2 \\approx 0.4J_1$ beyond the Lifshitz point ($J_2 \\approx 0.388J_1$). The dynamical structure factor exhibits rich spectral features shaped by the interplay between these excitations, with magnons appearing as resonances embedded in the spinon continuum. The spinon gap shows a nonmonotonic behavior, reaching a peak near the center of the partially dimerized phase and closing at the boundaries, suggesting the appearance of a floating phase as a result of the condensation of incommensurate spinons. Comparative analysis with the spin-$5/2$ case confirms the universality of these phenomena across half-integer higher-spin systems. Our results provide detailed insight into how fractionalization and incommensurate condensation govern the spectral properties of frustrated spin chains, offering a unified picture across different spin magnitudes.",

      "abstract": "Quantum computation offers significant potential for accelerating the simulation of molecules and materials through algorithms such as quantum phase estimation (QPE). However, the expected speedup in ground-state energy estimation depends critically on the ability to efficiently prepare an initial state with high overlap with the true ground state. For strongly correlated molecules such as iron-sulfur clusters, this overlap is demonstrated to decay exponentially with system size. To alleviate this problem, we introduce an efficient classical algorithm to find entanglement-minimized orbitals (EMOs) using spin-adapted matrix product states (MPS) with small bond dimensions. The EMO basis yields a more compact ground-state representation, significantly easing initial state preparation for challenging systems. Our algorithm improves initial state overlap by nearly an order of magnitude over prior orbital optimization approaches for an iron-sulfur cluster with four irons, and is scalable to larger systems with many unpaired electrons, including the P-cluster and FeMo-cofactor in nitrogenase with eight transition metal centers. For these systems, we achieve substantial enhancements on initial state overlap by factors of $O(10^2)$ and $O(10^5)$, respectively, compared to results obtained using localized orbitals. Our results show that initial state preparation for these challenging systems requires far fewer resources than prior estimates suggested.",

      "abstract": "The multipoint numerical renormalization group (mpNRG) is a powerful impurity solver that provides accurate spectral data useful for computing local, dynamic correlation functions in imaginary or real frequencies non-perturbatively across a wide range of interactions and temperatures. It gives access to a local, non-perturbative four-point vertex in imaginary and real frequencies, which can be used as input for subsequent computations such as diagrammatic extensions of dynamical mean--field theory. However, computing and manipulating the real-frequency four-point vertex on large, dense grids quickly becomes numerically challenging when the density and/or the extent of the frequency grid is increased. In this paper, we compute four-point vertices in a strongly compressed quantics tensor train format using quantics tensor cross interpolation, starting from discrete partial spectral functions obtained from mpNRG. This enables evaluations of the vertex on frequency grids with resolutions far beyond the reach of previous implementations. We benchmark this approach on the four-point vertex of the single-impurity Anderson model across a wide range of physical parameters, both in its full form and its asymptotic decomposition. For imaginary frequencies, the full vertex can be represented to an accuracy on the order of $2\\cdot 10^{-3}$ with maximum bond dimensions not exceeding 120. The more complex full real-frequency vertex requires maximum bond dimensions not exceeding 170 for an accuracy of $\\lesssim 2\\%$.

In this work, we extend the entanglement-based diagnostic tools by demonstrating that the edge anomaly is manifested not only in the entanglement spectrum but also in the reduced density matrix itself, a phenomenon we refer to as the mixed state anomaly. Focusing on the two-dimensional $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ SPT phase, we show that this anomaly is subtly encoded in symmetry-twisted mixed states, leading to a topological contribution to the disorder parameter beyond the area law, as well as a spontaneous-symmetry-breaking type long-range order when time reversal symmetry is present.",

We found significant overlap in features among the packages when comparing key aspects, such as parallelism strategies for high-performance computing and symmetry-adapted formulations that enhance efficiency. This overlap suggests opportunities for modularization of common operations, including tensor operations, symmetry representations, and eigensolvers, as the packages are mostly independent and share few third-party library dependencies where functionality is factored out. More widespread modularization and standardization would result in reduced duplication of efforts and improved interoperability. We believe that the proliferation of packages and the current lack of standard interfaces and modularity are more social than technical. We aim to raise awareness of existing packages, guide researchers in finding a suitable package for their needs, and help developers identify opportunities for collaboration, modularity standardization, and optimization. Ultimately, this work emphasizes the value of greater cohesion and modularity, which would benefit DMRG software, allowing these powerful algorithms to tackle more complex and ambitious problems.",

Applied to the transverse-field Ising model with both short- and long-range interactions, our method achieves comparable ground state energy errors with state-of-the-art matrix product states and lower energies than autoregressive NQS. For systems up to 50 spins, we demonstrate high accuracy and robust convergence across a wide range of coupling strengths, including regimes where competing methods fail.

      "abstract": "The solutions to many problems in the mathematical, computational, and physical sciences often involve multidimensional integrals. A direct numerical evaluation of the integral incurs a computational cost that is exponential in the number of dimensions, a phenomenon called the curse of dimensionality. The problem is so substantial that one usually employs sampling methods, like Monte Carlo, to avoid integration altogether. Here, we derive and implement a quantum algorithm to compress a multidimensional integrand into a product of matrix-valued functions - a spectral tensor train - changing the computational complexity of integration from exponential to polynomial. The algorithm compresses the integrand by applying a sequence of quantum gates to an unentangled quantum state, where each term corresponds to a body-ordered term in the potential. Because it allows for the systematic elimination of small contributions to the integral through decimation, we call the method integral decimation. The functions in the spectral basis are analytically differentiable and integrable, and in applications to the partition function, integral decimation numerically factorizes an interacting system into a product of noninteracting ones. We illustrate integral decimation by evaluating the absolute free energy and entropy of a chiral XY model as a continuous function of temperature. We also compute the nonequilibrium time-dependent reduced density matrix of a quantum chain with between two and forty levels, each coupled to colored noise. When other methods provide numerical solutions to these models, they quantitatively agree with integral decimation. When conventional methods become intractable, integral decimation can be a powerful alternative.",

      "abstract": "The Quantum Fisher Information (QFI) is a geometric measure of state deformation calculated along the trajectory parameterizing an ensemble of quantum states. It serves as a key concept in quantum metrology, where it is linked to the fundamental limit on the precision of the parameter that we estimate. However, the QFI is notoriously difficult to calculate due to its non-linear mathematical form. For mixed states, standard numerical procedures based on eigendecomposition quickly become impractical with increasing system size. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a novel numerical approach based on Lyapunov integrals that combines the concept of symmetric logarithmic derivative and tensor networks. Importantly, this approach requires only the elementary matrix product states algorithm for time-evolution, opening a perspective for broad usage and application to many-body systems. We discuss the advantages and limitations of our methodology through an illustrative example in quantum metrology, where the thermal state of the transverse-field Ising model is used to measure magnetic field amplitude.",

This model mimics the dynamics of a structured subsystem locally coupled to a maximally random environment. We prove the exponential decay of all higher-order OTOCs and fully characterize the relevant time scales, showing how local operators approach free independence at late times. We show that the effects of the environment on the local subsystem can be captured in a higher-order influence matrix, which allows for a Markovian description of the dynamics provided an auxiliary degree of freedom is introduced. This degree of freedom directly yields a dynamical picture for the OTOCs in terms of free cumulants from free probability, consistent with recent predictions from the full eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH). This approach and the relevant influence matrix are expected to be applicable in more general settings and present a first step to characterizing quantum memory in higher-order OTOCs.",

      "abstract": "When a system exhibits a bulk gap but gapless edge states (e.g., a symmetry-protected topological phase), the entanglement spectrum (ES) resembles the energy spectrum on virtual edge, that is the Li-Haldane conjecture. In this way, the ES plays an important probe to detect the topological phases according to this bulk-edge correspondence. When a system is fully gapped, both in bulk and edge, the ES still remains similar to the virtual edge spectrum which can be explained by the recently proposed wormhole effect in the path integral of reduced density matrix. However, what will happen in the ES when the system is fully gapless? We find that though the ES roughly seems like an edge energy spectrum, and it actually contains relevant long-range interaction which modifies the intrinsic physics of entanglement Hamiltonian (EH). Moreover, the mechanism of short-/long-range interaction in EH can be understood as the confinement/deconfinement of worldlines in a path integral of reduced density matrix. Our work demonstrates that the gapless mode can induce a long-range interaction in EH.",

We define the entropy of a bulk region in an RTN by removing tensors in that region and computing the entropy of the open legs thus generated in the \"hollowed\" RTN. We thus derive the BP proposal for RTNs and hence, also for fixed-geometry states in gravity. By then expressing a general holographic state as a superposition over fixed-geometry states and using a diagonal approximation, we provide a general gravitational path integral derivation of the BP proposal. We demonstrate that the saddles computing the R\\'enyi entropy $S_n$ depend on how the bulk region is gauge-invariantly specified.

In this work, we investigate how individual two-body operators influence the global dynamics of circuits composed of dual-unitaries. We study their effect on entanglement generation while examining it from both bipartite and multipartite perspectives. Here we also highlight the significant role of local unitaries in the dynamics when paired with operators from the dual-unitary class, showing that systems with identical entangling power can exhibit a range of differing entanglement growth rates. Furthermore, we present calculations establishing time-step-dependent lower bounds, which depend on both the initial state and the entangling power of the constituent operators. Finally, we find that time-evolving an initial state composed of pair products generates a state with nearly maximal multipartite entanglement content, approaching the bounds established by Absolutely Maximally Entangled (AME) states.",

Unlike LoRA, which fine-tunes each weight matrix independently, MetaTT uses a single shared TT to factorize all transformer sub-modules -- query, key, value, projection, and feed-forward layers -- by indexing the structural axes like layer and matrix type, and optionally heads and tasks. For a given rank, while LoRA adds parameters proportional to the product across modes, MetaTT only adds parameters proportional to the sum across modes leading to a significantly compressed final adapter. Our benchmarks compare MetaTT with LoRA along with recent state-of-the-art matrix and tensor decomposition based fine-tuning schemes. We observe that when tested on standard language modeling benchmarks, MetaTT leads to the most reduction in the parameters while maintaining similar accuracy to LoRA and even outperforming other tensor-based methods. Unlike CP or other rank-factorizations, the TT ansatz benefits from mature optimization routines -- e.g., DMRG-style rank adaptive minimization in addition to Adam, which we find simplifies training. Because new modes can be appended cheaply, MetaTT naturally extends to shared adapters across many tasks without redesigning the core tensor.",

      "abstract": "Fractional quantum Hall (FQH) states and superconductors typically require contrasting conditions, yet recent experiments have observed them in the same device. A natural explanation is that mobile anyons give rise to superconductivity; however, this mechanism requires binding of minimally charged anyons to establish an unusual energy hierarchy. This scenario has mostly been studied with effective theories, leaving open the question of how anyon superconductivity can arise from repulsive interactions. Here, we show that such an energy hierarchy of anyons arises naturally in fractional Chern insulators (FCIs) at fillings $\\nu = 2/(4p \\mp 1)$ when they are driven toward a quantum phase transition into a ``semion crystal'' -- an exotic charge-density-wave (CDW) insulator with semion topological order. Near the transition, Cooper-pair correlations are enhanced, so that a conventional charge-2e superconductor appears with doping. Guided by these insights, we analyze a microscopic realization in a repulsive Hubbard-Hofstadter model. Tensor network simulations at $\\nu = 2/3$ reveal a robust FCI that, with increasing interactions, transitions into the semion crystal. Finding a stable semion crystal in such a minimal model highlights it as a viable state competing with conventional CDW and FQH states. In the vicinity of this transition, we find markedly enhanced Cooper pairing, consistent with our theory that the 2e/3 anyon is cheaper than a pair of isolated e/3 anyons. Doping near the transition should in general lead to doping Cooper pairs and charge-2e superconductivity, with chiral edge modes of alternating central charge $c = \\pm2$, which can coexist with translation symmetry breaking. Our framework unifies recent approaches to anyon superconductivity, reconciles it with strong repulsion and provides guidance for flat band moir\\'e materials such as recent experiments in twisted MoTe$_2$.",

Our developments stem from three technical inventions: (i) constructing matrix product operators (MPO) of transcorrelated Hamiltonians with low bond dimension and high sparsity, (ii) exploiting the entanglement structure of the ground states to increase the accuracy of the MPS representation, and (iii) optimizing the non-linear parameter of the Gutzwiller correlator to mitigate the non-variational nature of the transcorrelated method. We examine systems of size up to $12 \\times 12$ lattice sites, four times larger than previous transcorrelated DMRG studies, and demonstrate that transcorrelated DMRG yields significant improvements over standard non-transcorrelated DMRG for equivalent computational effort.

      "abstract": "Static disorder plays a crucial role in the electronic dynamics and spectroscopy of complex molecular systems. Traditionally, obtaining observables averaged over static disorder requires thousands of realizations via direct sampling of the disorder distribution, leading to high computational costs. In this work, we extend the auxiliary degree-of-freedom based matrix product state (MPS) method to handle system-bath correlated thermal equilibrium initial states. We validate the effectiveness of the extended method by computing the dipole-dipole time correlation function of the Holstein model relevant to the emission spectrum of molecular aggregates. Our results show that the method accurately captures static disorder effects using a one-shot quantum dynamical simulation, with only a moderate increase in MPS bond dimension, thereby significantly reducing computational cost. Moreover, it enables the generation of a much larger number of samples than the conventional direct sampling method at negligible additional cost, thus reducing statistical errors. This method provides a broadly useful tool for calculating equilibrium time correlation functions in system-bath coupled models with static disorder.",

      "abstract": "We study the interplay between on-site disorder and fermion pairing on the quasi one-dimensional flat band Creutz lattice. Both disorder and flat bands localize particles, but an attractive interaction results in pair formation and delocalization giving rise to superconductivity. In this work, we examine the attractive Hubbard model on the Creutz lattice to study the competition between these two effects and elucidate the properties of the superconducting phase and the localization quantum phase transition as the disorder strength is increased. Our main result is that flat band superconductivity is robust against disorder: The critical disorder strength, $W_c$, required to localize the fermion pairs and destroy superconductivity, is finite at any interaction strength, $U$, and is proportional to the superconducting weight, $D_s$, of the clean system. Using large scale density matrix renormalization group computations, we show that this transition is of the BKT form. In addition, even at very small interaction strength, the localization is not due to single fermion localization but to pair localization. For completeness, we briefly study this disorder-induced localization with mean field theory and show that $W_c$ can be accurately determined by using an appropriate scaling function.",

In holography, quantum information theory provides a crucial tool that directly connects microscopic structures of these systems to the geometries of gravitational spacetimes. One manifestation is that the entanglement entropy in quantum many-body systems can be calculated from the area of an extremal surface in the corresponding gravitational spacetime. This implies that a gravitational spacetime can emerge from an enormous number of entangled qubits. In this Essay, I will discuss open problems in this area of research, considering recent developments and outlining future prospects towards a complete understanding of quantum gravity. The first step in this direction is to understand what kind of quantum circuits each holographic spacetime corresponds to, drawing on recent developments in quantum complexity theories and studying concrete examples of holography in string theory. Next, we should extend the concept of holography to general spacetimes, e.g., those spacetimes which appear in realistic cosmologies, by utilizing the connections between quantum information and holography. To address the fundamental question of how time emerges, I will propose the concepts of pseudo-entropy and time-like entanglement as a useful tool in our exploration.",

      "abstract": "Holographic quantum error-correcting codes, often realized through tensor network architectures, have emerged as compelling toy models for exploring bulk-boundary duality in AdS-CFT. By encoding bulk information into highly entangled boundary degrees of freedom, they capture key features of holography such as subregion duality, operator reconstruction, and complementary recovery. Among them, hyperinvariant tensor networks-characterized by the inclusion of edge tensors and the enforcement of multi-tensor isometries-offer a promising platform for realizing features such as state dependence and nontrivial boundary correlations. However, existing constructions are largely confined to two-dimensional regular tilings, and the structural principles underlying hyperinvariance remain poorly understood, especially in higher dimensions. To address this, we introduce a geometric criterion called angular k-uniformity, which refines standard k-uniformity and its planar variants by requiring isometric behavior within angular sectors of a tensor's rotationally symmetric layout. This condition enables the systematic identification and construction of hyperinvariant holographic codes on regular hyperbolic honeycombs in arbitrary dimension, and extends naturally to heterogeneous networks and qLEGO architectures beyond regular tilings. Altogether, angular k-uniformity provides a versatile, geometry-aware framework for analyzing and designing holographic tensor networks and codes with hyperinvariant features such as nontrivial boundary correlations and state-dependent complementary recovery.",

In this paper, we prove that the proposal of real-time estimators of scattering observables is universally applicable to all scattering observables of gapped quantum field theories. All finite-volume errors are exponentially suppressed, and the rate of this suppression is controlled by the regulator considered, namely, a displacement of the spectrum of the theory into the complex plane. A partial restoration of Lorentz symmetry by averaging over different boosts gives an additional suppression of finite volume errors. Our results also apply to the simulation of wavepacket scattering, where a similar averaging is performed to construct the wavepackets that regulate the finite volume effects.

      "abstract": "Numerical simulations of turbulent fluids are paramount to real-life applications, from predicting and modeling flows to diagnostic purposes in engineering. However, they are also computationally challenging due to their intrinsically non-linear dynamics, which requires a very high spatial resolution to accurately describe them. A promising idea is to represent flows on a discrete mesh using tensor trains (TTs), featuring a convenient scaling of the number of parameters with the mesh size. However, it is yet not clear how the compression power of TTs is affected by the complexity of the flows, measured by the Reynolds number. In fact, no TT fluid solver has been extensively validated in a fully developed turbulent regime yet. We fill this gap. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of TTs as an Ansatz to compress, simulate, and synthetically generate fiducial turbulent snapshots in 3D. Specifically, first, we exhaustively investigate the effect of TT compression of given snapshots on key turbulence signatures, including the energy spectrum and different accuracy metrics. Second, we present a TT solver to simulate time evolution of 3D fluid fields according to the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations entirely within the compressed representation. Third, we develop a TT algorithm to generate artificial snapshots displaying all the signatures of turbulence. In all three cases, a number of parameters scaling polylogarithmically with the mesh size is enough for accurate descriptions. Our findings confirm that fluids in truly turbulent regimes admit an efficient TT description and offer a powerful, quantum-inspired toolkit for their computational treatment.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, we introduce a ``CFT factory'' : a novel algorithm of methodically generating 2D lattice models that would flow to 2D conformal fixed points in the infrared. These 2D models are realised by giving critical boundary conditions to 3D topological orders (symTOs/symTFTs) described by string-net models, often called the strange correlators. We engineer these critical boundary conditions by introducing a commensurate amount of non-commuting anyon condensates. The non-invertible symmetries preserved at the critical point can be controlled by studying a novel ``refined condensation tree''. Our structured method generates an infinite family of critical lattice models, including the A-series minimal models, and uncovers previously unknown critical points. Notably, we find at least three novel critical points (c$\\approx 1.3$, $1.8$, and $2.5$ respectively) preserving the Haagerup symmetries, in addition to recovering previously reported ones. The condensation tree, together with a generalised Kramers-Wannier duality, predicts precisely large swathes of phase boundaries, fixes almost completely the global phase diagram, and sieves out second order phase transitions. This is not only illustrated in well-known examples (such as the 8-vertex model related to the $A_5$ category) but also further verified with precision numerics, using our improved (non-invertible) symmetry-preserving tensor-network RG, in novel examples involving the Haagerup symmetries. We show that critical couplings can be precisely encoded in the categorical data (Frobenius algebras and quantum dimensions in unitary fusion categories), thus establishing a powerful, systematic route to discovering and potentially classifying new conformal field theories.",

Tensor networks can also represent these states, have more structure and are easier to optimize. However, they can be prohibitively costly computationally in two or higher dimensions. Here, we propose a generalization of the perceptron - the perceptrain - which borrows features from the two different formalisms. We construct variational many-body ansatz from a simple network of perceptrains. The network can be thought of as a neural network with a few distinct features inherited from tensor networks. These include efficient local optimization akin to the density matrix renormalization algorithm, instead of optimizing of all the parameters at once; the possibility to dynamically increase the number of parameters during the optimization; the possibility to compress the state to avoid overfitting; and a structure that remains quantum-inspired. We showcase the ansatz using a combination of Variational Monte-Carlo (VMC) and Green Function Monte-Carlo (GFMC) on a $10\\times 10$ transverse field quantum Ising model with a long range $1/r^6$ antiferromagnetic interaction. The model corresponds to the Rydberg (cold) atoms platform proposed for quantum annealing. We consistently find a very high relative accuracy for the ground state energy, around $10^{-5}$ for VMC and $10^{-6}$ for GFMC in all regimes of parameters, including in the vicinity of the quantum phase transition. We used very small ranks ($\\sim 2-5$) of perceptrains, as opposed to multiples of thousand used in matrix product states.

We develop a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm that enables the estimation of an arbitrary observable expectation value in an eigenstate, given an initial state is supplied that has dominant overlap with the targeted eigenstate -- but may overlap with any other eigenstates. Our approach builds on, and is conceptually similar to purification-based error mitigation techniques; however, it achieves exponential suppression of algorithmic errors using only a single copy of the quantum state. The key innovation is that random time evolution is applied in the quantum computer to create an average mixed quantum state, which is then virtually purified with exponential efficacy. We prove rigorous performance guarantees and conclude that the complexity of our approach depends directly on the energy gap in the problem Hamiltonian, and is thus comparable to state-of-the-art hybrid techniques. We demonstrate in a broad range of numerical simulations the applicability of our framework in near-term and early fault-tolerant settings.

To this end, an important goal is to identify efficient quantum state preparation protocols that minimize the physical qubit number and circuit depth resources required to capture higher-dimensional quantum correlations. This work introduces a quantum circuit compression algorithm for Gaussian fermion states based on the multi-scale entanglement renormalization ansatz (MERA), which provides an exponential reduction in the circuit depth required to approximate highly-entangled ground-states relevant for quantum materials simulations. The algorithm, termed two-dimensional Gaussian MERA ($2d$ GMERA), extends MERA techniques to compress higher-dimensional Gaussian states. Through numerical simulations of the Haldane model on a honeycomb lattice, the method is shown to accurately capture area-law entangled states including topologically trivial insulators, Chern insulators, and critical Dirac semimetals. While Gaussian states alone are classically simulable, this approach establishes empirical upper bounds on quantum resources needed to prepare free fermion states that are adiabatically connected to correlated ground states, providing guidance for implementing these protocols on near-term quantum devices and offering a foundation for simulating more complex quantum materials. Finally, we develop a novel fermion-to-qubit encoding scheme, based on an expanding $2d$ topological order, that enables implementing fermionic rotations via qubit Pauli rotations with constant Pauli weight independent of system size.",

      "abstract": "Using the density matrix renormalization group method, we systematically investigate the evolution of the Luttinger integral in the one-dimensional generalized t-V model as a function of filling and interaction strength, identifying three representative phases. In the weak-coupling regime, the zero-frequency Green's function shows a branch-cut structure at the Fermi momentum, and the Luttinger integral accurately reflects the particle density. As the interaction increases, the spectral weight near the Fermi momentum is gradually suppressed. In the strong-coupling regime near half-filling, the singularity is progressively destroyed, accompanied by zeros in the real part of the Green's function. This leads to a non-Fermi-liquid metallic phase beyond the Luttinger liquid paradigm. While spectral weight remains at the original Fermi momentum, the singularity fades. Meanwhile, zeros with negligible spectral weight appear elsewhere, significantly affecting the integral. At half-filling, a single-particle gap opens, and the Green's function vanishes across momentum space, indicating the suppression of low-energy states, consistent with an insulating charge-density-wave phase. These results suggest that the breakdown of the Luttinger theorem arises from the interplay of interaction-driven excitation evolution and particle-hole symmetry breaking, leading to a continuous reconstruction of the generalized Fermi surface from topologically protected to correlation-driven.",

Namely, first we establish hardness in the following sense: Let $U=e^{-iHt}$ be an NH gate on $n$ qubits whose smallest and largest singular values differ by at least $2^{-\\text{poly}(n)}$. Together with any universal set of unitary gates, the ability to apply such a gate lets one efficiently emulate postselection. The resulting model decides every language in PostBQP; hence, under standard complexity conjectures, fully scalable NH quantum computers are unlikely to be engineered. Second, we establish upper bounds which show that conversely, any non-Hermitian evolution can be written as a unitary on a system-meter pair followed by postselecting the meter. This ``purification'' is compact -- it introduces only $O(\\delta^{2})$ Trotter error per time step $\\delta$ -- so any NH model whose purification lies in a strongly simulable unitary family (e.g., Clifford, matchgate, or low-bond-dimension tensor-network circuits) remains efficiently simulable.

We define a finite-dimensional \"bounding box\" called the hat-tensor, and a master function governing its RG flow. Iterating this function numerically, we establish convergence to the high-temperature fixed point for tensors lying within a quantifiable neighborhood. Our main theorem shows that tensors with deviations bounded by 0.02 in 63 orthogonal sectors flow to the fixed point. We also apply the method to specific models - the 2D Ising and XY models - obtaining explicit bounds on their high-temperature phase. This work brings the Tensor RG program closer towards a rigorous, computer-assisted construction of critical fixed points.",

      "abstract": "One of the signature observables for the electronic multichannel Kondo model is the impurity entropy, which was claimed to be found in $J_1$-$J_2$ Heisenberg chain with open boundary condition (OBC) and periodic boundary condition (PBC), respectively for the one-channel and two-channel case. However, it is not clear how to generalize OBC and PBC in Heisenberg chains to find the multichannel Kondo impurity entropy with more than two channels. In this paper, we demonstrate that the correct boundary condition for realizing multichannel Kondo physics in Heisenberg chains is the image impurity boundary condition (IIBC), which yields the expected impurity entropy, $\\ln[(\\sqrt{5}+1)/2]$ for the three-channel case and $\\ln\\sqrt{3}$ for the four-channel case. Moreover, the IIBC reduces to OBC for the one-channel case and to PBC for the two-channel case. With IIBC, the finite-size scaling of the impurity entropy and the total spin both match the finite-temperature correction in the electronic multichannel Kondo model. Additionally, we show that the XXZ anisotropy reduces the impurity entropy through a power law of the effective Luttinger liquid parameter.",

Using doped Clifford Weingarten calculus and a replica tensor network formalism, we derive exact results and perform large-scale simulations in regimes challenging for tensor network and Pauli-based methods. We begin by analyzing generalized stabilizer entropies, computable magic monotones in many-qudit systems, and identify a dynamical phase transition in the doping rate, marking the breakdown of classical simulability and the onset of Haar-random behavior. The critical behavior is governed by the qudit dimension and the magic content of the non-Clifford gate. Using the qudit $T$-gate as a benchmark, we show that higher-dimensional qudits converge faster to Haar-typical stabilizer entropies. For qutrits ($d=3$), analytical predictions match numerics on brickwork circuits, showing that locality plays a limited role in magic spreading. We also examine anticoncentration and entanglement growth, showing that $O(\\log N)$ non-Clifford gates suffice for approximating Haar expectation values to precision $\\varepsilon$, and relate antiflatness measures to stabilizer entropies in qutrit systems. Finally, we analyze out-of-time-order correlators and show that a finite density of non-Clifford gates is needed to induce chaos, with a sharp transition fixed by the local dimension, twice that of the magic transition. Altogether, these results establish a unified framework for diagnosing complexity in doped Clifford circuits and deepen our understanding of resource theories in multiqudit systems.",

      "abstract": "Understanding the computational complexity of quantum states is a central challenge in quantum many-body physics. In qubit systems, fermionic Gaussian states can be efficiently simulated on classical computers and hence can be employed as a natural baseline for evaluating quantum complexity. In this work, we develop a framework for quantifying fermionic magic resources, also referred to as fermionic non-Gaussianity, which constitutes an essential resource for universal quantum computation. We leverage the algebraic structure of the fermionic commutant to define the fermionic antiflatness (FAF)-an efficiently computable and experimentally accessible measure of non-Gaussianity, with a clear physical interpretation in terms of Majorana fermion correlation functions. Studying systems in equilibrium, we show that FAF detects phase transitions, reveals universal features of critical points, and uncovers special solvable points in many-body systems. Extending the analysis to out-of-equilibrium settings, we demonstrate that fermionic magic resources become more abundant in highly excited eigenstates of many-body systems. We further investigate the growth and saturation of FAF under ergodic many-body dynamics, highlighting the roles of conservation laws and locality in constraining the increase of non-Gaussianity during unitary evolution. This work provides a framework for probing quantum many-body complexity from the perspective of fermionic Gaussian states and opens up new directions for investigating fermionic magic resources in many-body systems. Our results establish fermionic non-Gaussianity, alongside entanglement and non-stabilizerness, as a resource relevant not only to foundational studies but also to experimental platforms aiming to achieve quantum advantage.",

A Shankar-Witten-type bosonization Lagrangian with disorder captures several features of the numerically obtained results for disordered two-leg ladders. Additionally, we propose a Lagrangian in which the fusion of two semions residing on different chains generates a fermion (instanton). We apply this Lagrangian within the framework of the pinned charge-density-wave model and compute the relevant Green's function using the bosonization method.

Current state-of-the-art (SOTA) algorithms are computationally expensive as they require extensive function evaluations, which is prohibitive for real-world applications. In addition, existing methods ignore valuable domain information inherent in real-world tensor data and lack transparency in their identified TN structures. To this end, we propose a novel TN-SS framework, termed the tnLLM, which incorporates domain information about the data and harnesses the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to directly predict suitable TN structures. The proposed framework involves a domain-aware prompting pipeline which instructs the LLM to infer suitable TN structures based on the real-world relationships between tensor modes. In this way, our approach is capable of not only iteratively optimizing the objective function, but also generating domain-aware explanations for the identified structures. Experimental results demonstrate that tnLLM achieves comparable TN-SS objective function values with much fewer function evaluations compared to SOTA algorithms. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the LLM-enabled domain information can be used to find good initializations in the search space for sampling-based SOTA methods to accelerate their convergence while preserving theoretical performance guarantees.",

One method that has gained attention for performing this evaluation on classical computers is tensor networks. Tensor networks not only reduce the computational cost required for simulations by using approximations but are also deeply connected to entanglement. Entanglement is one of the most important elements for the quantum advantages of quantum algorithms, but the direct relationship between quantum advantages and entanglement remains largely unexplored. Tensor networks are promising as a means to address this question. In this study, we focus on the entanglement in the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA). This study aims to investigate entanglement in QAOA by examining the relationship between the approximation rates of tensor networks and the performance of QAOA. Specifically, we actually perform tensor network simulations of QAOA on a classical computer and extend the study of the scaling relations presented in previous research. We have discovered that scaling relations hold even when entanglement entropy is used as the vertical axis. Furthermore, by analyzing the results of the numerical calculations, we propose a new function for the scaling relation. Additionally, we discovered interesting relationships regarding the behavior of entanglement in QAOA during our analysis.

By combining exact diagonalization and real-space renormalization group (RG) techniques, we attribute these features to fractionalized spinons and composite quasiparticles arising from one- and two-trimer excitations.

At the field-induced 1/3 magnetization plateau, single-spin-flip RIXS spectra evolves with the magnetic field to favor spin-polarized composite quasiparticles.

The method corrects a spurious initial state dependence found in the mean-field dynamics and describes the emergence of new time scales which are absent in the mean-field dynamics. Our formalism, based on density matrices, is applicable to other quantum optical systems with one-to-all interactions at finite temperatures.",

The circuit parameters are optimized to closely mimic imaginary time evolution, using only single- and two-qubit expectation values. This significantly reduces the measurement overhead by avoiding full energy evaluation. By updating the initial state based on results from last step iteratively, the algorithm quickly converges to the low-energy solutions. With a pre-sorting step that optimizes quantum gate ordering based on QUBO coefficients, the convergence is further improved. Our classical simulations achieve approximation ratios above 0.99 up to 150 qubits. Furthermore, the linear scaling of entanglement entropy with system size suggests that the circuit is challenging to simulate classically using tensor networks. We also demonstrate hardware runs on IBM's device for 40, 60, and 80 qubits, and obtain solutions compatible with that from simulated annealing.",

      "abstract": "In circuit-based quantum state preparation, qubit loss and coherent errors are circuit imperfections that imperil the formation of long-range entanglement beyond a certain threshold. The critical theory at the threshold is a continuous entanglement transition known to be described by a (2+0)-dimensional non-unitary conformal field theory which, for the two types of imperfections of certain circuits, is described by either percolation or Nishimori criticality, respectively. Here we study the threshold behavior when the two types of errors simultaneously occur and show that, when moving away from the Clifford-regime of projective stabilizer measurements, the percolation critical point becomes unstable and the critical theory flows to Nishimori universality. We track this critical renormalization group (RG) crossover flow by mapping out the entanglement phase diagrams, parametrized by the probability and strength of random weak measurements, of two dual protocols preparing surface code or GHZ-class cat states from a parent cluster state via constant-depth circuits. Extensive numerical simulations, using hybrid Gaussian fermion and tensor network / Monte Carlo sampling techniques on systems with more than a million qubits, demonstrate that an infinitesimal deviation from the Clifford regime leads to a sudden, strongly non-monotonic entanglement growth at the incipient non-unitary RG flow. We argue that spectra of scaling dimensions of both the percolation and Nishimori fixed points exhibit multifractality. For percolation, we provide the exact (non-quadratic) multifractal spectrum of exponents, while for the Nishimori fixed point we show high-precision numerical results for five leading exponents characterizing multifractality.",

      "abstract": "Highly-symmetric molecules often exhibit degenerate tight-binding states at the Fermi edge. This typically results in a magnetic ground state if small interactions are introduced in accordance with Hund's rule. In some cases, Hund's rule may be broken, which signals pair binding and goes hand-in-hand with an attractive pair-binding energy. We investigate pair binding and Hund's rule breaking for the Hubbard model on high-symmetry fullerenes C$_{20}$, C$_{28}$, C$_{40}$, and C$_{60}$ by using massive, large-scale density-matrix renormalization group calculations. We exploit the SU(2) spin symmetry, the U(1) charge symmetry, and optionally the Z(N) spatial rotation symmetry of the problem. For C$_{20}$, our results agree well with available exact-diagonalization data, but our approach is numerically much cheaper. We find a Mott transition at $U_c\\sim2.2t$, which is much smaller than the previously reported value of $U_c\\sim4.1t$ that was extrapolated from a few datapoints. We compute the pair-binding energy for arbitrary values of $U$ and observe that it remains overall repulsive. For larger fullerenes, we are not able to evaluate the pair binding energy with sufficient precision, but we can still investigate Hund's rule breaking. For C$_{28}$, we find that Hund's rule is fulfilled with a magnetic spin-2 ground state that transitions to a spin-1 state at $U_{c,1}\\sim5.4t$ before the eventual Mott transition to a spin singlet takes place at $U_{c,2}\\sim 11.6t$. For C$_{40}$, Hund's rule is broken in the singlet ground state, but is restored if the system is doped with one electron. Hund's rule is also broken for C$_{60}$, and the doping with two or three electrons results in a minimum-spin state. Our results support an electronic mechanism of superconductivity for C$_{60}$ lattices. We speculate that the high geometric frustration of small fullerenes is detrimental to pair binding.",

      "abstract": "Thermofield dynamics (TFD) is a powerful framework to account for thermal effects in a wavefunction setting, and has been extensively used in physics and quantum optics. TFD relies on a duplicated state space and creates a correlated two-mode thermal state via a Bogoliubov transformation acting on the vacuum state. However, a very useful variant of TFD uses the vacuum state as initial condition and transfers the Bogoliubov transformation into the propagator. This variant, referred to here as the inverse Bogoliubov transformation (iBT) variant, has recently been applied to vibronic coupling problems and coupled-oscillator Hamiltonians in a chemistry context, where the method is combined with efficient tensor network methods for high-dimensional quantum propagation. In the iBT/TFD representation, the mode expectation values are clearly defined and easy to calculate, but the thermalized reduced particle distributions such as the reduced 1-particle densities or Wigner distributions are highly non-trivial due to the Bogoliubov back-transformation of the original thermal TFD wavefunction. Here we derive formal expressions for the reduced 1-particle density matrix (1-RDM) that uses the correlations between the real and tilde modes encoded in the associated reduced 2-particle density matrix (2-RDM). We apply this formalism to define the 1-RDM and the Wigner distributions in the special case of a thermal harmonic oscillator. Moreover, we discuss several approximate schemes that can be extended to higher-dimensional distributions. These methods are demonstrated for the thermal reduced 1-particle density of an anharmonic oscillator.",

By monitoring the time evolution of the scattering processes, we are able to distinguish between two main regimes in the wake of the collision. The first is characterized by the delocalization of particles when the topological $\\Theta$-term is weak, while the second regime shows localized particles with a clear signature when the $\\Theta$-term is nontrivial. Furthermore, we show that by quenching to a small mass at the collision point, inelastic scattering occurs with a large production of matter reminiscent of quantum many-body scarring.

Beyond compression, we highlight the value of TNNs as a flexible class of architectures with distinctive scaling properties and increased interpretability. A central feature of TNNs is the presence of bond indices, which introduce new latent spaces not found in conventional networks. These internal representations may provide deeper insight into the evolution of features across layers, potentially advancing the goals of mechanistic interpretability. We conclude by outlining several key research directions aimed at overcoming the practical barriers to scaling and adopting TNNs in modern deep learning workflows.",

Next-generation reservoir computing simplifies this problem by employing nonlinear vector autoregression based on truncated Volterra series, thereby reducing hyperparameter complexity.

Tensor networks offer a promising solution to this issue by decomposing multidimensional arrays into low-dimensional structures, thus mitigating the curse of dimensionality.

      "abstract": "Accurately solving high-dimensional partial differential equations (PDEs) remains a central challenge in computational mathematics. Traditional numerical methods, while effective in low-dimensional settings or on coarse grids, often struggle to deliver the precision required in practical applications. Recent machine learning-based approaches offer flexibility but frequently fall short in terms of accuracy and reliability, particularly in industrial contexts. In this work, we explore a quantum-inspired method based on quantized tensor trains (QTT), enabling efficient and accurate solutions to PDEs in a variety of challenging scenarios. Through several representative examples, we demonstrate that the QTT approach can achieve logarithmic scaling in both memory and computational cost for linear and nonlinear PDEs. Additionally, we introduce a novel technique for data-driven learning within the quantum-inspired framework, combining the adaptability of neural networks with enhanced accuracy and reduced training time.",

      "abstract": "Pricing of exotic financial derivatives, such as Asian and multi-asset American basket options, poses significant challenges for standard numerical methods such as binomial trees or Monte Carlo methods. While the former often scales exponentially with the parameters of interest, the latter often requires expensive simulations to obtain sufficient statistical convergence. This work combines the binomial pricing method for options with tensor network techniques, specifically Matrix Product States (MPS), to overcome these challenges. Our proposed methods scale linearly with the parameters of interest and significantly reduce the computational complexity of pricing exotics compared to conventional methods. For Asian options, we present two methods: a tensor train cross approximation-based method for pricing, and a variational pricing method using MPS, which provides a stringent lower bound on option prices. For multi-asset American basket options, we combine the decoupled trees technique with the tensor train cross approximation to efficiently handle baskets of up to $m = 8$ correlated assets. All approaches scale linearly in the number of discretization steps $N$ for Asian options, and the number of assets $m$ for multi-asset options. Our numerical experiments underscore the high potential of tensor network methods as highly efficient simulation and optimization tools for financial engineering.",

We show that the truncated operator propagator (Ruelle-Pollicott resonances) is a powerful tool to that end, as well as to study prethermalization and discrete time crystals, including finding those phenomena at large gate duration, and can be used to calculate diffusion constant. We show that the effective energy is more stable than suggested by Trotter errors -- a manifestation of prethermalization -- while all other observables are not. Even such the most stable observable though deteriorates in the thermodynamic limit. Different than in classical systems with the strongest chaos, where the faithfulness time (the shadowing time) can be infinite, in quantum many-body chaotic systems it is finite. A corollary of our results is also that, opposite to previous claims, there is no Trotterization transition in non-integrable many-body quantum systems.",

For the computation of dynamical maps and process tensors, we employ a numerically exact method for non-Markovian open system dynamics based on matrix product operator influence functionals, that can be applied across broad parameter regimes. We find that, with access to single-intervention process tensors, one can generally predict quantum memory in the dynamics at low temperatures. Given instead only the dynamical map, we are still able to detect quantum memory in the case of resonant environments at short evolution times. Moreover, we confirm quantum memory in the stationary dynamical regime using process tensors with the correlated steady state of system and environment as initial condition.",

Additionally, we compute the corresponding weighted enumeration, where each independent set is weighted by the number of its vertices (i.e., the total sum of vertices over all independent sets). The approximations for larger $m, n$ are given as well. Our results have added thousands of new items to the OEIS sequences A089980 and A193580.

In this work, we present an efficient noise-resistant quantum data generation method that can be applied to various types of NISQ quantum processors, where the target quantum data belongs to a certain class and our proposal enables the generation of various quantum data belonging to the target class.

To show the feasibility and practicality of our scheme, we demonstrate the generations of the classes of GHZ-like states and W-like states with a success rate above 99%. Our MREA QDM can also be used to denoise multiple types of quantum data simultaneously. We show the success rate of denoising both GHZ-like and W-like states with a single qubit noise environment of noise level within 1/4 can approximate to be 100%, and with two other types of noise environment with noise level within 1/4 can be above 90%.

Here, we propose and analyze a distributed architecture for realizing the (6.6.6) color code. The architecture involves interconnecting patches of the color code housed in different quantum processing units (QPUs) via entangled pairs. To account for noisy interconnects, we model the qubits in the color code as being subject to a bit-flip noise channel, where the qubits on the boundary (seam) between patches experience elevated noise compared to those in the bulk. We investigate the error threshold of the distributed color code under such asymmetric noise conditions by employing two decoders: a tensor-network-based decoder and a recently introduced concatenated Minimum Weight Perfect Matching (MWPM) algorithm. Our simulations demonstrate that elevated noise on seam qubits leads to a slight reduction in threshold for the tensor-network decoder, whereas the concatenated MWPM decoder shows no significant change in the error threshold, underscoring its effectiveness under asymmetric noise conditions. Our findings thus highlight the robustness of color codes in distributed architectures and provide valuable insights into the practical realization of FTQC involving noisy interconnects between QPUs.",

Exploiting this structure, we develop a hybrid Tensor-Network/Monte-Carlo (TN-MC) algorithm that samples the wave function and evaluates expectation values of generic local operators with computational cost that scales only polynomially in time. The accurate contraction of the wave function amplitudes is a consequence of the favorable scaling with time of the generalised temporal entropies. We find that their real part either saturates or, at most, grows logarithmically with time, revealing new instances of continuous dynamical quantum phase transitions (DQPTs) which we characterize.

For the tensor network approach, we show that its complexity, quantified by entanglement, is governed by the interplay of two other types of quantum resources, coherence and magic. Crucially, which one has the predominant influence on entanglement is elucidated by what we term the time entanglement of $O$. As time entanglement increases, the dominant resource shifts from coherence to magic. Numerical experiments are conducted to support this claim. For the stabilizer formalism approach, we propose an operator stabilizer formalism to enable its application to arbitrary $O$, whose complexity always relies on magic. The operator stabilizer formalism is also powerful than the standard one for simulating some quantum circuits with special structures.

Quantum architecture search (QAS) automates this design process, with reinforcement learning (RL) emerging as a promising approach. Yet, RL-based QAS methods encounter significant scalability issues, as computational and training costs grow rapidly with the number of qubits, circuit depth, and noise, severely impacting performance. To address these challenges, we introduce $\\textit{TensorRL-QAS}$, a scalable framework that combines tensor network (TN) methods with RL for designing quantum circuits. By warm-starting the architecture search with a matrix product state approximation of the target solution, TensorRL-QAS effectively narrows the search space to physically meaningful circuits, accelerating convergence to the desired solution. Tested on several quantum chemistry problems of up to 12-qubit, TensorRL-QAS achieves up to a 10-fold reduction in CNOT count and circuit depth compared to baseline methods, while maintaining or surpassing chemical accuracy. It reduces function evaluations by up to 100-fold, accelerates training episodes by up to $98\\%$, and achieves up to $50\\%$ success probability for 10-qubit systems-far exceeding the $<1\\%$ rates of baseline approaches.

The ground state and excitation spectrum of the model are calculated by numerically exact tensor-network methods. We find that the photon number of the ground state is enhanced (suppressed) along the quantum phase transition line when the light-matter coupling is comparable to (much smaller than) the cavity frequency. We also show that the exciton peak in the optical conductivity and photon spectrum that exists without the cavity exhibits the vacuum Rabi splitting at resonance due to the light-matter interaction. This behavior is in contrast to the case without excitons, where the photon spectrum is merely broadened without splitting due to the lack of a sharp resonance.",

In this work, we propose a new wave-function ansatz in which matrix product states are augmented with the combination of Matchgates and Clifford circuits (dubbed MCA-MPS) to take advantage of the representing power of all of them. Moreover, the optimization of MCA-MPS can be efficiently implemented within the Density Matrix Renormalization Group method. Our benchmark results on one-dimensional hydrogen chain show that MCA-MPS can improve the accuracy of the ground-state calculation by several orders of magnitude over MPS with the same bond dimension. This new method provides us a useful approach to study quantum many-body systems. The MCA-MPS ansatz also expands our understanding of classically simulatable quantum many-body states.",

Empirical validation on MNIST classification demonstrates that photonic QT achieves an accuracy of $95.50\\% \\pm 0.84\\%$ using 3,292 parameters ($\\chi = 10$), compared to $96.89\\% \\pm 0.31\\%$ for classical baselines with 6,690 parameters.

In stage two, the infinite-lattice gate sequence is used as a starting point for a finite lattice where it remains optimal in the bulk. The prepared state requires optimization only at its boundary, within a healing length from lattice edges, and the gate sequence needs to be modified only within the causal cone of the boundary. We test the procedure in the 1D and 2D quantum Ising model near its quantum critical point employing, respectively, the matrix product state (MPS) and the pair-entangled projected state (PEPS).

This constitutes a generalization of the pure state projected ensemble in which measurements are assumed ideal and complete, and which has been shown to tend towards limiting pure state distributions depending only on symmetries of the system, thus representing a new kind of universality in quantum equilibration dubbed deep thermalization. We study the MSPE generated by solvable (1+1)d dual-unitary quantum circuit evolution, and identify the limiting mixed state distributions which emerge at late times depending on the size of the incomplete measurement, which we assume to be lossy, finding that they correspond to certain random density matrix ensembles known in the literature. We also derive the rate of the emergence of such universality. Furthermore, we investigate the quantum information properties of the states composing the ensemble, specifically their capacity to teleport quantum information between the ends of the system. The teleportation fidelity is upper bounded by the quantum conditional entropy, which we find exhibits a sharp transition from zero to maximal when the number of measurements lost matches of that the number of degrees of freedom to be teleported. Our results initiate the first investigation of deep thermalization for mixed state ensembles, which are relevant for present-day quantum simulation experiments wherein measurements are typically not perfect, and also amount to a physical and natural way of sampling from hitherto abstract random density matrix ensembles.",

In the case of the Born machine algorithm, we further identify a causality trap, where the trained MPS models resemble causal models that ignore the non-local correlations in the true distribution. We propose two complementary strategies to overcome the training failure -- one through optimization and one through initialization. First, we develop a natural gradient descent (NGD) method, which approximately simulates the gradient flow on tensor manifolds and significantly enhances training efficiency. Numerical experiments show that NGD avoids local minima in both Born machines and in general MPS tomography. Remarkably, we show that NGD with line search can converge to the global minimum in only a few iterations. Second, for the BM algorithm, we introduce a warm-start initialization based on the TTNS-Sketch algorithm.

However, certain special classes -- namely Clifford and matchgate circuits -- permit efficient computation. They provide invaluable tools for studying many-body physics, quantum chemistry, and quantum computation. While both play foundational roles across multiple disciplines, the origins of their tractability seem disparate, and their relationship remain unclear. A deeper understanding of such tractable classes could expand their scope and enable a wide range of new applications. In this work, we make progress toward the unified understanding of the Clifford and matchgate -- these two classes are, in fact, distinct special cases of a single underlying structure. Specifically, we introduce the 2D Quon language, which combines Majorana worldlines with their underlying spacetime topology to diagrammatically represent quantum processes and tensor networks. In full generality, the 2D Quon language is universal -- capable of representing arbitrary quantum states, dynamics, or tensor networks -- yet they become especially powerful in describing Clifford and matchgate classes. Each class can be efficiently characterized in a visually recognizable manner using the Quon framework. This capability naturally gives rise to several families of efficiently computable tensor networks introduced in this work: punctured matchgates, hybrid Clifford-matchgate-MPS, and ansatze generated from factories of tractable networks. All of these exhibit high non-Cliffordness, high non-matchgateness, and large bipartite entanglement entropy. We discuss a range of applications of our approach, from recovering well-known results such as the Kramers-Wannier duality and the star-triangle relation of the Ising model, to enabling variational optimization with novel ansatz states.",

Most HPC tensor network packages tackle this issue with a procedure called circuit slicing, which distributes the entire network onto multiple ranks, recombining it back when necessary. In this study, we present a novel alternative approach, where individual tensors are both broadcast and scattered to harness multiple levels of parallelism. The technique is abstracted behind a fixed distribution pattern, and actualised in a new portable tensor network library, QTNH, built on top of MPI and ScaLAPACK. We showcase its capabilities on ARCHER2, by emulating two well-known algorithms - the Quantum Fourier Transform and Random Circuit Sampling. This is accomplished by leveraging the implemented operations to realise various contraction strategies, including a unique distributed MPS tensor factorisation approach. We thus demonstrate that our library can be used to advance the accuracy of quantum emulation, while offering a simple and flexible interface to tensor distribution.",

TTNOpt provides efficient and powerful TTN computations by locally optimizing the network structure, guided by the entanglement pattern of the target tensors. For quantum spin systems, TTNOpt searches for the ground state of Hamiltonians with bilinear spin interactions and magnetic fields, and computes physical properties of these states, including the variational energy, bipartite entanglement entropy (EE), single-site expectation values, and two-site correlation functions. Additionally, TTNOpt can target the lowest-energy state within a specified subspace, provided that the Hamiltonian conserves total magnetization. For high-dimensional data analysis, TTNOpt factorizes complex tensors into TTN states that maximize fidelity to the original tensors by optimizing the tensors and the network. When a TTN is provided as input, TTNOpt reconstructs the network based on the EE without referencing the fidelity of the original state. We present three demonstrations of TTNOpt: (1) Ground-state search for the hierarchical chain model with a system size of $256$. The entanglement patterns of the ground state manifest themselves in a tree structure, and TTNOpt successfully identifies the tree. (2) Factorization of a quantic tensor of the $2^{24}$ dimensions representing a three-variable function where each variant has a weak bit-wise correlation.

      "abstract": "Accurate prediction of mRNA secondary structure is critical for understanding gene expression, translation efficiency, and advancing mRNA-based therapeutics. However, the combinatorial complexity of possible foldings, especially in long sequences, poses significant computational challenges for classical algorithms. In this work, we propose a scalable, quantum-centric optimization framework that integrates quantum sampling with classical post-processing to tackle this problem. Building on a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) formulation of the mRNA folding task, we develop two complementary workflows: a Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR)-based variational quantum algorithm enhanced with gauge transformations and local search, and an Instantaneous Quantum Polynomial (IQP) circuit-based scheme where training is done classically and sampling is delegated to quantum hardware. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these approaches using IBM quantum processors, solving problem instances with up to 156 qubits and circuits containing up to 950 nonlocal gates, corresponding to mRNA sequences of up to 60 nucleotides. Additionally, we validate scalability of the CVaR algorithm on a tensor network simulator, reaching up to 354 qubits in noiseless settings. These results demonstrate the growing practical capabilities of hybrid quantum-classical methods for tackling large-scale biological optimization problems.",

      "abstract": "We study causality and criticality in a one-dimensional fractional multiscale transverse-field Ising model, where fractional derivatives generate long range interactions beyond the scope of standard power laws. Such fractional responses are common in classical systems including the anomalous stress-strain behaviour of viscoelastic polymers, L\\'evy-like contaminant transport in heterogeneous porous media, and the non-Debye dielectric relaxation of glassy dielectrics. Furthermore, these unique interactions can be implemented in current quantum information architectures, with intriguing consequences for the many-body dynamics. Using a truncated Jordan-Wigner approach, we show that in the long wavelength limit of the mean field, the dynamical critical exponent is set by the fractional order q as $z=q/2$. To probe genuine many-body dynamics, we apply matrix-product-state simulations with the time-dependent variational principle adapted to nonlocal couplings. Tracking the entanglement-entropy light cone and performing finite-size scaling of the many-body gap for $0<q<2.5$, we confirm a continuously tunable exponent $z(q)$: for $q<2$ the entanglement front broadens with a sublinear light cone; for $2<q<2.5$ we observe a faint superlinear cone indicative of $z<1$; and for $q \\gtrsim 2.5$ the system reverts to the ballistic nearest-neighbour regime with $z=1$. The correspondence between quantum entanglement fronts that spread as $t^{1/z}$ and classical L\\'evy flights whose mean-square displacement grows as $t^{2/q}$ provides a direct physical link between fractional interactions and L\\'evy statistics. Fractional derivatives therefore offer a unified framework in which short-range, power-law, and frustrated long-range interactions emerge as limiting cases, enabling controlled exploration of nonlocal causality bounds and exotic entanglement dynamics within current quantum information platforms.",

This method extends the MeLoCoToN algorithm for inversion and optimization problems with continuous variables, by using Field Tensor Networks. The fundamentals of the method are the conversion of the problem of minimization of $N$ continuous variables into a problem of maximization of a dependent functional of a single variable. It can also be adapted to determine other properties, such as the zeros of any function. For this purpose, we use an extension of the imaginary time evolution, the new method of continuous signals, and partial or total integration, depending on the case. In addition, we show a direct way to recover both the tensor networks and the MeLoCoToN from this formalism. We show some examples of application, such as the Riemann hypothesis resolution. We provide an explicit integral equation that gives the solution of the Riemann hypothesis, being that if it results in a zero value, it is correct; otherwise, it is wrong. This algorithm requires no deep mathematical knowledge and is based on simple mathematical properties.",

Here we present an extensive study of ground state and excitations of ferromagnetic anisotropic-exchange Kitaev-Heisenberg model on a triangular lattice using order-by-disorder and augmented spin-wave theory calculations. It is shown that while bond-dependent terms of the model do not affect the ground state classically, quantum fluctuations select preferred magnetization direction of the ferromagnetic state and significantly alter classical phase diagram. Anisotropic terms of the magnetic Hamiltonian also give rise to magnon-magnon interactions that lead to spontaneous decay and spectral renormalization, which we illustrate using non-linear spin-wave theory.",

      "abstract": "Quantum many-body scars are atypical energy eigenstates of chaotic quantum many-body systems that prevent certain special non-equilibrium initial conditions from thermalizing. We point out that quantum many-body scars exist for any nearest-neighbor spin-$S$ XYZ quantum spin chain, and arise in the form of an infinite family of highly excited yet nonentangled product-state eigenstates, which define periodic textures in spin space. This set of scars, discovered originally by Granovskii and Zhedanov in 1985, encompasses both the experimentally relevant 'spin helices' for XXZ chains and more complicated helix-like states constructed from Jacobi elliptic functions for generic XYZ chains. An appealing feature of Granovskii-Zhedanov scars is that they are well-defined in the semiclassical limit $S \\to \\infty$, which allows for a systematic and analytical treatment of their dynamical instability to perturbations of the Hamiltonian. Using time-dependent spin-wave theory, we predict that upon perturbing along certain directions in Hamiltonian space, Granovskii-Zhedanov scars exhibit a dramatic asymmetry in their decay: depending on the sign of the perturbation, the decrease of their contrast is either slow and linear, or fast and exponential in time. This asymmetry can be traced to the absence (presence) of imaginarity in the spectrum of the Bogoliubov Hamiltonian governing quantum fluctuations about the scar, which corresponds to the absence (presence) of a non-zero Lyapunov exponent for the limiting classical trajectory. Numerical simulations using matrix product states (MPS) and infinite time-evolving block decimation (iTEBD) confirm that our prediction remains valid even far from the semiclassical limit. Our findings challenge existing theories of how quantum-many body scars relax.",

In the unfrustrated regime ($J_1>2J_2$), the model reproduces the standard clock model phenomenology: a low-temperature $\\mathbb{Z}_q$-broken ferromagnet, an intermediate XY-like critical quasi-long-range-ordered (QLRO) phase with emergent $U(1)$ symmetry, and a high-temperature paramagnet. For $J_1<2J_2$, frustration stabilizes five distinct regimes: the disordered paramagnet, a stripe-ordered phase breaking $\\mathbb{Z}_q\\times\\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry, two $\\mathbb{Z}_2$-broken nematic phases (one with and one without QLRO), and an exotic stripe phase with emergent discrete $\\mathbb{Z}_q$ spin degrees of freedom prohibited in the microscopic Hamiltonian. Remarkably, this seemingly forbidden $\\mathbb{Z}_q$ order emerges via a relevant operator in the infrared long-wavelength limit, rather than from an irrelevant perturbation, highlighting a non-standard route to emergence. Using large-scale corner transfer matrix renormalization group calculations, complemented by classical Monte Carlo simulations, we map the complete phase diagram and identify Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless, Ising, first-order, and unconventional Landau-incompatible transitions between different phases. Finally, we propose an effective field-theoretic framework that encompasses these emergent orders and their interwoven transitions.",

We turn the path integral into a circuit by expressing it as a spacetime $ZX$ tensor network, and then traversing it in some chosen time direction.

      "abstract": "Quantum machine learning (QML) is an emerging field that investigates the capabilities of quantum computers for learning tasks. While QML models can theoretically offer advantages such as exponential speed-ups, challenges in data loading and the ability to scale to relevant problem sizes have prevented demonstrations of such advantages on practical problems. In particular, the encoding of arbitrary classical data into quantum states usually comes at a high computational cost, either in terms of qubits or gate count. However, real-world data typically exhibits some inherent structure (such as image data) which can be leveraged to load them with a much smaller cost on a quantum computer. This work further develops an efficient algorithm for finding low-depth quantum circuits to load classical image data as quantum states. To evaluate its effectiveness, we conduct systematic studies on the MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, and Imagenette datasets. The corresponding circuits for loading the full large-scale datasets are available publicly as PennyLane datasets and can be used by the community for their own benchmarks. We further analyze the performance of various quantum classifiers, such as quantum kernel methods, parameterized quantum circuits, and tensor-network classifiers, and we compare them to convolutional neural networks. In particular, we focus on the performance of the quantum classifiers as we introduce nonlinear functions of the input state, e.g., by letting the circuit parameters depend on the input state.",

Unlike random masking approaches, HMAE employs a physics-informed strategy based on quantum information theory to selectively mask Hamiltonian terms based on their physical significance. Experiments on 12,500 quantum Hamiltonians (60% real-world, 40% synthetic) demonstrate that HMAE achieves 85.3% $\\pm$ 1.5% accuracy in phase classification and 0.15 $\\pm$ 0.02 eV MAE in ground state energy prediction with merely 10 labeled examples - a statistically significant improvement (p < 0.01) over classical graph neural networks (78.1% $\\pm$ 2.1%) and quantum neural networks (76.8% $\\pm$ 2.3%). Our method's primary advantage is exceptional sample efficiency - reducing required labeled examples by 3-5x compared to baseline methods - though we emphasize that ground truth values for fine-tuning and evaluation still require exact diagonalization or tensor networks. We explicitly acknowledge that our current approach is limited to small quantum systems (specifically limited to 12 qubits during training, with limited extension to 16-20 qubits in testing) and that, while promising within this regime, this size restriction prevents immediate application to larger systems of practical interest in materials science and quantum chemistry.",

BMPs are analogous to the Tensor-Trains (TT) and Matrix Product States (MPS) used, respectively, in applied mathematics and in quantum many-body physics to accelerate computations that are usually inaccessible by more traditional approaches. BMPs turn out to be closely related to Binary Decision Diagrams (BDDs), a powerful compressed representation of Boolean functions invented in the late 80s by Bryant that has found a broad range of applications in many areas of computer science and engineering. We present a direct and natural translation of BMPs into Binary Decision Diagrams (BDDs), and derive an elementary set of operations used to manipulate and combine BMPs that are analogous to those introduced by Bryant for BDDs. Both BDDs and BMPs are practical tools when the complexity of these representations, as measured by the maximum bond dimension of a BMP (or the accumulated bond dimension across the BMP matrix train) and the number of nodes of a BDD, remains polynomial in the number of bits, $n$. In both cases, controlling the complexity hinges on optimizing the order of the Boolean variables. BMPs offer the advantage that their construction and manipulation rely on simple linear algebra -- a compelling feature that can facilitate the development of open-source libraries that are both more flexible and easier to use than those currently available for BDDs. An initial implementation of a BMP library is available on GitHub, with the expectation that the close conceptual connection to TT and MPS techniques will motivate further development of BMP methods by researchers in these fields, potentially enabling novel applications to classical and quantum computing.",

In the symmetry-broken phases, one of the three Majorana excitations remains gapless, while the other two acquire a band gap.

      "abstract": "A topological pump on an $N\\textrm{-}$leg spin ladder is discussed by introducing spatial clusterization whose adiabatic limit is a set of $2N\\textrm{-}$site staircase clusters. We set a pump path in the parameter space that connects two different symmetry protected topological phases. By introducing a symmetry breaking staggered magnetic field, the system is always gapped during the pump. In the topological pump {thus obtained}, the bulk Chern number is given by the number of the critical points enclosed by the pump path. Plateau transitions characterized by the Chern number are demonstrated associated with deformation of the pump path. We find that there are $N$ critical points enclosed by the pump path for the $N\\textrm{-}$leg ladder. The ground state phase diagram without symmetry breaking terms is numerically investigated by using the quantized Berry phase. We also discuss the physical picture of edge states in the diagonal boundary, and numerically demonstrate the bulk-edge correspondence for $N=2,3$ cases.",

In this work, we demonstrate that, by relaxing the finite-range condition to allow for exponentially decaying hoppings, one can build gapped frustration-free systems that realize Chern insulators as well as quasi-degenerate ground states with finite-size splittings. Moreover, by permitting power-law decaying hoppings, we also construct a gapless band metal whose finite-size gap scales inversely with the system size $L$. These findings serve as an important step toward clarifying the general properties of frustration-free systems and those represented by tensor network states.",

We show that $z(a)$ is a throat, and that it is contained in every other throat. This implies that $z(a)$ is unique; that it is contained in the generalized entanglement wedge; and that it reduces to the AdS prescription as a special case. The zigzag explicitly constructs a preferred Cauchy slice that renders the simple wedge accessible from $a$; thus it adds a novel structure even in AdS.

The string order parameter is obtained by contracting the truncated symmetry operator with charge decoration operators, which are determined by the NISPT action tensors.

Here we propose a contraction scheme for $C_{4v}$-symmetric tensor networks based on combining the corner transfer matrix renormalization group (CTMRG) with QR-decompositions which are substantially faster -- especially on GPUs.

The method yields a series of quantum master equations for all core tensors in the TTN that efficiently and accurately capture the open quantum dynamics for non-Markovian environments to all orders in the system-bath interaction. These master equations are constructed based on the time-dependent Dirac--Frenkel variational principle which isolates the optimal dynamics for the core tensors given the TTN ansatz. The dynamics converges to the HEOM when increasing the rank of the core tensors, a limit in which the TTN ansatz becomes exact. We introduce TENSO, Tensor Equations for Non-Markovian Structured Open systems, as a general-purpose Python code to propagate the TTN-HEOM dynamics. We implement three general propagators for the coupled master equations: Two fixed-rank methods that require a constant memory footprint during the dynamics, and one adaptive-rank method with variable memory footprint controlled by the target level of computational error. We exemplify the utility of these methods by simulating a two-level system coupled to a structured bath containing one Drude--Lorentz component and eight Brownian oscillators, which is beyond what can presently be computed using the standard HEOM. Our results show that the TTN-HEOM is capable to simulate both dephasing and relaxation dynamics of driven quantum system interacting with structured baths, even those of chemical complexity, with affordable computational cost.",

A quantum Monte-Carlo study of an extended Bose-Hubbard ladder has recently been used to identify an exotic phase with hidden order, where superfluid correlations coexist with string order, dubbed a Haldane superfluid (HSF). However, finite-size methods can struggle to uniquely determine the boundaries of quasi-long-range ordered states with nonlocal, e.g. string-like, correlations. In the present Letter, we revisit the HSF scenario using tensor network algorithms specialized for finite/infinite (quasi-)1D systems, \\textit{i.e.} the well-governed finite-size density matrix renormalization group (DMRG), and the state-of-the-art infinite-size variational uniform matrix product state (VUMPS) methods. While DMRG results extrapolated to the thermodynamic limit are compatible with a putative HSF, the results from the VUMPS calculations provide sharper phase boundaries that leave no room for such a topological superfluid. Our results demonstrate the crucial advantage of the VUMPS in characterizing topological and critical interacting phases providing the precise phase boundaries.",

Employing density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations, we explore the effects of spin-dependent tunneling amplitudes on these systems. Specifically, we analyze how bound states of three fermions (trimers) impact Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) superconducting correlations at commensurate charge carrier densities, where $2n_{\\uparrow} = n_{\\downarrow}$. In one-dimensional (1D) systems, trimer formation is known to suppress FFLO correlations exponentially. Our results demonstrate that this suppression persists on ladder lattices of small width, effectively mirroring the 1D behavior. However, we find a striking departure from the 1D regime as the ladder width increases. On ladders with a width of four legs, the influence of trimers on superconducting correlations becomes negligible, suggesting that wider ladder systems provide a distinct environment where FFLO-like pairing remains robust even in the presence of trimer states. These findings underscore the dimensional crossover in Hubbard systems and shed light on the mechanisms governing superconductivity and bound-state formation in strongly correlated fermionic systems.

In addition to its simple implementation, recent studies have revealed that its error and cost can be reduced if the initial state is closed in the low-energy subspace. However, the improvement by the low-energy property rapidly vanishes as the Trotter order grows in the previous studies, and thus, it is mysterious whether there exists genuine advantage of low-energy initial states. In this Letter, we resolve this problem by proving the optimal error bound and cost of Trotterization for low-energy initial states. For generic local Hamiltonians composed of positive-semidefinite terms, we show that the Trotter error is at most linear in the initial state energy $\\Delta$ and polylogarithmic in the system size $N$. As a result, the computational cost becomes substantially small for low-energy states with $\\Delta \\in o(Ng)$ compared to the one for arbitrary initial states, where $g$ denotes the energy per site and $Ng$ means the whole-system energy. Our error bound and cost of Trotterization achieve the theoretically-best scaling in the initial state energy $\\Delta$. In addition, they can be partially extended to weakly-correlated initial states having low-energy expectation values, which are not necessarily closed in the low-energy subspace. Our results will pave the way for fast and accurate simulation of low-energy states, which are one central targets in condensed matter physics and quantum chemistry.",

We show that this technique allows us to extract the Hamiltonian parameters of a quantum magnet from the differential conductance, including the substrate-induced spatial variation of the exchange couplings. Our methodology leverages a machine learning algorithm trained on exact quantum many-body simulations with tensor networks of finite quantum magnets, leading to a methodology that predicts the Hamiltonian parameters of CoPC quantum magnets of arbitrary size.

We demonstrate that the spread of magic follows the light-cone structure dictated by the system's dynamics, with distinct behaviors emerging in the easy-plane ($\\Delta < 1$) and easy-axis ($\\Delta > 1$) regimes. For $\\Delta < 1$, magic generation is primarily governed by single-particle dynamics, while for $\\Delta > 1$, doublon propagation dominates, resulting in a significantly slower growth of $M_2$. Furthermore, the magic exhibits logarithmic growth in time for both one and two-particle dynamics. Additionally, by examining the Pauli spectrum, we show that the statistical distribution of level spacings exhibits Poissonian behavior, independent of interaction strength or particle number.

We map such circuits to a fermionic tensor network and introduce a novel decomposition of non-Matchgate gates into a Gaussian fermionic tensor and a residual quartic term, inspired by interacting fermionic systems. The quartic term is independent of the specific gate, which allows us to precompute intermediate results independently of the exact circuit structure and leads to significant speedups when compared to other methods. Our decomposition suggests a natural perturbative expansion which can be turned into an algorithm to compute measurement outcomes and observables to finite accuracy when truncating at some order of the expansion. For particle number conserving gates, our decomposition features a unique truncation cutoff reducing the computational effort for high precision calculations. Our algorithm significantly lowers resource requirements for simulating parity-preserving circuits while retaining high accuracy, making it suitable for simulations of interacting systems in quantum chemistry and material science. Lastly, we discuss how our algorithm compares to other classical simulation methods for fermionic quantum systems.",

Here, we provide efficient witnesses of magic based on the stabilizer R\\'enyi entropy which robustly indicate the presence of magic and quantitatively estimate magic monotones. We also design efficient property testing algorithms to reliably distinguish states with high and low magic, assuming the entropy is bounded. We apply our methods to certify the number of noisy T-gates under a wide class of noise models. Additionally, using the IonQ quantum computer, we experimentally verify the magic of noisy random quantum circuits. Surprisingly, we find that magic is highly robust, persisting even under exponentially strong noise. Our witnesses can also be efficiently computed for matrix product states, revealing that subsystems of many-body quantum states can contain extensive magic despite entanglement. Finally, our work also has direct implications for cryptography and pseudomagic: To mimic high magic states with as little magic as possible, one requires an extensive amount of entropy. This implies that entropy is a necessary resource to hide magic from eavesdroppers. Our work uncovers powerful tools to verify and study the complexity of noisy quantum systems.",

In this work, we consider generalized symmetries including non-invertible ones realized microscopically as matrix product operators (MPOs), and study the physical implications of their quantum anomaly on the MPDO RFPs. We prove that MPDOs with strong anomalous MPO symmetries cannot be prepared from a normal matrix product state in the trivial phase via a translationally invariant finite-depth local quantum channel. We explicitly construct a general class of zero-correlation-length MPDO RFPs that exhibit strong anomalous MPO symmetries, and these MPDO RFPs form a distinct class from those that can be efficiently prepared as a consequence of quantum anomaly. Nonetheless, we further prove that all the constructed MPDO RFPs can be prepared from product states by finite-depth quantum circuit with measurements and feedforward.",

      "abstract": "Quantum computing offers the potential for computational abilities that can go beyond classical machines. However, they are still limited by several challenges such as noise, decoherence, and gate errors. As a result, efficient classical simulation of quantum circuits is vital not only for validating and benchmarking quantum hardware but also for gaining deeper insights into the behavior of quantum algorithms. A promising framework for classical simulation is provided by tensor networks. Recently, the Density-Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) algorithm was developed for simulating quantum circuits using matrix product states (MPS). Although MPS is efficient for representing quantum states with one-dimensional correlation structures, the fixed linear geometry restricts the expressive power of the MPS. In this work, we extend the DMRG algorithm for simulating quantum circuits to tree tensor networks (TTNs). The framework employs a variational compression scheme that optimizes the TTN to approximate the evolved quantum state. To benchmark the method, we simulate random circuits and the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) with various two-qubit gate connectivities. For the random circuits, we devise tree-like gate layouts that are suitable for TTN and show that TTN requires less memory than MPS for the simulations. For the QAOA circuits, a naive TTN construction that exploits graph structure significantly improves the simulation fidelities. Our findings show that the DMRG algorithm with TTNs provides a promising framework for simulating quantum circuits, particularly when gate connectivities exhibit clustering or a hierarchical structure.",

In the two-species case, we identify a parameter regime where some sectors relax in finite time while others exhibit metastable relaxation dynamics, revealing the coexistence of fast and slow dynamics and strong particle sequence sector dependence.

In the fully screened Kondo phase, realized at lower anisotropies, the entangled region surrounding the magnetic impurity mimics the Kondo screening cloud, although its length does not follow the conventional behavior. In contrast, beyond the transition, the system enters a non-Landau Fermi liquid phase with a markedly different entanglement structure: as the impurity is quenched and disentangled from the rest of the system due to the breakdown of the Kondo effect, the two conduction channels coupled only through the impurity develop a significant degree of entanglement with one another.

      "abstract": "In quantum information theory, maximally entangled states, specifically locally maximally entangled (LME) states, are essential for quantum protocols. While many focus on bipartite entanglement, applications such as quantum error correction and multiparty secret sharing rely on multipartite entanglement. These LME states naturally appear in the invariant subspaces of tensor products of irreducible representations of the symmetric group $S_n$, called Kronecker subspaces, whose dimensions are the Kronecker coefficients. A Kronecker subspace is a space of multipartite LME states that entangle high-dimensional Hilbert spaces. Although these states can be derived from Clebsch-Gordan coefficients of $S_n$, known methods are inefficient even for small $n$. A quantum-information-based alternative comes from entanglement concentration protocols, where Kronecker subspaces arise in the isotypic decomposition of multiple copies of entangled states. Closed forms have been found for the multiqubit $W$-class states, but not in general. This thesis extends that approach to any multiqubit system. We first propose a graphical construction called W-state Stitching, where multiqubit entangled states are represented as tensor networks built from $W$ states. By analyzing the isotypic decomposition of copies of these graph states, corresponding graph Kronecker states can be constructed. In particular, graph states of generic multiqubit systems can generate any Kronecker subspace. We explicitly construct bases for three- and four-qubit systems and show that the W-stitching technique also serves as a valuable tool for multiqubit entanglement classification. These results may open new directions in multipartite entanglement resource theories, with bipartite and tripartite $W$ states as foundational elements, and asymptotic analysis based on Kronecker states.",

Without resorting to the replica trick, we demonstrate that mixed-state SSPT order remains remarkably robust up to the maximal decoherence rate when noise respects strong subsystem symmetry. Furthermore, we propose that the mixed-state SSPT order can be detected by a constant correction to the area-law scaling of entanglement negativity, termed spurious topological entanglement negativity.

In recent years, various deep learning methods have been explored for edge detection tasks resulting in a significant performance improvement compared to conventional computer vision algorithms. In neural networks, edge detection tasks require considerably large receptive fields to provide satisfactory performance. In a typical convolutional operation, such a large receptive field can be achieved by utilizing a significant number of consecutive layers, which yields deep network structures. Recently, a Multi-scale Tensorial Summation (MTS) factorization operator was presented, which can achieve very large receptive fields even from the initial layers. In this paper, we propose a novel MTS Dimensional Reduction (MTS-DR) module guided neural network, MTS-DR-Net, for the edge detection task. The MTS-DR-Net uses MTS layers, and corresponding MTS-DR blocks as a new backbone to remove redundant information initially. Such a dimensional reduction module enables the neural network to focus specifically on relevant information (i.e., necessary subspaces). Finally, a weight U-shaped refinement module follows MTS-DR blocks in the MTS-DR-Net. We conducted extensive experiments on two benchmark edge detection datasets: BSDS500 and BIPEDv2 to verify the effectiveness of our model. The implementation of the proposed MTS-DR-Net can be found at https://github.com/LeiXuAI/MTS-DR-Net.git.",

In the strong-coupling regime at half filling, we derive effective spin Hamiltonians for the kinetic exchange featuring Kitaev, Heisenberg, off-diagonal exchange ($\\Gamma$-couplings), as well as tunable Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions. We identify specific configurations that generate both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic Kitaev couplings with various perturbations of relevance to Kitaev materials, providing a tunable platform that can explore how quantum spin liquids emerge from itinerant fermion systems. We analyze the Fermi-liquid and Mott-insulating phases, highlighting a correspondence between Dirac and Majorana quasi-particles, with possible phase transitions thereof. In an extreme anisotropic limit, we show that the model reduces to an inter-layer ribbon in a quasi-1D ladder, allowing for a numerical study of the correlated ground state using matrix product states. We find a transition from a symmetry-protected topological insulator to a Kitaev-like regime characterized by nonlocal string order.

      "abstract": "Tree tensor networks (TTNs) provide a compact and structured representation of high-dimensional data, making them valuable in various areas of computational mathematics and physics. In this paper, we present a rigorous mathematical framework for expressing high-order derivatives of functional TTNs, both with or without constraints. Our framework decomposes the total derivative of a given TTN into a summation of TTNs, each corresponding to the partial derivatives of the original TTN. Using this decomposition, we derive the Taylor expansion of vector-valued functions subject to ordinary differential equation constraints or algebraic constraints imposed by Runge--Kutta (RK) methods. As a concrete application, we employ this framework to construct order conditions for RK methods. Due to the intrinsic tensor properties of partial derivatives and the separable tensor structure in RK methods, the Taylor expansion of numerical solutions can be obtained in a manner analogous to that of exact solutions using tensor operators. This enables the order conditions of RK methods to be established by directly comparing the Taylor expansions of the exact and numerical solutions, eliminating the need for mathematical induction. For a given function $\\vector{f}$, we derive sharper order conditions that go beyond the classical ones, enabling the identification of situations where a standard RK scheme of order {\\it p} achieves unexpectedly higher convergence order for the particular function. These results establish new connections between tensor network theory and classical numerical methods, potentially opening new avenues for both analytical exploration and practical computation.",

While this is straightforward for convex objective functions, higher-order formulations pose challenges due to their inherent non-convexity. In this work, we propose branch-and-bound digitized counterdiabatic quantum optimization (BB-DCQO), a quantum algorithm that addresses the relaxation difficulties in higher-order unconstrained binary optimization (HUBO) problems. By employing bias fields as approximate solutions to the relaxed problem, we iteratively enhance the quality of the results compared to the bare bias-field digitized counterdiabatic quantum optimization (BF-DCQO) algorithm. We refer to this enhanced method as BBB-DCQO. In order to benchmark it against simulated annealing (SA), we apply it on sparse HUBO instances with up to $156$ qubits using tensor network simulations. To explore regimes that are less tractable for classical simulations, we experimentally apply BBB-DCQO to denser problems using up to 100 qubits on IBM quantum hardware. We compare our results with SA and a greedy-tuned quantum annealing baseline. In both simulations and experiments, BBB-DCQO consistently achieved higher-quality solutions with significantly reduced computational overhead, showcasing the effectiveness of integrating counterdiabatic quantum methods into branch-and-bound to address hard non-convex optimization tasks.",

      "abstract": "Describing nonequilibrium quantum dynamics remains a significant computational challenge due to the growth of spatial entanglement. The tensor network influence functional (TN-IF) approach mitigates this problem for computing the time evolution of local observables by encoding the subsystem's influence functional path integral as a matrix product state (MPS), thereby shifting the resource governing computational cost from spatial entanglement to temporal entanglement. We extend the applicability of the TN-IF method to two-dimensional lattices by demonstrating its construction on tree lattices and proposing a belief propagation (BP) algorithm for the TN-IF, termed influence functional BP (IF-BP), to simulate local observable dynamics on arbitrary graphs. Even though the BP algorithm introduces uncontrolled approximation errors on arbitrary graphs, it provides an accurate description for locally tree-like lattices. Numerical simulations of the kicked Ising model on a heavy-hex lattice, motivated by a recent quantum experiment, highlight the effectiveness of the IF-BP method, which demonstrates superior performance in capturing long-time dynamics where traditional tensor network state-based methods struggle. Our results further reveal that the temporal entanglement entropy (TEE) only grows logarithmically with time for this model, resulting in a polynomial computational cost for the whole method. We further construct a cluster expansion of IF-BP to introduce loop correlations beyond the BP approximation, providing a systematic correction to the IF-BP estimate. We demonstrate the power of the cluster expansion of the IF-BP in simulating the quantum quench dynamics of the 2D transverse field Ising model, obtaining numerical results that improve on the state-of-the-art.",

This is a Type $I$ von Neumann algebra, since it is the algebra of the Rindler wedge in the Rindler vacuum state. Subalgebras of finite regions are Type $III_1$. The argument uses the elegant results of Moore and of Alexandrov, Kazakov and Kostov. This model is well known to be integrable and have no black hole excitations. We have speculated that adding an interaction invisible in perturbation theory to a large finite number, $M$, of copies of the model, produces a non-integrable model with meta-stable excitations having all of the properties of linear dilaton black holes. The algebra of fields is the tensor product of $M$ copies of the $c = 1$ model's algebra, whether or not we add the non-integrable interaction. We argue that the infinite dimensional $c = 1$ algebras are analogous to those of the boundary field theory in AdS/CFT, even though they appear to encode bulk causal structure. An IR cutoff on the boundary renders them finite and causal structure must be formulated in terms of an analog of the Tensor Network Renormalization Group. This is a time dependent Hamiltonian flow, embedding smaller Hilbert spaces into larger ones. It is the analog of one sided modular inclusion in quantum field theory.",

While these TTN image classifiers already show excellent performance on classical hardware, embedding them into quantum neural networks (QNNs) may further improve the performance by leveraging quantum resources. However, embedding TTN classifiers into QNNs for multiclass classification remains challenging. Key obstacles are the highorder gate operations required for large bond dimensions and the mid-circuit postselection with exponentially low success rates necessary for the exact embedding. In this work, to address these challenges, we propose forest tensor network (FTN)-classifiers, which aggregate multiple small-bond-dimension TTNs. This allows us to handle multiclass classification without requiring large gates in the embedded circuits. We then remove the overhead of mid-circuit postselection by extending the adiabatic encoding framework to our setting and smoothly encode the FTN-classifiers into a quantum forest tensor network (qFTN)- classifiers. Numerical experiments on MNIST and CIFAR-10 demonstrate that we can successfully train FTN-classifiers and encode them into qFTN-classifiers, while maintaining or even improving the performance of the pre-trained FTN-classifiers. These results suggest that synergy between TTN classification models and QNNs can provide a robust and scalable framework for multiclass quantum-enhanced image classification.",

We consider two different initial states for the system - (i) a polarized spin-up state, and (ii) an infinite temperature state. In the particle representation of the spin chain, the polarized spin-up state corresponds to a filled state, while the polarized spin-down state corresponds to an empty state. Starting from these inhomogeneous quenches, in all the above-mentioned cases we obtain the Page curve like behavior in the entanglement. We report different power-law behavior in the growth of entanglement for different initial states and different kinds of baths (interacting and non-interacting). In an attempt to explore plausible deep connections between entanglement and Boltzmann entropy, we investigate the latter in both the filled and the infinite temperature case, for the system and the bath. For the filled case, the Boltzmann entropy of the system has the form of a Page curve but quantitatively deviates from the entanglement. On the other hand, the entropy of the bath keeps increasing. Remarkably, for the infinite temperature case, we find that the system and bath Boltzmann entropies agree with the entanglement entropy, after and before the Page time, respectively.

The time-dependent variational principle (TDVP) provides a powerful tool to tackle this task by projecting quantum evolution onto a classical dynamical system within a variational manifold. In classical systems, periodic orbits play a crucial role in understanding the structure of the phase space and the long-term behavior of the system. However, finding periodic orbits is generally difficult, and their existence and properties in generic TDVP dynamics over matrix product states have remained largely unexplored. In this work, we develop an algorithm to systematically identify and characterize periodic orbits in TDVP dynamics. Applying our method to the periodically kicked Ising model, we uncover both stable and unstable periodic orbits. We characterize the Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser tori in the vicinity of stable periodic orbits and track the change of the periodic orbits as we modify the Hamiltonian parameters. We observe that periodic orbits exist at any value of the coupling constant between prethermal and fully thermalizing regimes, but their relevance to quantum dynamics and imprint on quantum eigenstates diminishes as the system leaves the prethermal regime. Our results demonstrate that periodic orbits provide valuable insights into the TDVP approximation of quantum many-body evolution and establish a closer connection between quantum and classical chaos.",

This transition, which arises when learning local energy densities, extends all the way from the infinite-temperature paramagnetic state down to the thermal critical state. The intersection of the line of learning transitions and the thermal Ising transition is a novel tricritical point. Our model for learning also describes the effects of weak measurements on a family of quantum states which interpolate between the (topologically ordered) toric code and a trivial product state. Notably, the location of the above tricritical point implies that the quantum memory in the entire topological phase is robust to weak measurement, even when the initial state is arbitrarily close to the quantum phase transition separating topological and trivial phases. Our analysis uses a replica field theory combined with the renormalization group, and we chart out the phase diagram using a combination of tensor network and Monte Carlo techniques.

We further investigate the model using both slave-particle mean-field theory and the density matrix renormalization group method. Our simulation results reveal that the dominate pairing channel is the interlayer one in the $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital. The Hund's coupling is shown to enhance superconductivity within a reasonable physical range. Moreover, electron doping strengthens superconductivity by increasing carrier density; in contrast, hole doping weakens superconductivity.

The neural network method applies to systems with general topology. However, as a variational method, it is not as accurate as tensor networks. In this work, we propose an integrated approach, tensor-network-based variational autoregressive networks (TNVAN), that leverages the strengths of both tensor networks and neural networks: combining the variational autoregressive neural network's ability to compute an upper bound on free energy and perform unbiased sampling from the variational distribution with the tensor network's power to accurately compute the partition function for small sub-systems, resulting in a robust method for precisely estimating free energy. To evaluate the proposed approach, we conducted numerical experiments on spin glass systems with various topologies, including two-dimensional lattices, fully connected graphs, and random graphs. Our numerical results demonstrate the superior accuracy of our method compared to existing approaches.

This paper theoretically studies the property inheritance of the two key tensor properties, namely incoherence and condition number, under the tensor train setting. We also show how tensor train rank is preserved through fiber-wise sampling. The key parameters introduced in theorems are numerically evaluated under various settings. The results show that the properties of interest can be well preserved to the subtensors formed via fiber-wise sampling. Overall, this paper provides several handy analytic tools for developing efficient tensor analysis methods.",

      "abstract": "Quantum computing holds promise for revolutionizing computational chemistry simulations, particularly in drug discovery. However, current quantum hardware is limited by noise and scale, necessitating bridging technologies. This study provides an initial evaluation of tensor network quantum emulators, narrowed to matrix product state-based emulators, for Hamiltonian simulation of pharmaceutical molecules, with a focus on predicting the reactivity of targeted covalent drugs. We assess runtime scaling, accuracy, and resource requirements across various active space sizes, comparing performance to traditional state vector simulation methods. Our results reveal that, for accurate estimation of the expectation value trajectory of a key measurement operator - used as a quantum-derived feature for reactivity prediction - the required bond dimension in matrix product state tensor networks grows rapidly with system size, effectively negating runtime advantages for larger, chemically relevant molecules. This study highlights the fundamental challenges in classically simulating complex quantum chemistry systems and contributes to the support of the irreplaceability premise of quantum computers to efficiently handle strongly entangled systems. Such robustness of fault-tolerant quantum computers leads to practical advantages in drug discovery applications.",

Using an analogy with the massless Dirac equation, second order time and space derivatives in the IWE are reduced to first order, resulting in a Schr\\\"odinger equation of motion. Exact diagonalization of the unitary circuit in combination with Tensor Networks allows simulation of the wave equation with a resolution of $10^{13}$ grid points on a laptop. A method for encoding arbitrary analytical functions into diagonal Matrix Product Operators is employed to prepare and evolve a Matrix Product State (MPS) encoding the solution. Since the method relies on the Quantum Fourier Transform, which has been shown to generate small entanglement when applied to arbitrary MPSs, simulating the evolution of initial conditions with sufficiently low bond dimensions to high accuracy becomes highly efficient, up to the cost of Trotterized propagation and sampling of the wavefunction. We conclude by discussing possible extensions of the approach for carrying out Tensor Network simulations of other partial differential equations such as Maxwell's equations.",

To enable scalable simulations of large systems, we develop a novel, highly efficient algorithm for computing $M_2$ within the matrix product states formalism while maintaining constant bond dimension--an advancement over existing methods. For boundary driving, we uncover universal scaling laws, $M_2(t) \\sim t^{1/z}$, linked to the dynamical exponent $z$ for several distinct universality classes. We also disentangle classical and quantum contributions to magic by introducing a mean-field approximation for magic, thus emphasizing the prominent role of quantum critical fluctuations in non-stabilizerness. For bulk dephasing, dissipation can transiently enhance magic before suppressing it, and drive it to a nontrivial steady-state value. These findings position magic as a powerful diagnostic tool for probing universality and dynamics in open quantum systems.",

Many recent works mostly focus on classical simulation, and rely on full state tomography. Several key algorithmic issues like observable readout, data encoding, and impractical circuit depth remain unsolved. As a result, these are not directly realizable on any quantum hardware. We present a series of novel algorithmic advances which allow us to implement the QLBM algorithm, for the first time, on a quantum computer. Hardware results for the time evolution of a 2D Gaussian initial density distribution subject to a uniform advection-diffusion field are presented. Furthermore, 3D simulation results are presented for particular non-uniform advection fields, devised so as to avoid the problem of diminishing probability of success due to repeated post-selection operations required for multiple timesteps. We demonstrate the evolution of an initial quantum state governed by the advection-diffusion equation, accounting for the iterative nature of the explicit QLBM algorithm. A tensor network encoding scheme is used to represent the initial condition supplied to the advection-diffusion equation, significantly reducing the two-qubit gate count affording a shorter circuit depth. Further reductions are made in the collision and streaming operators. Collectively, these advances give a path to realizing more practical, 2D and 3D QLBM applications with non-trivial velocity fields on quantum hardware.",

This recasts the computation of heat statistics as a standard unitary time-evolution problem, allowing us to leverage powerful tensor-network techniques for simulating quantum dynamics. In particular, we exploit the chain mapping of thermodynamic reservoirs to compute heat fluctuations in the Ohmic spin-boson model.

In this study, we first systematically investigate how different orderings of the TT cores affect the accuracy of computed moments using the duality relation in stochastic processes. Through numerical experiments on a two-body interaction model, we demonstrate that specific orderings of the TT cores yield lower relative errors, particularly when they align with the underlying interaction structure of the system. Motivated by these findings, we then propose a novel quantitative measure, $score$, which is defined based on an ordering of the TT cores and an SDE parameter set. While the score is independent of the accuracy of moments to compute by definition, we assess its effectiveness by evaluating the accuracy of computed moments. Our results indicate that orderings that minimize the score tend to yield higher accuracy. This study provides insights into optimizing orderings of the TT cores, which is essential for efficient and reliable high-dimensional simulations of stochastic processes.",

Although these codes have shed new light on conceptual aspects of these dualities, they have widely been believed to lack a crucial feature of practical quantum error correction: The ability to support universal fault-tolerant quantum logic. In this work, we introduce a new class of holographic codes that realize this feature. These heterogeneous holographic codes are constructed by combining two seed codes in a tensor network on an alternating hyperbolic tiling. We show how this construction generalizes previous strategies for fault tolerance in tree-type concatenated codes, allowing one to implement non-Clifford gates fault-tolerantly on the holographic boundary. We also demonstrate that these codes allow for high erasure thresholds under a suitable heterogeneous combination of specific seed codes. Compared to previous concatenated codes, heterogeneous holographic codes achieve large overhead savings in physical qubits, e.g., a $21.8\\%$ reduction for a two-layer Steane/quantum Reed-Muller combination. Unlike standard concatenated codes, we establish that the new codes can encode more than a single logical qubit per code block by applying ``black hole'' deformations with tunable rate and distance, while possessing fully addressable, universal fault-tolerant gate sets. Therefore, our work strengthens the case for the utility of holographic quantum codes for practical quantum computing.",

For transmon qubits outside of the straddling regime, the results confirm that tunable C-shunt flux couplers are significantly more efficient in mitigating the ZZ interactions than tunable transmons. A recently proposed fluxonium architecture with tunable transmon couplers is demonstrated to also maintain its strong suppression of the ZZ interactions in larger systems, while having a higher inverse participation ratio in the computational basis states than lattices of transmon qubits. Our results thus suggest that fluxonium architectures may feature lower cross talk than transmon lattices when designed to achieve similar gate speeds and fidelities.",

As a resource, magic complements entanglement, and the interplay between these two concepts has garnered significant attention in recent years. In this work, we establish an exact correspondence between the generation of nonlocal magic and operator entanglement under unitary evolutions. Nonlocal magic refers to nonstabilizerness that cannot be erased via local operations, while operator entanglement generalizes entanglement to operator space, characterizing the complexity of operators across a bipartition. Specifically, we prove that a unitary map generates nonlocal magic if and only if it generates operator entanglement on Pauli strings. Guided by this result, we introduce an average measure of a unitary's Pauli-entangling power, serving as a proxy for nonlocal magic generation. We derive analytical formulas for this measure and examine its properties, including its typical value and upper bounds in terms of the nonstabilizerness properties of the evolution.",

Here we employ large-scale density-matrix renormalization group simulations to investigate the effects of next-nearest neighbor exchange couplings $J_2$ and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions $D$, which are relevant to understanding the prototypical kagome materials herbertsmithite and Zn-barlowite. By utilizing clusters as large as XC12 and extrapolating the results to the thermodynamic limit, we precisely delineate the scope of the QSL phase, which remains robust across an expanded parameter range of $J_2$ and $D$. Direct comparison of the simulated static and dynamic spin structure factors with inelastic neutron scattering reveals the parameter space of the Hamiltonians for herbertsmithite and Zn-barlowite, and, importantly, provides compelling evidence that both materials exist within the QSL phase. These results establish a powerful convergence of theory and experiment in this most elusive state of matter.",

Here, we introduce the mutual von-Neumann SRE and magic capacity, which can be efficiently computed in time $O(N\\chi^3)$ for matrix product states (MPSs) of bond dimension $\\chi$. We find that mutual SRE characterizes the critical point of ground states of the transverse-field Ising model, independently of the chosen local basis. Then, we relate the magic capacity to the anti-flatness of the Pauli spectrum, which quantifies the complexity of computing SREs. The magic capacity characterizes transitions in the ground state of the Heisenberg and Ising model, randomness of Clifford+T circuits, and distinguishes typical and atypical states. Finally, we make progress on numerical techniques: we design two improved Monte-Carlo algorithms to compute the mutual $2$-SRE, overcoming limitations of previous approaches based on local update. We also give improved statevector simulation methods for Bell sampling and SREs with $O(8^{N/2})$ time and $O(2^N)$ memory, which we demonstrate for $24$ qubits. Our work uncovers improved approaches to study the complexity of quantum many-body systems.",

The NATT scheme, by construction, automatically searches for a tree structure that best fits a given discrete dataset whose features serve as inputs, and has the advantage that it is interpretable as a probabilistic graphical model. We consider the NATT scheme and a recently proposed Born machine adaptive tensor tree (BMATT) optimization scheme and demonstrate their effectiveness on a variety of generative modeling tasks where the objective is to infer the hidden structure of a provided dataset. Our results show that in terms of minimizing the negative log-likelihood, the single-layer scheme has model performance comparable to the Born machine scheme, though not better. The tasks include deducing the structure of binary bitwise operations, learning the internal structure of random Bayesian networks given only visible sites, and a real-world example related to hierarchical clustering where a cladogram is constructed from mitochondrial DNA sequences. In doing so, we also show the importance of the choice of network topology and the versatility of a least-mutual information criterion in selecting a candidate structure for a tensor tree, as well as discuss aspects of these tensor tree generative models including their information content and interpretability.",

However, resource-constrained platforms face significant challenges due to the intensive computational and memory demands of DNN training. Tensor decomposition emerges as a promising approach to compress model size without sacrificing accuracy. Nevertheless, training tensorized neural networks (TNNs) incurs non-trivial overhead and severe performance degradation on conventional accelerators due to complex tensor shaping requirements. To address these challenges, we propose FETTA, an algorithm and hardware co-optimization framework for efficient TNN training. On the algorithm side, we develop a contraction sequence search engine (CSSE) to identify the optimal contraction sequence with the minimal computational overhead. On the hardware side, FETTA features a flexible and efficient architecture equipped with a reconfigurable contraction engine (CE) array to support diverse dataflows. Furthermore, butterfly-based distribution and reduction networks are implemented to perform flexible tensor shaping operations during computation. Evaluation results demonstrate that FETTA achieves reductions of 20.5x/100.9x, 567.5x/45.03x, and 11609.7x/4544.8x in terms of processing latency, energy, and energy-delay product (EDP) over GPU and TPU, respectively. Moreover, working on the tensorized training, FETTA outperforms prior accelerators with a speedup of 3.87~14.63x, and an energy efficiency improvement of 1.41~2.73x on average.",

Deep learning has become a viable alternative for quickly generating high-quality solutions, particularly when metaheuristics underperform.

Despite these advancements, a thorough comparison of the different paradigms is missing. This study evaluates eight algorithms on Weighted Max-Cut graphs ranging from 10 to 250 nodes. Specifically, we compare a Genetic Algorithm representing metaheuristics, a Graph Neural Network for deep learning, and the Density Matrix Renormalization Group as a tensor network approach. Our analysis focuses on solution quality and computational efficiency (i.e., time and memory usage). Numerical results show that the Genetic Algorithm achieves near-optimal results for small graphs, although its computation time grows significantly with problem size. The Graph Neural Network offers a balanced solution for medium-sized instances with low memory demands and rapid inference, yet it exhibits more significant variability on larger graphs. Meanwhile, the Tensor Network approach consistently yields high approximation ratios and efficient execution on larger graphs, albeit with increased memory consumption.",

Recent widespread interest in quantum materials -- where strong correlation plays a crucial role in the quantum effects governing their behavior -- further highlights the need for theoretical methods capable of rigorously treating such correlation. Here, we present a periodic generalization of variational two-electron reduced density matrix (2-RDM) theory, a bootstrapping-type method that minimizes the ground-state energy as a functional of the 2-RDM without relying on the wavefunction. The 2-RDM is computed directly by semidefinite programming with $N$-representability conditions, ensuring accurate treatment of strongly correlated electronic systems. By exploiting translational symmetry, we significantly reduce computational scaling, enabling applications to realistic materials-scale systems. Additionally, we introduce an alternative to conventional energy band structures: natural-orbital occupation-number bands, which, being independent of mean-field assumptions, offer deeper insights into electron correlation effects. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach by applying the theory to hydrogen chains, molybdenum disulfide, and nickel oxide, showing that natural-orbital occupation bands correctly capture electronic character in regimes where density functional theory fails.

In this work, we shift the focus to dynamical probes, specifically the steady-state spin current, to investigate transport properties in a disordered, non-Hermitian XXZ spin chain. Through exact diagonalization for small systems and tensor-network methods for larger chains, we demonstrate that the steady-state current remains finite and decays exponentially with disorder strength, showing no evidence of a transition up to disorder values far beyond the previously claimed critical point. Our results reveal a stark discrepancy between spectral indicators, which suggest localization, and transport behavior, which indicates delocalization. This highlights the importance of dynamical observables in characterizing NH MBL and suggests that traditional spectral measures may not fully capture the physics of non-Hermitian systems. Additionally, we observe a non-commutativity of limits in system size and time, further complicating the interpretation of finite-size studies.

To address this, we propose the perturbative variational quantum eigensolver (PT-VQE). In PT-VQE, VQE is used to capture key correlations within a carefully selected active space, while perturbation theory efficiently incorporates interactions in the remaining space, without requiring additional qubits or circuit depth. When the VQE-optimized state closely approximates the true ground state in the active space, excitations cannot act solely in the active space, since their contributions to perturbative correction are negligible. This reduces the highest-order required RDM from 4-RDM to 3-RDM, significantly reducing computational costs. We validate PT-VQE by calculating the ground-state potential energy surfaces (PESs) of $\\rm{HF}$ and $\\rm{N}_2$, as well as the ground-state energy of ferrocene ($\\rm{Fe(C_5H_5)_2}$). Additionally, PT-VQE is performed on a quantum computer to compute the PES of ${\\rm F}_2$. The consistent results obtained from both PT-VQE with the highest 3-RDM and 4-RDM confirm the reliability of the constraint. PT-VQE significantly outperforms standard VQE, achieving chemical accuracy. This method offers a resource-efficient and practical approach for accurate quantum simulations of larger systems.",

The topological phase transition from a trivial insulator to the nontrivial Haldane phase is characterized by significant changes in magnetic properties, edge correlations, and the appearance of a nonzero string order parameter. Furthermore, we confirm the topological nature of this phase through a detailed analysis of the spin gap and entanglement spectrum, demonstrating clear signatures of symmetry-protected topological order.",

Our study focuses on the case where the intraorbital and interorbital Coulomb interactions are equal (U = U2) and the Hund's coupling is absent (J = 0). Spectral analysis confirms the absence of an orbital-selective Mott transition (OSMT), even in systems with significantly different bandwidths (t1 and t2 for the wide and narrow bands, respectively), indicating a simultaneous Mott transition in both bands. Notably, the NRG results reveal the emergence of a pseudo-gap-like feature and a central peak in the narrow band, whose characteristics depend on the hopping parameter t2. These spectral features may serve as precursors to OSMT in more realistic systems with finite Hund's coupling (J > 0). Furthermore, in the Mott insulating phase, the self-energies of both bands diverge, suggesting that the Mott transition represents a topological phase transition. Our results highlight the crucial role of accurate impurity solvers in capturing the density of states and detailed spectral structures.",

      "abstract": "Tensor networks serve as a powerful tool for efficiently representing and manipulating high-dimensional data in applications such as quantum physics, machine learning, and data compression. Tensor Decision Diagrams (TDDs) offer an efficient framework for tensor representation by leveraging decision diagram techniques. However, the current implementation of TDDs and other decision diagrams fail to exploit tensor isomorphisms, limiting their compression potential. This paper introduces Local Invertible Map Tensor Decision Diagrams (LimTDDs), an extension of TDDs that incorporates local invertible maps (LIMs) to achieve more compact representations. Unlike LIMDD, which uses Pauli operators for quantum states, LimTDD employs the $XP$-stabilizer group, enabling broader applicability across tensor-based tasks. We present efficient algorithms for normalization, slicing, addition, and contraction, critical for tensor network applications. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that LimTDDs achieve greater compactness than TDDs and, in best-case scenarios and for quantum state representations, offer exponential compression advantages over both TDDs and LIMDDs. Experimental results in quantum circuit tensor computation and simulation confirm LimTDD's superior efficiency. Open-source code is available at https://github.com/Veriqc/LimTDD.",

      "abstract": "Numerical studies of phase transitions in statistical and quantum lattice models provide crucial insights into the corresponding Conformal Field Theories (CFTs). In higher dimensions, comparing finite-volume numerical results to infinite-volume CFT data is facilitated by choosing the sphere $S^{d-1}$ as the spatial manifold. Recently, the fuzzy sphere regulator in Ref. [Zhu et al, Phys. Rev. X 13 021009 (2023)] has enabled such studies with exact rotational invariance, yielding impressive agreement with known 3D Ising CFT predictions, as well as new results. However, systematic improvements and a deeper understanding of finite-size corrections remain essential. In this work, we revisit the fuzzy sphere regulator, focusing on the original Ising model, with two main goals. First, we assess the robustness of this approach using Conformal Perturbation Theory (CPT), to which we provide a detailed guidebook. We demonstrate how CPT provides a unified framework for determining the critical point, the speed of light, and residual deviations from CFT predictions. Applying this framework, we study finite-size corrections and clarify the role of tuning the model in minimizing these effects. Second, we develop a novel method for extracting Operator Product Expansion (OPE) coefficients from fuzzy sphere data. This method leverages the sensitivity of energy levels to detuning from criticality, providing new insights into level mixing and avoided crossings in finite systems. Our work also includes validation of CPT in a 1+1D Ising model away from the integrable limit.",

However, with improvements in performance, the parameter size of DLRMs has grown to terabyte (TB) scales, accompanied by memory bandwidth demands exceeding TB/s levels. Furthermore, the workload intensity within the model varies based on the target mechanism, making it difficult to build an optimized recommendation system. In this paper, we propose SCRec, a scalable computational storage recommendation system that can handle TB-scale industrial DLRMs while guaranteeing high bandwidth requirements. SCRec utilizes a software framework that features a mixed-integer programming (MIP)-based cost model, efficiently fetching data based on data access patterns and adaptively configuring memory-centric and compute-centric cores. Additionally, SCRec integrates hardware acceleration cores to enhance DLRM computations, particularly allowing for the high-performance reconstruction of approximated embedding vectors from extremely compressed tensor-train (TT) format. By combining its software framework and hardware accelerators, while eliminating data communication overhead by being implemented on a single server, SCRec achieves substantial improvements in DLRM inference performance.

In this case, we decompose the limiting Hilbert space and the algebras of observables in a way that keeps track of the entanglement in the network. As a specific example, we describe this inductive limit for the holographic HaPPY code model and relate its algebraic and error-correction features. We find that the local algebras in this model are given by the hyperfinite type II$_\\infty$ factor. Next, we discuss other networks that build upon this framework and comment on a connection between type II factors and stabilizer circuits. We conclude with a discussion of MERA networks in which complementary recovery is broken. We argue that this breaking possibly permits a limiting type III von Neumann algebra, making them more suitable ans\\\"atze for approximating subregions of quantum field theories.",

Our calculations suggest that the chain can transition between a hidden $Z_2\\times Z_2$ discrete symmetry preserving tetramer phase and a Haldane phase with non-vanishing string order that breaks the hidden symmetry. These two gapped phases are intervened by an intermediate deconfined quantum critical state comprising of free spins and three-site doublets, which is a gapless critical phase with deconfined spinons. We find that the tetramer chain can support fractionalized (spinon) and collective (triplon and quinton) excitations. In the ferromagnetic intra-tetramer limit, the chain can support a quinton excitation which has a five-fold degenerate excited state. String order parameter calculations suggest CuInVO$_5$ to be in a Haldane-like phase whose $L$ -edge RIXS spectrum can support observable triplon and quinton excitations. We also identify possible two-particle excitations (two-singlon, two-triplon, triplon-quinton, and two-quinton excitations) resulting from the double spin-flip effect in the $K$ -edge RIXS spectrum.",

In this study, we perform large-scale density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) to explore the quantum phase diagram of the generalized spin-3/2 Kitaev-Heisenberg (K-H) model accompanied with SIA $A_c$. In the $A_c=0$ limit, the spin-3/2 K-H model exhibits a quantum phase diagram similar to that of a spin-1/2 system, including two QSLs around antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic Kitaev models. For models with finite $A_c$, we map out the quantum phase diagram around two Kitaev points and observe distinct types of in-plane vortex orders developed from these two QSL phases. Interestingly, series of nearly degenerate vortex configurations are discovered in each vortex phases. Using linear spin-wave theory, we demonstrate that these vortex configurations can be understood as a consequence of the quantum correction on a continuous family of degenerate classical states.",

Thus, the ground state of the $\\sigma t$-$J$ model can serve as a well-controlled reference state of the standard $t$-$J$ model. In the absence of phase string, the spin long-range antiferromagnetic (AFM) order is found to be essentially decoupled from the doped holes, and the latter contribute to a Fermi-liquid-like compressibility and a coherent single-particle propagation with a markedly reduced pairing tendency. In contrast, our TN calculations of the $t$-$J$ model indicate that the AFM order decreases much faster with doping and the single-particle propagation of doped holes gets substantially suppressed, concurrently with a much stronger charge compressibility at small doping and a significantly amplified Cooper pairing tendencies. These findings demonstrate that quantum many-body interference from phase strings plays a pivotal role in the $t$-$J$ model, mediating long-range entanglement between spin and charge degrees of freedom.",

To fully characterize the discretized Dean-Kawasaki model, we solve the associated Fokker-Planck equation of the SDE dynamics. In particular, we use a particle-based approach whereby the solution to the Fokker-Planck equation is obtained by performing a series of density estimation tasks from the simulated trajectories, and we use a functional hierarchical tensor model to represent the density. To address the challenge that the sample trajectories are supported on a simplex, we apply a coordinate transformation from the simplex to a Euclidean space by logarithmic parameterization, after which we apply a sketching-based density estimation procedure on the transformed variables. Our approach is general and can be applied to general density estimation tasks over a simplex. We apply the proposed method successfully to the 1D and 2D Dean-Kawasaki models.

As a consequence, we find that matrix multiplication moment polytopes are not maximal, i.e. are strictly contained in the corresponding Kronecker polytope. As another consequence, we obtain a no-go result for a natural operational characterization of moment polytope inclusion in terms of asymptotic restriction. We generalize the separation and non-maximality to moment polytopes of iterated matrix multiplication tensors. Our result implies that tensor networks where multipartite entanglement structures beyond two-party entanglement are allowed can go beyond projected entangled-pair states (PEPS) in terms of expressivity. Our proof characterizes membership of uniform points in moment polytopes of tensors, and establishes a connection to polynomial multiplication tensors via the minrank of matrix subspaces. As a result of independent interest, we extend these techniques to obtain a new proof of the optimal border subrank bound for matrix multiplication.",

In this work, we conduct a systematic numerical analysis of quantum tunneling in one-dimensional Mott insulators described by the extended ($U$-$V$) Hubbard model. We discuss the applicability of the analytical formula for doublon-holon (DH) pair production, previously derived for the one-dimensional Hubbard model, which highlights the relationship between the tunneling threshold, the charge gap, and the correlation length. We test the formulas ability to predict both DH pair production and energy increase rate. Using tensor-network-based approaches, we demonstrate that the formula provides accurate predictions in the absence of excitonic states facilitated by the nearest-neighbor interaction $V$. However, when excitonic states emerge, the formula more accurately describes the rate of energy increase than the DH pair creation rate and in both cases gets improved by incorporating the exciton energy as the effective gap.",

Focusing on the SO(5) and the SO(6) ferromagnetic spin chains as illustrative examples, finite system-size scaling analysis of the entanglement entropy for this set of orthonormal basis states confirms that the entanglement entropy scales logarithmically with block size in the thermodynamic limit. The prefactor in front of the logarithm is half the number of type-B Goldstone modes $N_B$, which is identified as the fractal dimension $d_f$ for these orthonormal basis states.

Traditionally, a temperature is assigned to an energy \\emph{eigenvalue} through the textbook canonical temperature-energy relationship. However, in this work, we use the \\emph{eigenstate subsystem temperature} -- a recently developed quantity that assigns a temperature to an energy eigenstate, based on the structure of its reduced density matrix. For a thermal state, the eigenstate subsystem temperature is approximately equal to its canonical temperature. Given that quantum many-body scars have a ground-state-like entanglement structure, it is not immediately clear that their eigenstate subsystem temperature would be close to their canonical temperature. Surprisingly, we find that this is the case: the quantum many-body scars have approximate ``knowledge'' of their position in the spectrum encoded within their state structure.",

Yet, drive-induced heating normally destabilizes the systems, which can be parametrically suppressed in the high-frequency regime by using periodic (Floquet) drives. It remains largely unknown to what extent highly controllable quantum simulators can suppress heating in non-periodically driven systems. Using the 78-qubit superconducting quantum processor, Chuang-tzu 2.0, we report the experimental observation of long-lived prethermal phases in many-body systems with tunable heating rates, driven by structured random protocols, characterized by $n$-multipolar temporal correlations. By measuring both the particle imbalance and subsystem entanglement entropy, we monitor the entire heating process over 1,000 driving cycles and observe the existence of the prethermal plateau. The prethermal lifetime is `doubly tunable': one way by driving frequency, the other by multipolar order; it grows algebraically with the frequency with the universal scaling exponent $2n{+}1$. Using quantum state tomography on different subsystems, we demonstrate a non-uniform spatial entanglement distribution and observe a crossover from area-law to volume-law entanglement scaling. With 78 qubits and 137 couplers in a 2D configuration, the entire far-from-equilibrium heating dynamics are beyond the reach of simulation using tensor-network numerical techniques. Our work highlights superconducting quantum processors as a powerful platform for exploring universal scaling laws and non-equilibrium phases of matter in driven systems in regimes where classical simulation faces formidable challenges.",

Each sub-network learns a low-dimensional data component (e.g., spatial or temporal). Then, we combine these components via tensor operations, reducing forward pass complexity while improving accuracy through specialized learning. F-INR is modular and, therefore, architecture-agnostic, compatible with MLPs, SIREN, WIRE, or other state-of-the-art INR architecture. It is also decomposition-agnostic, supporting CP, TT, and Tucker modes with user-defined rank for speed-accuracy control. In our experiments, F-INR trains $100\\times$ faster than existing approaches on video tasks while achieving higher fidelity (+3.4 dB PSNR). Similar gains hold for image compression, physics simulations, and 3D geometry reconstruction. Through this, F-INR offers a new scalable, flexible solution for high-dimensional signal modeling.",

While universal scaling laws are well established in quantum systems, the applicability of Family-Vicsek scaling in quantum many-body dynamics remains largely unexplored. Motivated by this, we investigate the infinite-temperature dynamics of one-dimensional $SU(N)$ spin chains, focusing on the well-known $SU(2)$ XXZ model and the $SU(3)$ Izergin-Korepin model. We compute the quantum analogue of classical surface roughness using the second cumulant of spin fluctuations and demonstrate universal scaling with respect to time and subsystem size. By systematically breaking global $SU(N)$ symmetry and integrability, we identify distinct transport regimes characterized by the dynamical exponent $z$: (i) ballistic transport with $z=1$, (ii) superdiffusive transport with the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang exponent $z=3/2$, and (iii) diffusive transport with the Edwards-Wilkinson exponent $z=2$. Notably, breaking integrability always drives the system into the diffusive regime. Our results demonstrate that Family-Vicsek scaling extends beyond classical systems, holding universally across quantum many-body models with $SU(N)$ symmetry.",

      "abstract": "We devise tractable models of unitary quantum many-body dynamics on tree graphs, as a first step towards a deeper understanding of dynamics in non-Euclidean spaces. To this end, we first demonstrate how to construct strictly local quantum circuits that preserve the symmetries of trees, such that their dynamical light cones grow isotropically. For trees with coordination number z, such circuits can be built from z-site gates. We then introduce a family of gates for which the dynamics is exactly solvable; these satisfy a set of constraints that we term 'tree-unitarity'. Notably, tree-unitarity reduces to the previously-established notion of dual-unitarity for z = 2, when the tree reduces to a line. Among the unexpected features of tree-unitarity is a trade-off between 'maximum butterfly velocity' dynamics of out-of-time-order correlators and the existence of non-vanishing correlation functions in multiple directions, a tension absent in one-dimensional dual-unitary models and their Euclidean generalizations. We connect the existence of (a wide class of) solvable dynamics with non-maximal butterfly velocity directly to a property of the underlying circuit geometry called $\\delta$-hyperbolicity, and argue that such dynamics can only arise in non-Euclidean geometries. We give various examples of tree-unitary gates, discuss dynamical correlations, out-of-time-order correlators, and entanglement growth, and show that the kicked Ising model on a tree is a physically-motivated example of maximum-velocity tree-unitary dynamics.",

Our focus lies on out-of-time order correlators (OTOCs) which we project on sectors with a fixed number of particles. This allows us to link the non-interacting system to the fully-interacting one by allowing more and more particle to interact with each other, keeping the interaction parameter fixed. While at short times, the OTOCs are almost not affected by interactions, the spreading of the information front becomes gradually faster and the OTOC saturate at larger values as the number of particle increases. We also study the behavior of finite-size systems by considering the OTOCs at times beyond the point where the front hits the boundary of the system. We find that in every sector with more than one particle, the OTOCs behave as if the local operator was rotated by a random unitary matrix, indicating that the presence of boundaries contributes to the maximal scrambling of local operators.",

      "abstract": "The ground-state properties of the single-band triangular lattice Hubbard model with hopping anisotropy and strong interactions remain elusive so far. Here we show that twisted diamond homobilayers with band extrema at $Y$ valley can realize weakly-coupled chains with quasi-1D band structure; applying displacement field generates interchain hopping, transforming this quasi-1D system into a 2D one. The low-energy physics can be described by localized Wannier functions on the triangular lattice with tunable hopping anisotropy, providing a promising platform for studying the anisotropic triangular lattice Hubbard model. We further employ density matrix renormalization group to study this model with interaction $U=10t$ and anisotropy $0.5\\leq t'/t\\leq 1.5$ at half filling, and obtain a rich ground state phase diagram, including a chiral spin liquid phase, non-magnetic phases, and a N\\'eel antiferromagnetic phase.

A notable development in this area is the introduction of a complex-time evolution scheme for tensor network states, originally suggested for solving Anderson impurity model and designed to suppress the growth of entanglement under time evolution. In this study, we employ the complex-time evolution scheme to investigate the dynamics of one-dimensional spin systems, specifically the transverse-field Ising model (TFIM) and the XXZ model. Our analysis revisits the dynamic critical exponent $z$ of the TFIM and explores the dynamical structure factor in both gapped and gapless states of the XXZ model. Importantly, the complex-time evolution reproduces the results of real-time evolution while mitigating the rapid growth of quantum entanglement typically associated with the latter. These results demonstrate that the combination of complex-time evolution and extrapolation provides a robust and efficient framework for studying the dynamics of complex quantum systems, enabling more comprehensive insights into their behavior.",

Majorana Propagation can be used either independently, or in conjunction with quantum hardware, to simulate Fermionic systems relevant to quantum chemistry and condensed matter. We exemplify this by using Majorana Propagation to find circuits that approximate ground states for strongly correlated systems of up to 52 Fermionic modes.

The conventional CP decomposition algorithm combines alternating least squares (ALS) with the normal equation. However, the normal equation is susceptible to numerical ill-conditioning, which can adversely affect the decomposition results. To mitigate this issue, ALS combined with QR decomposition has been proposed as a more numerically stable alternative. Although this method enhances stability, its iterative process involves tensor-times-matrix (TTM) operations, which typically result in higher computational costs. To reduce this cost, we propose branch reutilization of dimension tree, which increases the reuse of intermediate tensors and reduces the number of TTM operations. This strategy achieves a $33\\%$ reduction in computational complexity for third and fourth order tensors. Additionally, we introduce a specialized extrapolation method in CP-ALS-QR algorithm, leveraging the unique structure of the matrix $\\mathbf{Q}_0$ to further enhance convergence. By integrating both techniques, we develop a novel CP decomposition algorithm that significantly improves efficiency. Numerical experiments on five real-world datasets show that our proposed algorithm reduces iteration costs and enhances fitting accuracy compared to the CP-ALS-QR algorithm.",

For this aim, we address a generic Hubbard model that captures the quantum phase transitions between metal, Mott insulator, and charge-density-wave insulator, in the absence of Fermi-surface nesting. By comparing the quantum phase diagrams for the $1/r$-Hubbard model on a half-filled chain with nearest-neighbor and $1/r$-long-range interactions, we argue that the inclusion of long-range interactions is not crucial for a proper description of interacting many-electron systems. To this end, we employ the Density Matrix Renormalization Group method on finite lattices and antiperiodic boundary conditions to determine the quantum phase transitions between the metallic Luttinger liquid for weak interactions, the Mott-Hubbard insulator for dominant on-site interactions, and the charge-density wave insulator for dominant inter-site interactions. The two phase diagrams qualitatively agree inasmuch as the quantum phase transitions are continuous in both cases. Moreover, simple Hartree-Fock theory and the atomic limit provide renormalization factors that allow us to quantitatively map the two phase diagrams onto each other. As a practical advantage, our findings imply that computational efforts can be reduced tremendously by using models with short-range interactions only.",

Recently, a compact way of storing subregions' purities by encoding them as amplitudes of a fictitious quantum wave function, known as entanglement feature, was proposed. Notably, the entanglement feature can be a simple object even for highly entangled quantum states. However the complexity and practical usage of the entanglement feature for general quantum states has not been explored. In this work, we demonstrate that the entanglement feature can be efficiently learned using only a polynomial amount of samples in the number of degrees of freedom through the so-called tensor cross interpolation (TCI) algorithm, assuming it is expressible as a finite bond dimension MPS. We benchmark this learning process on Haar and random MPS states, confirming analytic expectations. Applying the TCI algorithm to quantum eigenstates of various one dimensional quantum systems, we identify cases where eigenstates have entanglement feature learnable with TCI. We conclude with possible applications of the learned entanglement feature, such as quantifying the distance between different entanglement patterns and finding the optimal one-dimensional ordering of physical indices in a given state, highlighting the potential utility of the proposed purity interpolation method.",

      "abstract": "Quantum error correction is essential for achieving practical quantum computing but has a significant computational overhead. Among fault-tolerant (FT) gate operations, non-Clifford gates, such as $T$, are particularly expensive due to their reliance on magic state distillation. These costly $T$ gates appear frequently in FT circuits as many quantum algorithms require arbitrary single-qubit rotations, such as $R_x$ and $R_z$ gates, which must be decomposed into a sequence of $T$ and Clifford gates. In many quantum circuits, $R_x$ and $R_z$ gates can be fused to form a single $U3$ unitary. However, existing synthesis methods, such as gridsynth, rely on indirect decompositions, requiring separate $R_z$ decompositions that result in a threefold increase in $T$ count. This work presents a novel FT synthesis algorithm that directly synthesizes arbitrary single-qubit unitaries, avoiding the overhead of separate $R_z$ decompositions.

      "abstract": "Inspired by natural cooling processes, dissipation has become a promising approach for preparing low-energy states of quantum systems. However, the potential of dissipative protocols remains unclear beyond certain commuting Hamiltonians. This work provides significant analytical and numerical insights into the power of dissipation for preparing the ground state of non-commuting Hamiltonians. For quasi-free dissipative dynamics, including certain 1D spin systems with boundary dissipation, our results reveal a new connection between the mixing time in trace distance and the spectral properties of a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, leading to an explicit and sharp bound on the mixing time that scales polynomially with system size. For more general spin systems, we develop a tensor network-based algorithm for constructing the Lindblad jump operator and for simulating the dynamics. Using this algorithm, we demonstrate numerically that dissipative ground state preparation protocols can achieve rapid mixing for certain 1D local Hamiltonians under bulk dissipation, with a mixing time that scales logarithmically with the system size. We then prove the rapid mixing result for certain weakly interacting spin and fermionic systems in arbitrary dimensions, extending recent results for high-temperature quantum Gibbs samplers to the zero-temperature regime. Our theoretical approaches are applicable to systems with singular stationary states, and are thus expected to have applications beyond the specific systems considered in this study.",

We present a set of applications of the package, starting with the widely used benchmark case of the photo-excitation dynamics of 24 mode pyrazine, following which we consider a more challenging model describing the exciton dynamics at the interface of a $n$-oligothiophene donor-C$_{60}$ fullerene acceptor system. Finally, we consider applications to open quantum systems, including the spin-boson model, a set of extended dissipative spin models, and an Anderson impurity model.

Recently, this concept has been extended to the mixed states of open systems, attracting considerable attention due to the emergence of novel physics beyond closed systems. In this work, we reveal a new type of phase transition in mixed states, termed \\emph{quantum} strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking (SWSSB). Using a combination of field theory calculations and large-scale matrix product state simulations, we map out the global phase diagram of the XXZ critical spin chain under local strong symmetry preserving decoherence, which features an SWSSB phase and a trivial Luttinger liquid phase, separated by a straight critical line that belongs to the boundary Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless universality class with a varying effective central charge. Importantly, we analyze this transition from two complementary perspectives: on one hand, through the behavior of order parameters that characterize the symmetry breaking; on the other hand, from a quantum information viewpoint by studying entropic quantities and the concept of quantum recoverability. Remarkably, the SWSSB transition in our case is \\emph{purely quantum} in the sense that it can only be driven by tuning the Hamiltonian parameter even under arbitrary decoherence strength, fundamentally distinguishing it from the decoherence-driven SWSSB transitions extensively discussed in previous literature. Importantly, our unified theoretical framework is applicable to a broad class of one-dimensional quantum systems, including spin chains and fermionic systems, whose low-energy physics can be described by Luttinger liquid theory, under arbitrary symmetry-preserving decoherence channels.

Recently, the stabilizer R\\'{e}nyi entropy (SRE) has emerged as a computationally tractable measure of nonstabilizerness, a crucial resource for fault-tolerant universal quantum computation. While numerical results suggested that the SRE in critical states can exhibit universal behavior, its comprehensive theoretical understanding has remained elusive. In this work, we develop a field-theoretical framework for the SRE in a $(1+1)$-dimensional many-body system and elucidate its universal aspects using boundary conformal field theory. We demonstrate that the SRE is equivalent to a participation entropy in the Bell basis of a doubled Hilbert space, which can be calculated from the partition function of a replicated field theory with the interlayer line defect created by the Bell-state measurements. This identification allows us to characterize the universal contributions to the SRE on the basis of the data of conformal boundary conditions imposed on the replicated theory. We find that the SRE of the entire system contains a universal size-independent term determined by the noninteger ground-state degeneracy known as the g-factor. In contrast, we show that the mutual SRE exhibits the logarithmic scaling with a universal coefficient given by the scaling dimension of a boundary condition changing operator, which elucidates the origin of universality previously observed in numerical results. As a concrete demonstration, we present a detailed analysis of the Ising criticality, where we analytically derive the universal quantities at arbitrary R\\'{e}nyi indices and numerically validate them with high accuracy by employing tensor network methods. These results establish a field-theoretical approach to understanding the universal features of nonstabilizerness in quantum many-body systems.",

However, its representation capacity is constrained in complex tasks or high-rank dependency settings, potentially limiting model adaptability. To overcome the expressive bottleneck in classical low-rank approximation for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs), we propose Quantum Tensor Hybrid Adaptation (QTHA), a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method that integrates a quantum neural network (QNN) with a tensor network. QTHA explores quantum tensor hybrid fine-tuning within low-rank spaces by decomposing pre-trained weights into quantum neural network and tensor network representations, leveraging quantum state superposition to overcome classical rank limitations. Experiments demonstrate that QTHA achieves performance comparable to or surpassing LoRA in parameter-efficient fine-tuning. Compared to LoRA, QTHA reduces trainable parameters by 76% while reducing training loss by up to 17% and improving test set performance by up to 17% within the same training steps. This research not only enables lightweight adaptation of quantum resources to the billion-parameter models but also validates the feasibility of quantum hardware optimization driven by LLM tasks.

For an open chain with given boundary conditions described by a 2D conformal field theory~(CFT), the entanglement spectrum of the left/right half of the system coincides with a boundary CFT spectrum, where one of the boundary conditions arise due to the `entanglement cut'. The latter has been argued to be conformal and has been numerically found to be the `free' boundary condition for Ising, Potts and free boson theories. For these models, the `free' boundary condition for the lattice degree of freedom has a counterpart in the continuum theory. However, this is not true in general. Here, this question is analyzed for the unitary minimal models of 2D CFTs using the density matrix renormalization group technique. The entanglement spectra are computed for blocks of spins in open chains of A-type restricted solid-on-solid models with identical boundary conditions at the ends. The imposed boundary conditions are realized exactly for these lattice models due to their integrable nature. The obtained entanglement spectra are in good agreement with certain boundary CFT spectra. The boundary condition for the entanglement cut is found to be conformal and to coincide with the one with the highest boundary entropy. This identification enables determination of the exponents governing the unusual corrections to the entanglement entropy from the CFT partition functions. These are compared with numerical results.",

The reactive molecule is modeled using a triple-well potential, allowing two competing reaction pathways that yield distinct products. Dynamical and equilibrium simulations are performed using the numerically exact hierarchical equations of motion approach in real- and imaginary-time formulations, respectively, both implemented with tree tensor network decomposition schemes. We consider two illustrative cases: one dominated by slow kinetics and another by ultrafast processes. Our results demonstrate that the rates of ground-state reaction pathways can be selectively enhanced when the cavity frequency is tuned into resonance with a vibrational transition directly leading to the formation of the corresponding product, even when that transition is spectroscopically dark. However, tuning cavity frequency to match an absorption-dominant transition shared across both reaction pathways does not necessarily result in pronounced rate enhancements and selectivity. Together with an additional analysis using an asymmetric double-well model, we highlight the greater complexity of underlying factors governing chemical reactivity, which extend beyond considerations of transition dipole strengths and thermal population distributions that shape linear spectroscopy. Furthermore, we found that in all scenarios, the equilibrium populations remain unchanged when the molecule is moved into the cavity, regardless of the cavity frequency. Thus, our study confirms at a fully quantum-mechanical level that cavity-induced modifications of chemical reactivities in resonant conditions arise from dynamical and non-equilibrium interactions between the cavity mode and molecular vibrations, rather than from the significant changes in equilibrium properties.",

      "abstract": "It is known rigorously that the phase transition of the $q$-state ferromagnetic Potts model on the square lattice is second order for $q=4$. Despite this fact, some observables of the $q=4$ model show features of a first-order phase transition. For example, negative peak appears for the quantity of Binder ratio $Q_2$ of this model. Such a non-monotonic behavior of $Q_2$ is typically a consequence of phase coexistence, hence is served as a signal of a first-order phase transition. In particular, the negative peak should diverge with linear system size $L$ squared. Since the mentioned divergence phenomenon is not observed for the 4-state Potts model, the scenario of a first-order phase transition for this model is ruled out. Interestingly, a recent large scale Monte Carlo investigation of the 4-state Potts model observes that the two-peak structure of the energy density distribution becomes more noticeable when $L$ increases. This finding indicates the signal of coexistence of phases is getting stronger with $L$. Due to these unusual critical behaviors, here we study the energy density $E$ and the specific heat $C_v$ of the 4-state Potts model on the square lattice using the technique of bond weighted tensor renormalization group (BWTRG). For a comparison purpose, $q=2$ and $q=5$ ferromagnetic Potts models on the square lattice are investigated using the same method as well. Remarkably, our results do imply there may be a small energy gap for $q=4$ model. While the appearance of the mentioned small energy gap can be explained plausibly and it will disappear with a more sophisticated investigation, our finding suggests that whether a message of a first-order phase transition is genuine or is an artificial effect requires further and detailed investigations.",

To address these issues, a tensor network pretraining framework that initializes a quantum circuit ansatz with a classically computed high-quality solution for a linear entanglement structure has been proposed in literature. In order to improve the classical solution, the quantum circuit needs to be extended, while it is still an open question how the extension affects trainability. In this work, we propose the metric-based extension heuristic to design an extended circuit based on a similarity metric measured between the dataset features. We validate this method on the bars and stripes dataset and carry out experiments on financial data.

A key feature of the system is the separation of energy scales for charge and spin excitations, which is reflected in the temperature dependence of thermodynamic quantities and the disparity between spin and charge gaps extracted from their respective susceptibilities. At the critical point, both spin and charge susceptibilities exhibit singularities, suggesting that charge excitations are not fully decoupled from their spin counterparts. Additionally, the double occupancy number exhibits a non-monotonic temperature dependence, indicative of an entropy-driven Pomeranchuk effect. These results demonstrate that the loopless Bethe lattice effectively captures the essential physics of the Hubbard model while providing a computationally efficient framework for studying strongly correlated electronic systems.",

In this work, we develop an algorithm integrating DMRG within the multiwavelet-based multiresolution analysis (MRA). Unlike fixed basis sets, multiwavelets offer an adaptive and hierarchical representation of functions, approaching the complete basis set limit to a specified precision. As a result, this combined technique leverages the multireference capability of DMRG and the complete basis set limit of MRA and multiwavelets. More specifically, we adopt a pre-existing Lagrangian optimization algorithm for orbitals represented in the MRA domain and improve its computational efficiency by replacing the original CI calculations with DMRG. Additionally, we substitute the reduced density matrices computation with the direct extraction of energy gradients from the DMRG tensors. We apply our method to small systems such H2, He, HeH2, BeH2 and N2. The results demonstrate that our approach reduces the final energy while keeping the number of orbitals low compared to FCI calculations on an atomic orbital basis set.",

Importantly, this decomposition-based approach is generic, i.e. it does not depend on a specific tensor-network, the tensor index (physical) ordering, or the choice of tensor decomposition. Careful consideration should be made to determine the best decomposition strategy. Furthermore, this method does not rely on robust cancellation of errors (i.e. the Taylor expansion). As a means to study the effectiveness of the approach, we replace the exact contraction of the particle particle ladder (PPL) tensor diagram in the popular coupled-cluster with single and double excitation (CCSD) method with a low-rank tensor decomposition, namely the canonical polyadic decomposition (CPD). With this approach, we replace an $\\mathcal{O}(N^6)$ tensor contractions with a potentially reduced-scaling $\\mathcal{O}(N^4R)$ optimization problem, where $R$ is the CP rank, and we reduce the computational storage of the PPL tensor from $\\mathcal{O}(N^4)$ to $\\mathcal{O}(NR)$, although we do not take advantage of this compression in this study. To minimize the cost of the CPD optimization, we utilize the iterative structure of CCSD to efficiently initialize the CPD optimization. We show that accurate chemically-relevant energy values can be computed with an error of less than 1 kcal/mol using a relatively low CP rank.",

By using a scheme that we propose, a strong symmetry protected topological (SPT) mixed state and double average SPT (ASPT) state are constructed through the pure gapless SPT order and the domain-wall duality. Among them, the double ASPT is categorized by coexisting orders, i.e., a strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking and ASPT defined by the remaining weak and strong symmetries. We make use of the doubled Hilbert space formalism for the construction scheme. We numerically demonstrate the emergence of the two mixed SPT states and find that a phase transition occurs between them tuned by the strength of decoherence. Finally, we discuss the coexistence of SPT and SWSSB in the double SPT state from the view point of symmetrically invertible property, and comment on the classification of ASPT proposed recently. Suitable multiple-decoherence channel applied to SPT states gives a broad possibility to induce rich ASPTs, possessing non-trivial internal entanglement properties from the view of doubled Hilbert space formalism.",

As in the pure-state setting, we find two information-theoretic phases -- a sharp (fuzzy) phase in which an eavesdropper can rapidly (slowly) learn the symmetry charge. However, because the dynamics is noisy, both phases can be simulated efficiently using tensor networks. Indeed, even when the true dynamics is unitary, introducing noise by hand allows an eavesdropper to efficiently learn the symmetry charge from local measurements, as we demonstrate. We identify the fuzzy phase in this setting as a mixed-state phase that exhibits spontaneous strong-to-weak symmetry breaking.",

Among these, Density Matrix Embedding Theory (DMET) is an efficient approach that enforces self-consistency at the level of one-particle reduced density matrices (1-RDMs), facilitating applications across diverse quantum systems. However, conventional DMET is constrained by the requirement that the global 1-RDM (low-level descriptor) be an orthogonal projector, limiting flexibility in bath construction and potentially impeding accuracy in strongly correlated regimes. In this work, we introduce a generalized DMET framework in which the low-level descriptor can be an arbitrary 1-RDM and the bath construction is based on optimizing a quantitative criterion related to the maximal disentanglement between different fragments. This yields an alternative yet controllable bath space construction for generic 1-RDMs, lifting a key limitation of conventional DMET. We demonstrate its consistency with conventional DMET in appropriate limits and exploring its implications for bath construction, downfolding (impurity Hamiltonian construction), low-level solvers, and adaptive fragmentation. We expect that this more flexible framework, which leads to several new variants of DMET, can improve the robustness and accuracy of DMET.",

The results for the ground state energy in the paramagnetic phase are in very good agreement with state-of-the-art results obtained by methods such as density matrix embedded theory (DMET), quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) and others. The leading low temperature behavior of the free energy allows to extract the quasiparticle effective mass, in particular its enhancement near a continuous phase transition into an ordered state.

Most recently, a reinforcement learning approach has been proposed to find efficient contraction orders in tensor networks. Due to the duality between graphical models and tensor networks, we adapt this approach to probabilistic inference in graphical models. Furthermore, we incorporate structure exploitation into the process of finding an optimal order. Currently, the agent's cost function is formulated in terms of intermediate result sizes which are exponential in the number of indices (i.e., random variables). We show that leveraging specific structures during inference allows for introducing compact encodings of intermediate results which can be significantly smaller. By considering the compact encoding sizes for the cost function instead, we enable the agent to explore more efficient contraction orders.

By leveraging PEPS's proficiency in capturing quantum state entanglement and GFMC's efficient parallel architecture, the hybrid method is well-suited for the accurate and efficient treatment of frustrated quantum spin systems. As a benchmark, we applied this approach to study the frustrated $J_1$-$J_2$ Heisenberg model on a square lattice with periodic boundary conditions (PBC).

The optimization is driven by solving the Hartree-Fock equations (HF) with the density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) algorithm on Cartesian grids that are iteratively refined. In contrast to the standard way of tackling the mean-field problem by expressing the molecular orbitals as linear combinations of atomic orbitals (LCAO) our method only requires as much basis functions as there are electrons within the system. Benchmark calculations for atoms and molecules with up to ten electrons show excellent agreement with LCAO calculations with large basis sets supporting the validity of the tensor network approach. Our work therefore offers a promising alternative to well-established HF-solvers and could pave the way to define highly accurate, fully numerical, molecule-adaptive basis sets, which, in the future, could lead to benefits for post-HF calculations.",

We first prove that VQCount improves upon previous work by reducing exponentially the number of samples needed to obtain an approximation within a multiplicative factor of the exact count. Using tensor network simulations, we then study the typical performance of VQCount with shallow circuits on synthetic instances of two #P-hard problems, positive #NAE3SAT and positive #1-in-3SAT. We employ the original quantum approximate optimization algorithm version of QAOA, as well as the Grover-mixer variant which guarantees a uniform solution probability distribution. We observe a tradeoff between QAOA success probability and sampling uniformity, which we exploit to achieve an exponential gain in efficiency over naive rejection sampling.

In the exactly solvable Kitaev honeycomb model, nonmagnetic spin vacancies are known to bind emergent gauge fluxes of the QSL ground state, which in turn become non-Abelian anyons for an infinitesimal magnetic field. Here, we investigate how this approach for stabilizing non-Abelian anyons at spin vacancies extends to a finite magnetic field represented by a proper Zeeman term. Specifically, we use large-scale density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations to compute the vacancy-anyon binding energy as a function of magnetic field for both the ferromagnetic (FM) and antiferromagnetic (AFM) Kitaev models. We find that, while the inclusion of the field weakens anyon binding in both cases, there is a pronounced difference in the finite-field behavior; the binding energy remains finite within the entire QSL phase for the FM Kitaev model but approaches zero already inside this phase for the AFM Kitaev model. To reliably compute a very small binding energy that is three orders of magnitude below the magnetic interaction strength, we also introduce a refined definition for the binding energy and an extrapolation scheme for its accurate extraction through exclusively ground-state properties using DMRG.",

Starting from the limit of weakly interacting squares for small $J/J_{1}$ where a plaquette cross-dimer VBC with long-range singlets is stabilized, we show that with increasing $J/J_{1}$ it transitions to a VBC with resonances over hexagons, the so-called loop-six VBC, which persists across the isotropic point. Interestingly, a generalized version of the pinwheel VBC, earlier reported to be a closely competing state for the isotropic model is energetically stabilized in a sliver of parameter space right beyond the isotropic point. For further increases in $J/J_{1}$, a decorated loop-six VBC occupies an appreciable region of parameter space before transitioning into an imperfect ferrimagnet which finally evolves into a Lieb ferrimagnet. Our characterization of the underlying phases and phase transitions is based on a careful analysis of the energy, magnetization, spin-spin correlations, and bond entanglement entropy.",

These interactions are described by n-th order interatomic force constants (n-IFCs), which can be viewed as high-dimensional tensors correlating the motion of n atoms, or equivalently encoding n-phonon scattering processes in momentum space. Here, we introduce a tensor decomposition to efficiently compress n-IFCs for arbitrary order n. Using tensor learning, we find optimal low-rank approximations of n-IFCs by solving the resulting optimization problem. Our approach reveals the inherent low dimensionality of phonon-phonon interactions and allows compression of the 3 and 4-IFC tensors by factors of up to $10^3-10^4$ while retaining high accuracy in calculations of phonon scattering rates and thermal conductivity. Calculations of thermal conductivity using the compressed n-IFCs achieve a speed-up by nearly three orders of magnitude with >98% accuracy relative to the reference uncompressed solution. These calculations include both 3- and 4-phonon scattering and are shown for a diverse range of materials (Si, HgTe, MgO, TiNiSn and monoclinic ZrO$_2$). In addition to accelerating state-of-the-art thermal transport calculations, the method shown here paves the way for modeling strongly anharmonic materials and higher-order phonon interactions.",

      "abstract": "Random many-body states are both a useful tool to model certain physical systems and an important asset for quantum computation. Realising them, however, generally requires an exponential (in system size) amount of resources. Recent research has presented a way out by showing that one can generate random states, or more precisely a controlled approximation of them, by applying a quantum circuit built in terms of few-body unitary gates. Most of this research, however, has been focussed on the case of quantum circuits composed by completely random unitary gates. Here we consider what happens for circuits that, instead, involve a minimal degree of randomness. Specifically, we concentrate on two different settings: (a) brickwork quantum circuits with a single one-qudit random matrix at a boundary; (b) brickwork quantum circuits with fixed interactions but random one-qudit gates everywhere. We show that, for any given initial state, (a) and (b) produce a distribution of states approaching the Haar distribution in the limit of large circuit depth. More precisely, we show that the moments of the distribution produced by our circuits can approximate the ones of the Haar distribution in a depth proportional to the system size. Interestingly we find that in both Cases (a) and (b) the relaxation to the Haar distribution occurs in two steps - this is in contrast with what happens in fully random circuits. Moreover, we show that choosing appropriately the fixed interactions, for example taking the local gate to be a dual-unitary gate with high enough entangling power, minimally random circuits produce a Haar random distribution more rapidly than fully random circuits. In particular, dual-unitary circuits with maximal entangling power - i.e. perfect tensors - appear to provide the optimal quantum state design preparation for any design number.",

We exploit the scalability of our simulations and simulate a system of over $300$ qubits, allowing us to verify the universal physics present and extract a value for the associated Kibble-Zurek exponent which agrees with recent values obtained in literature. Our results demonstrate that tensor networks are a viable approach for simulating large scale quantum dynamics in two and three dimensions on classical computers, and algorithmic advancements are expected to expand their applicability going forward.",

This problem is DQC1-complete for Markov-closed braids and BQP-complete for Plat-closed braids, and we accommodate both versions of the problem. Even though it is widely believed that DQC1 is strictly contained in BQP, and so is 'less quantum', the resource requirements of classical algorithms for the DQC1 version are at least as high as for the BQP version, and so we potentially gain 'more advantage' by focusing on Markov-closed braids in our exposition. We demonstrate our quantum algorithm on Quantinuum's H2-2 quantum computer and show the effect of problem-tailored error-mitigation techniques. Further, leveraging that the Jones polynomial is a link invariant, we construct an efficiently verifiable benchmark to characterise the effect of noise present in a given quantum processor. In parallel, we implement and benchmark the state-of-the-art tensor-network-based classical algorithms for computing the Jones polynomial. The practical tools provided in this work allow for precise resource estimation to identify near-term quantum advantage for a meaningful quantum-native problem in knot theory.",

Using numerical experiments on the Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology (MNIST) dataset, we show that time-evolving an MPS system modeled as a chain of Rydberg atoms produces high-quality data embeddings with low classical computational overhead. Our findings indicate that exact simulation of quantum dynamics is not necessary for strong machine learning performance; even approximate quantum embeddings can yield competitive results.

Specifically, we apply SEESQC to prepare code states of Tetra-Digit models -- a broad class of long-range entangled stabilizer codes indexed by a four-digit parameter. These models are not rare but encompass Toric Codes across arbitrary dimensions and subsume the X-cube fracton code as special cases. Featuring a hierarchical structure of generalized entanglement renormalization group, many Tetra-Digit models host spatially extended excitations (e.g., loops, membranes, and exotic non-manifold objects) with constrained mobility and deformability, and exhibit system-size-dependent ground state degeneracies that scale exponentially with a polynomial in linear sizes. In this work, we first graphically and algebraically demonstrate quantum circuits for computational basis states, before generalizing to broader cases. Central to this framework is a key ingredient termed the \\emph{seed-entangler} acting on a small number of qubits termed \\textit{seeds}, enabling a systematic scheme to achieve arbitrary code states. Remarkably, the number of available seeds equals the number of logical qubits for the constructed examples, which leaves plenty of room for future investigation in theoretical physics, mathematics and quantum information science. With experimental feasibility via synthetic dimensions in modern quantum simulators, this framework transcends spatial dimensions, bridges liquid and non-liquid states, unifies gapped phases governed by distinct entanglement renormalization group schemes, and offers a pathway toward engineering topological phases and manipulating logical qubits.",

These preliminaries provide readers with the core mathematical tools and concepts necessary for quantum physics and quantum computing applications, bridging the gap between multi-linear algebra and complex quantum systems. Part II explores practical applications of tensor networks in simulating quantum dynamics, with a particular focus on the efficiency they offer for systems of high computational complexity. Key topics include Hamiltonian dynamics, quantum annealing, open system dynamics, and optimization strategies using TN frameworks. A final chapter addresses the emerging role of \"quantum magic\" in tensor networks. It delves into non-stabilizer states and their contribution to quantum computational power beyond classical simulability, featuring methods such as stabilizer-enhanced MPS and the Clifford-dressed TDVP.",

Super-moir\\'e materials push this requirement to the limit, where millions or even billions of sites need to be considered, a requirement beyond the capabilities of conventional methods for interacting systems. Here, we establish a methodology that allows solving correlated states in systems reaching a billion sites, that exploits tensor-network representations of real-space Hamiltonians and self-consistent real-space mean-field equations. Our method combines a tensor-network kernel polynomial method with quantics tensor cross interpolation algorithm, enabling us to solve exponentially large models, including those whose single particle Hamiltonian is too large to be stored explicitly. We demonstrate our methodology with super-moir\\'e systems featuring spatially modulated hoppings, many-body interactions and domain walls, showing that it allows access to self-consistent symmetry broken states and spectral functions of real-space models reaching a billion sites. Our methodology provides a strategy to solve exceptionally large interacting problems, providing a widely applicable strategy to compute correlated super-moir\\'e quantum matter.",

By construction, the new inequalities are saturated by tensor network states, whose structure mimics the corresponding network of connectors. Some tight connectors are furthermore ''fully self-testing'', which implies that the quantum Bell inequalities they generate can only be maximized with such a tensor network state and specific measurement operators (modulo local isometries). We provide large analytic families of tight, fully self-testing connectors that generate $N$-partite quantum Bell inequalities of correlator form for which the ratio between the maximum quantum and classical values increases exponentially with $N$.",

Through a combination of analytical perturbative approaches, exact diagonalization, and density-matrix-renormalization-group simulations, we uncover a rich phase diagram driven by gauge-field-mediated resonant pair hopping and the confinement of single particles. The pair hopping results in a bunching state with superextensive energy and macroscopic particle number fluctuations at strong electric field strengths and weak on-site interactions. The bunching state crosses over into a pair superfluid phase as the on-site interaction increases, characterized by a finite superfluid density and powerlaw-decaying pair correlations. At large on-site interaction strengths and driven by effective interactions induced by the gauge constraint, the superfluid transitions into an incompressible pair Mott insulator phase. At weak field strengths and on-site interactions, we find a plasma-like region, where single bosons exhibit large short-range correlations and the ground state is composed almost equally of states with even and odd local boson occupation. The presence of a bunching state with large number fluctuations, which is difficult to study using classical numerics, motivates experimental realizations in hybrid boson-qubit quantum simulation platforms such as circuit QED, neutral atoms, and trapped ions. Our findings highlight the rich interplay between gauge fields and soft-core bosonic matter.",

There is a growing interest in probing analogs of high energy collision phenomena in lattice gauge theories that can be implemented on current quantum simulators. Motivated by this, we characterize the confined mesons that originate from a local high energy excitation in a particle-conserving 1D $Z_2$ lattice gauge theory. We focus on a simple, experimentally accessible setting that does not require preparation of colliding wavepackets and isolates the effects of gauge field confinement strength and initial state energy on the nature of propagating excitations. We find that the dynamics is characterized by the propagation of a superposition of differently sized mesons. The linear confinement leads to meson size oscillations in time. The average meson size and oscillation frequency are controlled by the strength of the gauge field confinement. At a constant confinement field, the average meson length is controlled by the initial excitation's energy. Higher energies produce longer mesons and their effective mass depends strongly on their size: longer mesons propagate more slowly out of the central excitation. Mesons of different sizes get spatially filtered with time due to different speeds. We show that this phenomenology is a consequence of linear confinement and remains valid in both the strong and weak confinement limit. We present simple explanations of these phenomena supported by exact numerics.",

We study a trimer ladder which shows a middle flat band in the absence of onsite Coulomb interaction. We investigate the quantum phases of the Hubbard model on this geometry using exact diagonalization (ED), density matrix renormalization group (DMRG), and perturbation theory. We construct a quantum phase diagram in the plane of the next-nearest-neighbor hopping parameter $t_2$ and onsite Coulomb interaction $U$, revealing five distinct quantum phases. At low $U$ and moderate to high magnitude of $t_2$, the system exhibits metallic behavior, while at large $U$ and small magnitude of $t_2$, it transitions to a ferrimagnetic insulator phase, similar to those observed in certain trimer materials. In the small $t_2$ limit, the Fermi energy is in the flat band, leading to localization of the electrons within the trimer. At low $U$ and small magnitude of $t_2$, the flat band mechanism favors insulating ferrimagnetism, whereas at large $U$, ferrimagnetic states emerge from singlet dimer formation between neighboring sites of a trimer and an isolated corner spin, which connect ferromagnetically. The insulating cell spin density wave phase displays an up-up-down-down spin configuration due to competing nearest neighbor hopping, $t_1$. Interestingly, in moderate $U$ and $|t_2|>0.3$, the ground state behaves like metallic Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid.",

This non-Hermitian nature introduces significant challenges for variational methods such as the Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG). To address these, existing approaches often rely on computationally expensive methods prone to errors, such as imaginary-time evolution. We introduce an Error-Mitigated Transcorrelated DMRG (EMTC-DMRG), a classical variational algorithm that overcomes these challenges by integrating existing techniques to achieve superior accuracy and efficiency. Key features of our algorithm include: (a) an analytical formulation of the transcorrelated Fermi-Hubbard Hamiltonian; (b) a numerically exact, uncompressed Matrix Product Operator (MPO) representation developed via symbolic optimization and the Hopcroft-Karp algorithm; and (c) a time-independent DMRG with a two-site sweep algorithm; (d) we use Davidson solver even for a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. Our method significantly enhances computational efficiency and accuracy in determining ground-state energies for the two-dimensional transcorrelated Fermi-Hubbard model with periodic boundary conditions.

Specifically, we consider a fermionic mixture where one component experiences a staggered onsite potential and it is coupled through density dependent hopping interactions to the other fermionic component. Crucially, by varying the sign of the staggered potential, we show that this latter fermionic component can acquire topological properties. Thanks to matrix product state simulations, we prove this result both at the equilibrium by extracting the behavior of correlation functions and in an out-of-equilibrium scheme by employing a Thouless charge pumping.

Consequently, we can evaluate ansatz fitness for small systems, which is computationally efficient, while favouring structures that continue to perform well with increasing system size. This ensures that the ansatz captures robust features of the ground state structure. Remarkably, we find analytically tractable ansatzes with a degree of universality, which encode correlations, capture finite-size effects, accurately predict ground-state energies, and offer a good description of critical phenomena. We demonstrate this method on the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model (LMG) and the quantum transverse-field Ising model (TFIM), where the same ansatz was independently generated for both. The simple structure of the ansatz allows us to restore broken symmetries and obtain exact expressions for the expectation values of local observables and correlation functions.",

Recently, the functional tensor network has emerged as a suitable candidate for density estimation due to its ability to calculate the normalization constant exactly, a defining feature not enjoyed by neural network alternatives such as energy-based models or diffusion models. While current functional tensor network models show good performance for lattice models with weak or moderate couplings, we show that they face significant model capacity constraints when applied to lattice models with strong coupling. To address this issue, this work proposes to perform density estimation on the lattice model under a wavelet transformation. Motivated by the literature on scale separation, we perform iterative wavelet coarsening to separate the lattice model into different scales. Based on this multiscale structure, we design a new functional hierarchical tensor ansatz using a hierarchical tree topology, whereby information on the finer scale is further away from the root node of the tree. Our experiments show that the numerical rank of typical lattice models is significantly lower under appropriate wavelet transformation. Furthermore, we show that our proposed model allows one to model challenging Gaussian field models and Ginzburg-Landau models.",

Moreover, we investigate the effect of introducing a controlled number of non-Clifford (magic) resources into Clifford circuits. We show that inserting a polylogarithmic in qudit number of $T$-states is sufficient to drive the overlap distribution toward the Porter-Thomas statistics, effectively recovering full quantum randomness. In short, this fact presents doped tensor networks and shallow Clifford circuits as pseudo-magic quantum states.

In the MPU case, we can define analogous defect tensors, this time sitting on lattice sites, that can be created, moved, and fused by local unitary operators. We leverage this formalism to study the gauging of MPU symmetries. We introduce a condition, block independence, under which we can gauge the symmetries by promoting the symmetry defects to gauge degrees of freedom, yielding an MPS of the same bond dimension that supports a local version of the symmetry given by commuting gauge constraints. Whenever block independence does not hold (which happens, in particular, whenever the symmetry representation is anomalous), a modification of our method which we call state-level gauging still gives rise to a locally symmetric MPS by promotion of the symmetry defects, at the expense of producing gauge constraints that do not commute on different sites.",

      "abstract": "The study of many-body quantum systems out of equilibrium remains a significant challenge with complexity barriers arising in both state and operator-based representations. In this work, we review recent approaches based on finding better contraction strategies for the full spatio-temporal tensor networks that encode the path integral of the dynamics, as well as the conceptual integration of influence functionals, process tensors, and transfer matrices within the tensor network formalism. We discuss recent algorithmic developments, highlight the complexity of influence functionals in various dynamical regimes and present consistent results of different communities, showing how ergodic dynamics render these functionals exponentially difficult to compress. Finally, we provide an outlook on strategies to encode complementary influence functional overlaps, paving the way for accurate descriptions of open and closed quantum systems with tensor networks.",

The tensor networks constructed are one dimension higher than the lattices of the physical systems, allowing entangled physical degrees of freedoms to be paired with one another arbitrarily far away. Contraction rules of the internal legs are specified by a simple translationally invariant set of rules in terms of the tesselation of cubes or prisms in 3D space. The networks directly generalize the previous holographic tensor networks for 1D Fredkin and Motzkin chains.

      "abstract": "Projected entangled-pair states (PEPS) have proven effective in capturing chiral spin liquid ground states, yet the presence of long-range ``gossamer'' correlation tails raises concerns about their ability to accurately describe bulk gaps. Here, we address this challenge and demonstrate that PEPS can reliably characterize gapped bulk excitations in chiral topological phases. Using a variational principle for excited states within a local mode approximation, we establish that correlation functions decaying faster than $r^{-2}$ are not necessarily related to gapless modes and thus long-range ``gossamer'' correlation tails in chiral PEPS do not contradict the presence of a bulk gap. This framework is validated in the spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ Kitaev model with a chiral term, where PEPS yields excitation gaps that agree well with exact solutions. Extending our approach to the $\\mathbb{Z}_3$ Kitaev model, we present compelling evidence for its chiral ground state and accurately resolve its gapped excitations. These findings thus solidify PEPS as a powerful tool for studying both ground and excited states in chiral topological systems, thereby bridging a key gap in the understanding of their bulk properties.",

From a quantum information perspective, the fingerprint of this phenomenon is the logarithmic growth of the entanglement entropy over time. We perform intensive numerical simulations, applied to a paradigmatic model system, showing that the local ergotropy, the maximum extractable work via local unitary operations on a small subsystem in the presence of Hamiltonian coupling, dynamically witnesses the change from ergodic to localized phases. Within the many-body localized phase, both the local ergotropy and its quantum fluctuations slowly vary over time with a characteristic logarithmic law analogous to the behaviour of entanglement entropy. This showcases how directly leveraging local control, instead of local observables or entropies analyzed in previous works, provides a thermodynamic marker of localization phenomena based on the locally extractable work.",

We also derive a non-semisimple version via semisimplification. Our approach relies on the concept of a formal angle, and the extension of key results--such as the planar algebraic exchange relation and Landau's theorems--to linear monoidal categories. Major applications of our findings include a stronger version of the Ino-Watatani result: we show that the finiteness of intermediate C*-algebras holds in a finite-index unital irreducible inclusion of C*-algebras without requiring the simple assumption. Moreover, for a finite-dimensional semisimple Hopf algebra H, we prove that H* is a Frobenius algebra object in Rep(H) and has a finite number of rigid invariant Frobenius subalgebras.

Inexactness stems from low-rank compression, enabling efficient representation of high-dimensional vectors in a low-rank tensor format. A primary challenge in these methods is that standard operations, such as matrix-vector products and linear combinations, increase tensor rank, necessitating rank truncation and hence approximation. The Lanczos method constructs an approximate orthonormal Krylov basis, which is often difficult to represent accurately using low-rank tensor formats, even when the eigenvectors themselves exhibit low-rank structure. In contrast, the low-rank polynomial-filtered subspace iteration uses approximate eigenvectors (Ritz vectors) directly as a subspace basis, bypassing the need for an orthonormal Krylov basis. Our analysis and numerical experiments demonstrate that inexact subspace iteration is much more robust to rank-truncation errors compared to the inexact Lanczos method. We further demonstrate that rank-truncated subspace iteration can converge for problems where the density matrix renormalization group method (DMRG) stagnates.",

      "abstract": "Many quantum many-body wavefunctions, such as Jastrow-Slater, tensor network, and neural quantum states, are studied with the variational Monte Carlo technique, where stochastic optimization is usually performed to obtain a faithful approximation to the ground-state of a given Hamiltonian. While first-order gradient descent methods are commonly used for such optimizations, quasi-second-order optimization formulations offer the potential of faster convergence under certain theoretical conditions, but with a similar cost per sample to first-order methods. However, the relative performance of first-order and second-order optimizers is influenced in practice by many factors, including the sampling requirements for a faithful optimization step, the influence of wavefunction quality, as well as the wavefunction parametrization and expressivity. Here we analyze these performance characteristics of first-order and quasi-second-order optimization methods for a variety of Hamiltonians, with the additional context of understanding the scaling of these methods (for good performance) as a function of system size. Our findings help clarify the role of first-order and quasi-second-order methods in variational Monte Carlo calculations and the conditions under which they should respectively be used. In particular, we find that unlike in deterministic optimization, where closeness to the variational minimum determines the suitability of second-order methods, in stochastic optimization the main factor is the overall expressivity of the wavefunction: quasi-second-order methods lead to an overall reduction in cost relative to first-order methods when the wavefunction is sufficiently expressive to represent the ground-state, even when starting far away from the ground state. This makes quasi-second-order methods an important technique when used with wavefunctions with arbitrarily improvable accuracy.",

After presenting a simple argument showing that long-range nonstabilizerness is a generic property of many-body states, we restrict to the class of ground states of gapped local Hamiltonians. We focus on one-dimensional systems and present rigorous results in the context of translation-invariant matrix product states (MPSs). By analyzing the fixed points of the MPS renormalization-group flow, we provide a sufficient condition for long-range nonstabilizerness, which depends entirely on the local MPS tensors. Physically, our condition captures the fact that the mutual information between distant regions of stabilizer fixed points is quantized, and this fact is not changed after applying shallow quantum circuits.

Our analysis reveals a novel logarithmic correction to the expected entanglement scaling when the system size is odd. This anomaly arises from the geometric frustration of spin configurations imposed by periodic boundary conditions on odd-sized chains. We demonstrate that the scaling prefactor of this logarithmic term is directly related to the compactification radius of the low-energy bosonic field theory description, or equivalently, the Luttinger parameter. Thus, this correction provides a direct probe of the underlying Conformal Field Theory (CFT) describing the critical point.

The models are parametrized using density functional theory, the constrained random phase approximation, and the Rytova-Keldysh form of the long-range Coulomb interaction. Our simulations indicate the emergence of a charge density wave state characterized by cosine-like intra-chain density modulations and inter-chain phase shifts that minimize the Coulomb repulsion. Notably, at a doping level corresponding to $1/n$ electron per CrSBr unit, the most stable pattern exhibits a periodicity of $n$ cells, in agreement with experimental observations and Peierls' instability arguments. Moreover, we demonstrate that the inter-chain order is sensitive to the range of Coulomb interactions.

TNP depends neither on the pre-trained generative model nor the specific dataset, resulting in strong robustness across diverse adversarial scenarios. To this end, the key challenge lies in relaxing Gaussian-noise assumptions of classical decompositions and accommodating the unknown distribution of adversarial perturbations. Unlike the low-rank representation of classical decompositions, TNP aims to reconstruct the unobserved clean examples from an adversarial example. Specifically, TNP leverages progressive downsampling and introduces a novel adversarial optimization objective to address the challenge of minimizing reconstruction error but without inadvertently restoring adversarial perturbations. Extensive experiments conducted on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet demonstrate that our method generalizes effectively across various norm threats, attack types, and tasks, providing a versatile and promising adversarial purification technique.",

      "abstract": "We investigate the efficient combination of the canonical polyadic decomposition (CPD) and tensor hyper-contraction (THC) approaches. We first present a novel low-cost CPD solver which leverages a precomputed THC factorization of an order-$4$ tensor to efficiently optimize the order-$4$ CPD with $\\mathcal{O}(NR^2)$ scaling. With the matrix-free THC-based optimization strategy in hand we can: efficiently generate CPD factorizations of the order-4 two-electron integral tensors; and develop novel electronic structure methods which take advantage of both the THC and CPD approximations. Next, we investigate the application of a combined CPD and THC approximation of the Laplace transform (LT) second-order M{\\o}ller-Plesset (MP2) method. We exploit the ability to switch efficiently between the THC and CPD factorizations of the two electron integrals to reduce the computational complexity of the LT MP2 method while preserving the accuracy of the approach. Furthermore we take advantage of the robust fitting approximation to eliminate leading order error in the CPD approximated tensor networks. Finally, we show that modest values of THC and CPD rank preserve the accuracy of the LT MP2 method and that this CPD+THC LT MP2 strategy realizes a performance advantage over canonical LT MP2 in both computational wall-times and memory resource requirements.",

In our setup, we identify three distinct regimes that qualitatively characterize the evolution: for a dilute medium, the incoming probe state evolves nearly ballistically; in an intermediate setting, it traverses the matter, locally exciting it; and for dense targets, one approaches a black-disk limit, where the matter acts as a strong wall potential. We find evidence that the probe's energy loss rate scales linearly with the path length in the medium, and we study how the entanglement entropy reveals the mixing between the probe and medium states. With the goal of one day replicating high-energy nuclear experiments in quantum devices, we briefly discuss how the current tensor network-based simulations can be translated to a quantum simulator.",

We investigate the unconventional superconductivity in the kagome superconductor $\\mathrm{CsV_3Sb_5}$, focusing on the emergence of charge-$6e$ superconductivity (SC) at temperatures higher than the conventional charge-$2e$ SC state. By modeling the phase coherence of the SC order parameter using a frustrated antiferromagnetic XY model on an emergent kagome lattice, we show that the condensation of fractional vortices with $1/3$ vorticity stabilizes phase coherence in $\\exp(i3\\theta)$, giving rise to the charge-$6e$ SC state. Using a tensor network approach tailored for frustrated spin systems, we identify a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition at $T_c/J \\simeq 0.075$, where the unbinding of $1/3$ fractional vortex-antivortex pairs transforms the system from the charge-$6e$ SC phase to the normal phase. Below $T_c$, the $1/3$ fractional vortex correlations exhibit power-law decay, while the integer vortex correlations decay exponentially, reflecting the dominance of charge-$6e$ SC in the absence of charge-$2e$ SC. Our results provide a theoretical understanding of the charge-$6e$ SC in two-dimensional kagome superconductors, emphasizing the interplay between fractional vortices, frustration, and topology in stabilizing this exotic SC phase.",

We identify the underlying screening process as a novel spin-charge Kondo effect, where the low-energy spin and charge degrees of freedom of the Majorana zero mode-quantum dot subsystem are fully screened by those in the normal lead, resulting in the formation of a spin-charge singlet. An effective low-energy model is derived, with charge fluctuations appropriately accounted for. This spin-charge Kondo effect is found to be consistent with the spin-dependent Andreev/normal boundary conditions induced by the Majorana zero mode. We demonstrate that the anomalous substructure in the spectrum and thermodynamic properties is closely tied to the proportion of the charge component in the screening cloud. The spin-charge screening cloud exhibits scaling behavior analogous to that of traditional Kondo systems, though the sub-leading even-odd effect is subtly modified by the boundary conditions.

In this paper, we explore the capabilities of MPS representations to encode a wide range of functions and images using O(n)-depth circuits without any ancilla qubits, computed with the so-called Matrix Product Disentangler algorithm with tensor network optimisation. We find that MPS-based state preparation enables the efficient encoding of functions up to low-degree piecewise polynomials with accuracy exceeding 99.99% accuracy. We also showcase a novel approach to encoding structured image data based on MPS approximations of the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) representation, which is shown to prepare a 128x128 ChestMNIST image on 14 qubits with fidelity exceeding 99.1% on a circuit with a total depth of just 425 single-qubit rotation and two-qubit CNOT gates.",

Using a rigorous counting argument, we show that the bond dimension of an iPEPS representation exhibits a corner-dependent term that matches the predicted term in gapped continuous systems. Crucially, we find that this correspondence only emerges when averaging over all possible lattice orientations, revealing a fundamental requirement for properly discretizing continuous systems. Our results provide a geometric understanding of entanglement corner laws and establish a direct connection between analytical field theory predictions and the structure of tensor network representations. We extend our analysis to gauge-invariant systems, where lattice corners crossed by the bipartition boundary contribute an additional corner-dependent term.

However, the exponential scaling of the tensor size with quantum memory length of these techniques limits the applicability when applied to systems with long memory times. Here we provide a general optimization of tensor multiplication schemes for systems with pair correlations and finite memory times. This optimization effectively reduces the tensor sizes by using a matrix representation of tensors combined with singular value decomposition to filter out negligible contributions. This approach dramatically reduces both computational time and memory usage of the traditional tensor-multiplication schemes. Calculations that would require over 50 million GB of RAM in the original approach are now available on standard computers, allowing access to new regimes and more complex systems. While more memory-efficient representations exist, this approach enables an extrapolation scheme that other techniques do not offer. As a demonstration, we apply it to the Trotter decomposition with linked cluster expansion technique, and use it to investigate a quantum dot-microcavity system at larger coupling strengths than previously achieved. We also apply the optimization in a case where the memory time is very long -- specifically in a system containing two spatially separated quantum dots in a common phonon bath.",

To show this, we perform quantum simulations of one- and two-dimensional transverse-field Ising models driven from the paramagnetic to the ferromagnetic phase. We utilize superconducting cloud-based quantum processors with up to 156 qubits. Our data reveal that the digitized counterdiabatic protocol reduces defect formation by up to 48% in the fast-quench regime -- an improvement hard to achieve through digitized quantum annealing under current noise levels. The experimental results closely match theoretical and numerical predictions at short evolution times, before deviating at longer times due to hardware noise. In one dimension, we derive an analytic solution for the defect number distribution in the fast-quench limit. For two-dimensional geometries, where analytical solutions are unknown and numerical simulations are challenging, we use advanced matrix-product-state methods. Our findings indicate a practical way to control the topological defect formation during fast quenches and highlight the utility of counterdiabatic protocols for quantum optimization and quantum simulation in material design on current quantum processors.",

      "abstract": "For a quantum many-body spin system undergoing spontaneous symmetry breaking with type-B Goldstone modes, a high degree of degeneracy arises in the ground state manifold. Generically, if this degeneracy is polynomial in system size, then it does not depend on the type of boundary conditions used. However, if there exists an emergent (local) symmetry operation tailored to a specific degenerate ground state, then we show that the degeneracies are exponential in system size and are different under periodic boundary conditions (PBCs) and open boundary conditions (OBCs). We further show that the exponential ground state degeneracies in turn imply the emergence of Goldstone flat bands -- single-mode excitations generated by a multi-site operator and its images under the repeated action of the translation operation under PBCs or the cyclic permutation symmetry operation under OBCs. Conversely, we also show that the presence of emergent Goldstone flat bands implies that there exists an emergent (local) symmetry operation tailored to a specific degenerate ground state. In addition, we propose an extrinsic characterization of emergent Goldstone flat bands, revealing a connection to quantum many-body scars, which violate the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis. We illustrate this by presenting examples from the staggered ${\\rm SU}(4)$ spin-1 ferromagnetic biquadratic model and the staggered ${\\rm SU}(4)$ ferromagnetic spin-orbital model. We also perform extensive numerical simulations for the more general ${\\rm SO}(3)$ spin-1 bilinear-biquadratic and ${\\rm SO(4)}$ ferromagnetic spin-orbital models, containing the two aforementioned models as the endpoints in the ferromagnetic regimes respectively, and confirm the emergence of Goldstone flat bands, as we approach these endpoints from deep inside the ferromagnetic regimes.",

For a specific interaction pattern, the BO phase exhibits topological properties, which vanish when the pattern is altered, leading to a transition from a topological BO phase to a trivial BO phase through a gap-closing point where both interactions vanish.

We demonstrate generally that measurement-induced phase transitions can be viewed as decoherence-induced critical mixed states. In this context, a deeper conceptual understanding is called for with regard to symmetry as an organizing principle. Integrating these connections we investigate the role of self-dual symmetry in mixed states, showing that the decoherence of electric (e) and magnetic (m) vortices from the 2D bulk of the toric code, or equivalently, a 2D cluster state with symmetry-protected topological order, can leave a (1+1)D quantum critical mixed state on the boundary protected by a weak Kramers-Wannier self-dual symmetry. The corresponding self-dual critical bulk is described by the $N\\to1$ limit of the 2D Non-linear Sigma Model in symmetry class D with target space SO(2N)/U(N) at $\\Theta$-angle $\\pi$, and represents a \"measurement-version\" of the Cho-Fisher network model subjected to Born-rule randomness. Explicit breaking of self-duality, by incoherent noise amounting to fermion interactions or (non-interacting) coherent deformation, is shown to induce an RG crossover from this self-dual critical state to Nishimori criticality or to it from a novel type of Ising+ criticality, respectively, both related to the random-bond Ising model in different replica limits. Using an unbiased numerical approach combining tensor network, Monte Carlo, and Gaussian fermion simulations, we chart out a global phase diagram as diagnosed by coherent information and entanglement entropy measures.

When hole-doped, previous numerical simulations revealed that the system exhibits strong binding energies, with a phenomenology resembling a BCS-to-BEC crossover accompanied by a Feshbach resonance between two distinct types of charge carriers. Here, we perform a mean-field analysis that enables a direct observation of the BCS-to-BEC crossover as well as microscopic insights into the crossover region and the pairing symmetry for two-dimensional bilayers. We benchmark our mean-field description by comparing it to density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations in quasi-one dimensional settings and find remarkably good agreement. For the two-dimensional system relevant to LNO our mean-field calculations predict a BCS pairing gap with an extended $s$-wave symmetry, directly resulting from the pairing mechanism's Feshbach-origin. Our analysis hence gives insights into pairing in unconventional superconductors and, further, can be tested in currently available ultracold atom experiments.",

      "abstract": "A complex but important challenge in understanding quantum mechanical phenomena is the simulation of quantum many-body dynamics. Although quantum computers offer significant potential to accelerate these simulations, their practical application is currently limited by noise and restricted scalability. In this work, we address these problems by proposing a hybrid ansatz combining the strengths of quantum and classical computational methods. Using Trotterization, we evolve an initial state on the quantum computer according to a simplified Hamiltonian, focusing on terms that are difficult to simulate classically. A classical model then corrects the simulation by including the terms omitted in the quantum circuit. While the classical ansatz is optimized during the time evolution, the quantum circuit has no variational parameters. Derivatives can thus be calculated purely classically, avoiding challenges arising in the optimization of parameterized quantum circuits. We demonstrate three applications of this hybrid method. First, our approach allows us to avoid SWAP gates in the quantum circuit by restricting the quantum part of the ansatz to hardware-efficient terms of the Hamiltonian. Second, we can mitigate errors arising from the Trotterization of the time evolution unitary. Finally, we can extend the system size while keeping the number of qubits on the quantum device constant by including additional degrees of freedom in the classical ansatz.",

This is especially true for the superconductor-semiconductor heterostructures used to build Majorana-based topological qubits, where quantitatively understanding the interplay of topological superconductivity, disorder, semiconductor quantum dots, Coulomb blockade and noise has been essential for progress on device design and interpretation of measurements. In this paper, we describe a general framework to simulate the low-energy quantum dynamics of such complex systems. We illustrate our approach by computing the dispersive gate sensing (DGS) response of quantum dots coupled to topological superconductors. We start by formulating the DGS response as an open-system quantum dynamics problem, which allows a consistent treatment of drive backaction as well as quantum and classical noise. For microscopic quantum problems subject to Coulomb-blockade, where a direct solution in the exponentially large many-body Hilbert space would be prohibitive, we introduce a series of controlled approximations that incorporate ideas from tensor network theory and quantum chemistry to reduce this Hilbert space to a few low-energy degrees of freedom that accurately capture the low-energy quantum dynamics. We demonstrate the methods introduced in this paper on the example of a single quantum dot coupled to a topological superconductor and a microscopic realization of the fermion parity readout setup of Aghaee et al. arXiv:2401.09549 (2024).",

      "abstract": "Global discrete optimization is notoriously difficult due to the lack of gradient information and the curse of dimensionality, making exhaustive search infeasible. Tensor cross approximation is an efficient technique to approximate multivariate tensors (and discretized functions) by tensor product decompositions based on a small number of tensor elements, evaluated on adaptively selected fibers of the tensor, that intersect on submatrices of (nearly) maximum volume. The submatrices of maximum volume are empirically known to contain large elements, hence the entries selected for cross interpolation can also be good candidates for the globally maximal element within the tensor. In this paper we consider evolution of epidemics on networks, and infer the contact network from observations of network nodal states over time. By numerical experiments we demonstrate that the contact network can be inferred accurately by finding the global maximum of the likelihood using tensor cross interpolation. The proposed tensor product approach is flexible and can be applied to global discrete optimization for other problems, e.g. discrete hyperparameter tuning.",

The construction of infinite-dimensional MPS (idMPS) is analogous to the well-known finite-dimensional construction in terms of singular value decompositions of matrices.

      "abstract": "A classical impurity spin coupled to the spinful Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) chain is known to exhibit complex switching dynamics with incomplete spin relaxation. Here, we study the corrections that result from a full quantum treatment of the impurity spin. We find that in the topologically trivial case, the quantum spin behaves similarly to the classical one due to the absence of the Kondo effect for the trivial insulator. In the topological case, the quantum spin is significantly less likely to relax: It can be stuck at a pre-relaxation plateau with a sizable deviation from the expected relaxed value, and there is a large parameter regime where it does not relax at all but features an anomalously large Larmor frequency. Furthermore, we find an additional quantum effect where the pre-relaxation plateau can be hyperpolarized, i.e., the spin is stuck at a polarization value larger than the ground-state expectation value. This is possible due to the (incomplete) Kondo screening of the quantum spin, which is absent in the classical case. Our results are obtained via the ground state density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) algorithm and the time-dependent variational principle (TDVP), where the charge-SU(2) symmetry of the problem was exploited. Furthermore, we introduce and benchmark a method to predict the dynamics from the given numerical data based on the sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy). This allows us to prolong the simulation timescale by a factor of 2.5, up to a maximal time of $10^3$ inverse hoppings.",

Here, we investigate the impact of electron-electron interactions and perturbations in the coherence of the driving on the lifetime of FBs by directly computing time-dependent single-particle spectral functions using exact diagonalization (ED) and matrix product states (MPS). We study interacting metallic and correlated insulating phases in a chain of correlated spinless fermions. At high-frequency driving we obtain clearly separated, long-lived FBs of the full many-body excitation continuum. However, if there is significant overlap of the features, which is more probable in the low-frequency regime, the interactions lead to strong heating, which results in a significant loss of quantum coherence and of the FBs. Similar suppression of FBs is obtained in the presence of noise. The emerging picture is further elucidated by the behavior of real-space single-particle propagators, of the energy gain, and of the momentum distribution function, which is related to a quantum Fisher information that is directly accessible by spectroscopic measurements.",

This paper proposes a completely back-propagation-free (BP-free) and highly salable framework for training real-size PINNs on silicon photonic platforms. Our approach involves three key innovations: (1) a sparse-grid Stein derivative estimator to avoid the BP in the loss evaluation of a PINN, (2) a dimension-reduced zeroth-order optimization via tensor-train decomposition to achieve better scalability and convergence in BP-free training, and (3) a scalable on-chip photonic PINN training accelerator design using photonic tensor cores. We validate our numerical methods on both low- and high-dimensional PDE benchmarks.

We address this question in two main contributions. First, we introduce an improved variant of isometric network states (isoTNS) in two dimensions, where the isometric arrows on the columns of the network alternate between pointing upward and downward, hence the name alternating isometric tensor network states. Second, we introduce a numerical tool -- isometric Gaussian fermionic TNS (isoGfTNS) -- that incorporates isometric constraints into the framework of Gaussian fermionic tensor network states. We demonstrate in numerous ways that alternating isoTNS represent many-body ground states of two-dimensional quantum systems significantly better than the original isoTNS. First, we show that the entanglement in an isoTNS is mediated along the isometric arrows and that alternating isoTNS mediate entanglement more efficiently than conventional isoTNS. Second, alternating isoTNS correspond to a deeper, thus more representative, sequential circuit construction of depth $\\mathcal{O}(L_x \\cdot L_y)$ compared to the original isoTNS of depth $\\mathcal{O}(L_x + L_y)$. Third, using the Gaussian framework and gradient-based energy minimization, we provide numerical evidences of better bond-dimension scaling and variational energy of alternating isoGfTNS for ground states of various free fermionic models, including the Fermi surface, the band insulator, and the $p_x + ip_y$ mean-field superconductor. Finally, we find improved performance of alternating isoTNS as compared to the original isoTNS for the ground state energy of the (interacting) transverse field Ising model.",

Moreover, the utilisation of sophisticated numerical tools, such as the matrix product states (MPSs) and the discretization approach, enables the efficient simulation of multi-photon dynamics, in which the non-Markovian Floquet steady states emerge. This work fundamentally broadens the fields of collective emission, and has wide applications in implementing frequency-encoded quantum information processing and many-body quantum simulation.",

      "abstract": "We introduce a methodology to estimate non-stabilizerness or \"magic\", a key resource for quantum complexity, with Neural Quantum States (NQS). Our framework relies on two schemes based on Monte Carlo sampling to quantify non-stabilizerness via Stabilizer R\\'enyi Entropy (SRE) in arbitrary variational wave functions. When combined with NQS, this approach is effective for systems with strong correlations and in dimensions larger than one, unlike Tensor Network methods. Firstly, we study the magic content in an ensemble of random NQS, demonstrating that neural network parametrizations of the wave function capture finite non-stabilizerness besides large entanglement. Secondly, we investigate the non-stabilizerness in the ground state of the $J_1$-$J_2$ Heisenberg model. In 1D, we find that the SRE vanishes at the Majumdar-Ghosh point $J_2 = J_1/2$, consistent with a stabilizer ground state. In 2D, a dip in the SRE is observed near maximum frustration around $J_2/J_1 \\approx 0.6$, suggesting a Valence Bond Solid between the two antiferromagnetic phases.",

This work proposes a novel lifting method for approximately solving TC regression problems using structured TD regression algorithms as blackbox subroutines, enabling sublinear-time methods. We analyze the convergence rate of our approximate Richardson iteration-based algorithm, and our empirical study shows that it can be 100x faster than direct methods for CP completion on real-world tensors.",

      "abstract": "Quantum feedback control is a technique for controlling quantum dynamics by applying control inputs to the quantum system based on the results of measurements performed on the system. It is an important technique from both an applied and a fundamental theoretical point of view. There are two fundamental inequalities that describe trade-off relations in quantum mechanics, namely, the quantum speed limit and the quantum thermodynamic uncertainty relation. They characterize the operational limit of non-equilibrium quantum systems, making them essential for controlling such systems. Therefore, it is meaningful to formulate these trade-off relations within the framework of quantum feedback control. In this paper, we derive these inequalities based on the continuous matrix product state method. Additionally, we analytically derive the exact form of quantum dynamical activity under feedback control, which serves as the cost term in these inequalities. Specifically, we focus on the cases of Markovian feedback, i.e., the direct feedback of continuous measurement results. Our numerical analysis reveals that the presence of feedback control can improve the quantum speed limit time and the quality of continuous measurements. Furthermore, the relationship with quantum error correction, an important application of quantum feedback control, is discussed using numerical simulations. Thus, our work clarifies how feedback control affects these important trade-off relationships in quantum mechanics.",

The time-dependent density is obtained in the spirit of the Bogolyubov approach by calculating theoretically the equations of motion associated to the relevant quadratic bosonic correlators. In the one-dimensional case, our results compare very well with quasi-exact numerical calculations based on the quantum jump method implemented using tensor networks. We find that the intermediate-time dynamics of the density displays an algebraic decay characterized by an interaction-dependent power-law exponent. The latter property still holds for long-range two-body loss processes but it is absent in the two-dimensional square lattice with on-site losses.",

For a long time it was known as an oxidation catalyst, with its physical properties being discrepant and confusing, until a decade ago when its allotropic form $\\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ rose to exceptional prominence. This \"re-discovery\" of $\\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ has not only reshaped the hunt for a material manifestation of the Kitaev spin liquid, but it has opened the floodgates of theoretical and experimental research in the many unusual phases and excitations that the anisotropic-exchange magnets as a class of compounds have to offer. Given its importance for the field of Kitaev materials, it is astonishing that the low-energy spin model that describes this compound and its possible proximity to the much-desired spin-liquid state is still a subject of significant debate ten years later. In the present study, we argue that the existing key phenomenological observations put strong natural constraints on the effective microscopic spin model of $\\alpha$-RuCl$_3$, and specifically on its spin-orbit-induced anisotropic-exchange parameters that are responsible for the non-trivial physical properties of this material. These constraints allow one to focus on the relevant region of the multi-dimensional phase diagram of the $\\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ model, suggest an intuitive description of it via a different parametrization of the exchange matrix, offer a unifying view on the earlier assessments of its parameters, and bring closer together several approaches to the derivation of anisotropic-exchange models. We explore extended phase diagrams relevant to the $\\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ parameter space using quasi-classical, Luttinger-Tisza, exact diagonalization, and density-matrix renormalization group methods, demonstrating a remarkably c...

Using tensor-network simulations, we observe oscillatory behavior of local expectation values and bipartite entanglement entropy. We explain these oscillations deep in the many-body localized spin glass regime via a simple theoretical model. From perturbation theory, we predict the timescales up to which our analytical description is valid and confirm it with numerical simulations. Finally, we study the correlation length dynamics, which, after a long-time plateau, resumes growing in line with renormalization group (RG) expectations.

In these setups, defects arise naturally due to various imperfections and can significantly modify the theoretical predictions compared to an ideal model. Here, we investigate the impact of geometric defects in the simplest situation -- a one-dimensional Rydberg atom array, both at and away from its emergent Ising criticality. In the presence of defects, we demonstrate that relevant physical quantities can be extracted from one-point correlation functions. At the critical point, we show that different types of kinks yield distinct outcomes corresponding to their respective spatial-internal symmetries: site-centered kinks can effectively break the array at the kink position regardless of the kink angle, while bond-centered kinks lead to interesting intermediate-coupling fixed points. In the latter case, due to a special renormalization group flow trajectory, the whole system can appear ordered if the system is not large enough. Additionally, away from criticality, the bond-centered kink induces a localization-delocalization transition of the domain wall, characteristic of quantum wetting. These findings highlight the utility of kinks as experimental probes and stress the importance of controlling defects so that experimental observations remain faithful to the pristine model.",

Physics-informed machine learning has found considerable success in exploiting large datasets taken from direct numerical simulation of Navier-Stokes to improve models for the evolution of the VGT. In this work, we follow the long line of blending physical insight with data analysis to simultaneously advance both the modeling and understanding of the phenomenology of the VGT.

This approach can be seen as a new type of regularization for quantum field theories, which we refer to as qubit regularization. A related finite-dimensional regularization, known as the D-theory approach, was proposed long ago as a general framework for all quantum field theories. In this framework, the dimensionality of the local Hilbert space at each spatial point can increase as needed through an additional flavor index. To reproduce asymptotically free QFTs, most studies assume that qubit-regularized theories require extending the local Hilbert space to infinity. However, contrary to this common belief, recent discoveries in (1+1) dimensions have revealed two examples where asymptotic freedom appears to emerge within a strictly finite-dimensional local Hilbert space through a novel renormalization group (RG) flow. These findings motivate further investigation into whether asymptotically free gauge theories could also emerge within a strictly finite-dimensional local Hilbert space. To support these explorations, we propose an orthonormal basis called the monomer-dimer-tensor-network (MDTN) basis and use it to construct new types of qubit-regularized lattice gauge theories.",

Adding quantum fluctuations, which induce dynamics between these different classical ground states, can give rise to quantum spin liquids (QSLs). QSLs are highly entangled quantum phases of matter characterized by fascinating emergent properties, such as fractionalized excitations and topological order. One such exotic quantum liquid is the $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ QSL, which can be regarded as a resonating valence bond (RVB) state formed from superpositions of dimer coverings of an underlying lattice. In this work, we unveil a \\textit{hidden} large-scale structural property of archetypal CSLs and QSLs known as hyperuniformity, i.e., normalized infinite-wavelength density fluctuations are completely suppressed in these systems. In particular, we first demonstrate that classical ensembles of close-packed dimers and their corresponding quantum RVB states are perfectly hyperuniform in general. Subsequently, we focus on a ruby-lattice spin liquid that was recently realized in a Rydberg-atom quantum simulator, and show that the QSL remains effectively hyperuniform even in the presence of a finite density of spinon and vison excitations, as long as the dimer constraint is still largely preserved. Moreover, we demonstrate that metrics based on the framework of hyperuniformity can be used to distinguish the QSL from other proximate quantum phases. These metrics can help identify potential QSL candidates, which can then be further analyzed using more advanced, computationally-intensive quantum numerics to confirm their status as true QSLs.",

      "abstract": "Optimization is a crucial task in various industries such as logistics, aviation, manufacturing, chemical, pharmaceutical, and insurance, where finding the best solution to a problem can result in significant cost savings and increased efficiency. Tensor networks (TNs) have gained prominence in recent years in modeling classical systems with quantum-inspired approaches. More recently, TN generative-enhanced optimization (TN-GEO) has been proposed as a strategy which uses generative modeling to efficiently sample valid solutions with respect to certain constraints of optimization problems. Moreover, it has been shown that symmetric TNs (STNs) can encode certain constraints of optimization problems, thus aiding in their solution process. In this work, we investigate the applicability of TN- and STN-GEO to an industry relevant problem class, a multi-knapsack problem, in which each object must be assigned to an available knapsack. We detail a prescription for practitioners to use the TN-and STN-GEO methodology and study its scaling behavior and dependence on its hyper-parameters. We benchmark 60 different problem instances and find that TN-GEO and STN-GEO produce results of similar quality to simulated annealing.",

The resulting hybrid format has one tensor train for each spatial cell and each time step. We adapt a MUSCL scheme to this hybrid format and show the feasibility of the approach using several classical test cases. A convergence study is done on the Burgers' equation with three stochastic parameters.

In the absence of the interaction, the eigenstates are localized for the system's sizes larger than the localization length. We present several analytical expressions for the localization length, which is proportional to the inverse of the electric field. Using the density matrix renormalization group numerical technique, we observe that the ground state exhibits a decrease of the occupation on the chain sites from the `bulk', with occupation 1, to the vacuum, with occupation 0. The width of this intermediate `edge' region is also inversely proportional to the electric field, increasing linearly with the strength of the nearest-neighbor repulsion. For strong interactions, the occupations in the intermediate region exhibit a charge density wave. We also present the local density of states for sites in the `edge' region. For the non-interacting case, the spectrum shows an increasing energy-localized structure as the field is increased, which is a consequence of the uniform energy distribution of the localized states (Wannier-Stark ladder). This structure survives for small interactions, and it smears out in the strongly interacting limit. Experimental variations of the slope of the potential (the electric field) on cold atom chains may test these predictions.",

In stark contrast, the Page curve dynamics of black hole physics shows that the entropy peaks at the Page time $t_{\\text{Page}}$ and then decreases to zero. Here, we investigate such Page-like behavior of the von Neumann entropy in a model of strongly correlated spinless fermions in a typical system-environment setup, and characterize the properties of the Page curve dynamics in the presence of interactions using numerically exact matrix product states methods. The two phases of growth, namely the linear growth and the bending down, are shown to be separated by a non-analyticity in the min-entropy before $t_{\\text{Page}}$, which separates two different quantum phases, realized as the respective ground states of the corresponding entanglement (or equivalently, modular) Hamiltonian. We confirm and generalize, by introducing interactions, the findings of \\href{https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.109.224308}{Phys. Rev.

      "abstract": "A quantum processing unit (QPU) must contain a large number of high quality qubits to produce accurate results for problems at useful scales. In contrast, most scientific and industry classical computation workloads happen in parallel on distributed systems, which rely on copying data across multiple cores. Unfortunately, copying quantum data is theoretically prohibited due to the quantum non-cloning theory. Instead, quantum circuit cutting techniques cut a large quantum circuit into multiple smaller subcircuits, distribute the subcircuits on parallel QPUs and reconstruct the results with classical computing. Such techniques make distributed hybrid quantum computing (DHQC) a possibility but also introduce an exponential classical co-processing cost in the number of cuts and easily become intractable. This paper presents TensorQC, which leverages classical tensor networks to bring an exponential runtime advantage over state-of-the-art parallelization post-processing techniques. As a result, this paper demonstrates running benchmarks that are otherwise intractable for a standalone QPU and prior circuit cutting techniques. Specifically, this paper runs six realistic benchmarks using QPUs available nowadays and a single GPU, and reduces the QPU size and quality requirements by more than $10\\times$ over purely quantum platforms.",

A notable mechanism of such nonergodicity is the Hilbert space fragmentation (HSF), where the Hamiltonian matrix splits into an exponentially large number of sectors due to the presence of nontrivial conserved quantities. Using ultracold gases, here we experimentally investigate the one-dimensional Bose-Hubbard system with neither disorder nor tilt potential, which has been predicted to exhibit HSF caused by a strong interatomic interaction. Specifically, we analyze far-from-equilibrium dynamics starting from a charge-density wave of doublons (atoms in doubly occupied sites) in a singlon and doublon-resolved manner to reveal a slowing-down of the relaxation in a strongly interacting regime. We find that the numbers of singlons and doublons are conserved during the dynamics, indicating HSF as a mechanism of the observed slow relaxation. Our results provide an experimental confirmation of the conserved quantities responsible for HSF.",

The optimal tensor network structure for a given data tensor depends on both data characteristics and specific optimality criteria, making tensor network structure search a difficult problem. Existing solutions typically rely on sampling and compressing numerous candidate structures; these procedures are computationally expensive and therefore limiting for practical applications. We address this challenge by viewing tensor network structure search as a program synthesis problem and introducing an efficient constraint-based assessment method that avoids costly tensor decomposition. Specifically, we establish a correspondence between transformation programs and network structures. We also design a novel operation named output-directed splits to reduce the search space without hindering expressiveness. We then propose a synthesis algorithm to identify promising network candidates through constraint solving, and avoid tensor decomposition for all but the most promising candidates. Experimental results show that our approach improves search speed by up to $10\\times$ and achieves compression ratios $1.5\\times$ to $3\\times$ better than state-of-the-art. Notably, our approach scales to larger tensors that are unattainable by prior work. Furthermore, the discovered topologies generalize well to similar data, yielding compression ratios up to $ 2.4\\times$ better than a generic structure while the runtime remains around $110$ seconds.",

      "abstract": "Monitored many-body systems can exhibit a phase transition between entangling and disentangling dynamical phases by tuning the strength of measurements made on the system as it evolves. This phenomenon is called the measurement-induced phase transition (MIPT). Understanding the properties of the MIPT is a prominent challenge for both theory and experiment at the intersection of many-body physics and quantum information. Realizing the MIPT experimentally is particularly challenging due to the postselection problem, which demands a number of experimental realizations that grows exponentially with the number of measurements made during the dynamics. Proposed approaches that circumvent the postselection problem typically rely on a classical decoding process that infers the final state based on the measurement record. But the complexity of this classical process generally also grows exponentially with the system size unless the dynamics is restricted to a fine-tuned set of unitary operators. In this work we overcome these difficulties. We construct a tree-shaped quantum circuit whose nodes are Haar-random unitary operators followed by weak measurements of tunable strength. For these circuits, we show that the MIPT can be detected without postselection using only a simple classical decoding process whose complexity grows linearly with the number of qubits. Our protocol exploits the recursive structure of tree circuits, which also enables a complete theoretical description of the MIPT, including an exact solution for its critical point and scaling behavior. We experimentally realize the MIPT on Quantinuum's H1-1 trapped-ion quantum computer and show that the experimental results are precisely described by theory. Our results close the gap between analytical theory and postselection-free experimental observation of the MIPT.",

In this work, we establish a simple and efficient necessary and sufficient condition for a tensor $M$ to generate an MPU of size $N$, given by $\\operatorname{Tr}(\\mathbb{E}_M^N) = \\operatorname{Tr}(\\mathbb{E}_T^N) = 1$, where $\\mathbb{E}_M$ and $\\mathbb{E}_T$ are the transfer matrices of $M$ and $T = MM^\\dagger$. This condition provides a unified framework for characterizing all uniform MPUs and significantly simplifies their evaluation. Furthermore, we show that locality preservation naturally arises when the MPU is generated for all system sizes. Our results offer new insights into the structure of MPUs, highlighting connections between unitary evolution, transfer matrices, and locality-preserving behavior, with potential extensions to higher-dimensions.",

By replacing the dynamical map of a large fermionic quantum environment with an effective semi-group influence matrix (SGIM) which acts on a reduced auxiliary space, we overcome the limitations of previous proposals, achieving high accuracy at long evolution times. This SGIM corresponds to a uniform matrix-product state representation of the influence matrix and can be obtained by an efficient algorithm presented in this paper. We benchmark this approach by computing the spectral function of the single impurity Anderson model with high resolution. Further, the spectrum of the effective dynamical map allows us to obtain relaxation rates of the impurity towards equilibrium following a quantum quench. Finally, for a quantum impurity model with on-site two-fermion loss, we compute the spectral function and confirm the emergence of Kondo physics at large loss rates.",

Our results show that VeloxQ not only matches but often surpasses the mentioned solvers in solution quality and runtime. Additionally, VeloxQ demonstrates excellent scalability being the only solver capable of solving large-scale optimization problems, including up to $2\\times 10^{8}$ sparsely connected variables, that are currently intractable for its competitors.

However, the barren plateau problem, where the gradient of the loss function becomes exponentially small with system size, hinders this goal. Recent studies suggest that embedding tensor networks into quantum circuits and initializing the parameters can avoid the barren plateau. Yet, embedding tensor networks into quantum circuits is generally difficult, and methods have been limited to the simplest structure, Matrix Product States (MPSs). This study proposes a method to embed Tree Tensor Networks (TTNs), characterized by their hierarchical structure, into shallow quantum circuits. TTNs are suitable for representing two-dimensional systems and systems with long-range correlations, which MPSs are inadequate for representing. Our numerical results show that embedding TTNs provides better initial quantum circuits than MPS. Additionally, our method has a practical computational complexity, making it applicable to a wide range of TTNs. This study is expected to extend the application of VQAs to two-dimensional systems and those with long-range correlations, which have been challenging to utilize.",

Using tensor-network contraction and optimization techniques, the model learns an efficient representation of the target distribution, capable of capturing complex correlations with a compact parameterization. Despite their promise, the optimization of TNBMs presents several challenges. A key bottleneck of TNBMs is the logarithmic nature of the loss function commonly used for this problem. The single-tensor logarithmic optimization problem cannot be solved analytically, necessitating an iterative approach that slows down convergence and increases the risk of getting trapped in one of many non-optimal local minima. In this paper, we present an improved second-order optimization technique for TNBM training, which significantly enhances convergence rates and the quality of the optimized model. Our method employs a modified Newton's method on the manifold of normalized states, incorporating regularization of the loss landscape to mitigate local minima issues. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by training a one-dimensional matrix product state (MPS) on both discrete and continuous datasets, showcasing its advantages in terms of stability and efficiency, and demonstrating its potential as a robust and scalable approach for optimizing quantum-inspired generative models.",

We develop a generic scheme to study an analogous situation for three-dimensional fracton phases by means of isometric tensor network states (isoTNS) with finite bond dimension, which allow us to tune phase transitions between different symmetry fractionalization patterns. We focus on the X-Cube model, a paradigmatic fracton model hosting two types of excitations: lineons, which are mobile in a single direction only, and fractons that are immobile on their own. By deforming the local tensors of the fixed point ground state, we find a family of exact wavefunctions for which the symmetry fractionalization under an anti-unitary symmetry on both types of excitations is directly visible. These wavefunctions are non-stabilizer states and have non-vanishing correlation lengths. They even exhibit power-law correlations at criticality between two symmetry-enriched topological orders. Furthermore, the isoTNS description allows for the explicit construction of a linear-depth quantum circuit to sequentially realize these exotic 3D states on a quantum processor, including a holographic scheme using only a pair of two-dimensional qubit arrays alongside measurements. Our approach provides a construction to enrich phases with exotic topological or fracton order and to study 3D quantum phase transition with exact wavefunctions, and offers a tractable route to implement and characterize fracton order on quantum devices.",

Moreover, in the average case for large, random circuits, LOE and magic monotones approximately coincide. Our results imply that an operator evolution that is expensive to simulate using tensor network methods must also be inefficient using both stabilizer and Pauli truncation methods.

This phenomenon is characterized by the spontaneous symmetry breaking of discrete time-translation and provides a rich playground to study a fundamental question in statistical physics: what mechanism allows for driven quantum systems to exhibit emergent behavior that deviates from their counterparts with time-independent evolution? Unlike equilibrium phases, DTCs exhibit macroscopic manifestations of coherent quantum dynamics, challenging the conventional narrative that thermodynamic behavior universally erases quantum signatures. However, due to the difficulty of simulating these systems with either classical or quantum computers, previous studies have been limited to a set of models with Ising-like couplings -- and mostly only in one dimension -- thus precluding our understanding of the existence (or not) of DTCs in models with interactions that closely align with what occurs in nature. In this work, by combining the latest generation of IBM quantum processors with state-of-the-art tensor network methods, we are able to demonstrate the existence of a DTC in a two-dimensional system governed by anisotropic Heisenberg interactions. Our comprehensive analysis reveals a rich phase diagram encompassing spin-glass, ergodic, and time-crystalline phases, highlighting the tunability of these phases through multiple control parameters. Crucially, our results emphasize the interplay of initialization, interaction anisotropy, and driving protocols in stabilizing the DTC phase. By extending the study of Floquet matter beyond simplified models, we lay the groundwork for exploring how driven systems bridge the gap between quantum coherence and emergent non-equilibrium thermodynamics.",

However, simulating open quantum systems, which feature complex non-unitary dynamics, poses significant computational challenges that require innovative methods to overcome. In this work, we introduce the tensor jump method (TJM), a scalable, embarrassingly parallel algorithm for stochastically simulating large-scale open quantum systems, specifically Markovian dynamics captured by Lindbladians. This method is built on three core principles where, in particular, we extend the Monte Carlo wave function (MCWF) method to matrix product states, use a dynamic time-dependent variational principle (TDVP) to significantly reduce errors during time evolution, and introduce what we call a sampling MPS to drastically reduce the dependence on the simulation's time step size. We demonstrate that this method scales more effectively than previous methods and ensures convergence to the Lindbladian solution independent of system size, which we show both rigorously and numerically. Finally, we provide evidence of its utility by simulating Lindbladian dynamics of XXX Heisenberg models up to a thousand spins using a consumer-grade CPU. This work represents a significant step forward in the simulation of large-scale open quantum systems, with the potential to enable discoveries across various domains of quantum physics, particularly those where the environment plays a fundamental role, and to both dequantize and facilitate the development of more stable quantum hardware.",

Here we investigate this question in the setting of cubic-lattice classical Ising spin glasses, where recent theoretical and experimental developments open the possibility of showing quantum speedup with quantum annealing, and where classical time-complexity results remain absent. For the subsystem-based approach we introduce a very simple deterministic tensor-network heuristic that features linear time and space complexity for approximate optimization of the full problem. For the full-system approach we use simulated annealing and parallel tempering. For the most rugged instances generated with tile planting on system sizes up to 56$\\times$56$\\times$56, we find that full-system simulated annealing and full-system parallel tempering display a slightly superlinear time complexity when targeting the same energy error achieved by the subsystem-based linear-time heuristic. We also find that the error of the latter heuristic monotonically decreases with increasing ruggedness over the higher end of the ruggedness spectrum. These results suggest that subsystem-based classical optimization heuristics should be taken into account when seeking to demonstrate quantum speedup on rugged energy landscapes. We discuss prospects for reducing the error of our heuristic, for adapting our heuristic to arbitrary graphs, and for low-power, accelerated implementations with photonic matrix-multiplication hardware.",

This work addresses this challenge by performing a particle-based high-dimensional parametric density estimation subroutine, and the input to the subroutine is Gibbs samples generated by leveraging advanced sampling techniques. Specifically, to generate Gibbs samples, we employ ensemble-based annealed importance sampling, a population-based approach for sampling multimodal distributions. These samples are then processed using functional hierarchical tensor sketching, a tensor-network-based density estimation method for high-dimensional distributions, to obtain the numerical representation of the Gibbs distribution. We successfully apply the proposed approach to complex Ginzburg-Landau models with hundreds of variables. In particular, we show that the approach proposed is successful at addressing the metastability issue under difficult numerical cases.",

When the ratio of boundary to bulk coupling exceeds a critical value of $\\sqrt{2}$, a massive boundary-bound mode is exponentially localized near the impurity site for strong impurity coupling.

By leveraging these tensor network operators, we compute the non-trivial interplay between symmetry-twisted boundary conditions and charge sectors under the duality operation, enabling us to construct isometries relating the dual Hamiltonians.

A more appealing approach for simulating quantum computers is adopting the tensor network approach, whose memory requirements fundamentally depend on the level of entanglement in the quantum circuit, and allows simulating the current largest quantum computers. This work investigates and evaluates the CUDA-Q tensor network simulators on an Nvidia Grace Hopper system, particularly the Matrix Product State (MPS) formulation. We compare the performance of the CUDA-Q state vector implementation and validate the correctness of MPS simulations.

      "abstract": "Numerical methods based on tensor networks have been extensively explored in the research of quantum many-body systems in recent years. It has been recognized that the ability of tensor networks to describe a quantum many-body state crucially depends on the spatial structure of the network. In the previous work, we proposed an algorithm based on tree tensor networks (TTNs) that automatically optimizes the structure of TTN according to the spatial profile of entanglement in the state of interest. In this paper, we precisely analyze how detailed updating schemes in the structural optimization algorithm affect its computational accuracy for the random XY-exchange model under random magnetic fields and the Richardson model. We then find that for the random XY model, on the one hand, the algorithm achieves improved accuracy, and the stochastic algorithm, which selects the local network structure probabilistically, is notably effective. For the Richardson model, on the other hand, the resulting numerical accuracy subtly depends on the initial TTN and the updating schemes. In particular, the algorithm without the stochastic updating scheme certainly improves the accuracy, while the one with the stochastic updates results in poor accuracy due to the effect of randomizing the network structure at the early stage of the calculation. These results indicate that the algorithm successfully improves the accuracy of the numerical calculations for quantum many-body states, while it is essential to appropriately choose the updating scheme as well as the initial TTN structure, depending on the systems treated.",

Simulation tools are essential for quantitatively modelling these effects, yet unless artificial restrictions are placed on the circuit or noise model, accurately modelling noisy quantum computations is an extremely challenging task due to unfavourable scaling of required computational resources. Tensor network methods offer a viable solution for simulating computations that generate limited entanglement or that have noise models which yield low gate fidelities. However, in the most interesting regime of entangling circuits (with high gate fidelities) relevant for error correction and mitigation tensor network simulations often achieve poor accuracy. In this work we develop and numerically test a method for significantly improving the accuracy of tensor network simulations of noisy quantum circuits in the low-noise (i.e. high gate-fidelity) regime. Our method comes with the advantages that it (i) allows for the simulation of quantum circuits under generic types of noise model, (ii) is especially tailored to the low-noise regime, and (iii) retains the benefits of tensor network scaling, enabling efficient simulations of large numbers of qubits. We build upon the observations that adding extra noise to a quantum circuit makes it easier to simulate with tensor networks, and that the results can later be reliably extrapolated back to the low-noise regime of interest. These observations form the basis for a novel emulation technique that we call non-zero noise extrapolation, in analogy to the quantum error mitigation technique of zero-noise extrapolation.",

As $J_2$ increases, the magnon mode develops incommensurability. The system undergoes a first-order transition at $J_2 = 0.76 J_1$, and at that point, domain walls lead to a continuum of fractional quasi-particles or spinons. By studying small variations in $J_2$ around the transition point, we observe the confinement of spinons into bound states in the spectral function and find a smooth evolution of the spectrum into magnon modes away from the phase transition. We employ the single-mode approximation to accurately account for the dispersion of the magnon mode away from the phase transition and describe the associated continua and bound states. We extend the single-mode approximation to describe the dispersion of a spinon at the phase transition point and obtain its dispersion throughout the Brillouin zone. This allows us to relate the incommensurability at and around the transition point to the competition between a negative nearest-neighbour hopping amplitude and a positive next-nearest-neighbour one for the domain wall.",

      "abstract": "We apply the tensor cross interpolation (TCI) algorithm to solve equilibrium quantum impurity problems with high precision based on the weak-coupling expansion. The TCI algorithm, a kind of active learning method, factorizes high-dimensional integrals that appear in the perturbative expansion into a product of low-dimensional ones, enabling us to evaluate higher-order terms efficiently. This method is free from the sign problem which quantum Monte Carlo methods sometimes suffer from, and allows one to directly calculate the free energy. We benchmark the TCI impurity solver on an exactly solvable impurity model, and find good agreement with the exact solutions. We also incorporate the TCI impurity solver into the dynamical mean-field theory to solve the Hubbard model, and show that the metal-to-Mott insulator transition is correctly described with comparable accuracy to the Monte Carlo methods. Behind the effectiveness of the TCI approach for quantum impurity problems lies the fact that the integrands in the weak-coupling expansion naturally have a low-rank structure in the tensor-train representation.",

Here we describe a Matrix Product State (MPS) algorithm for characters of $S_n$. The algorithm computes an MPS encoding all irreducible characters of a given permutation. It relies on a mapping from characters of $S_n$ to quantum spin chains proposed by Crichigno and Prakash. We also provide a simpler derivation of this mapping. We complement this result by presenting a $poly(n)$ size quantum circuit that prepares the corresponding MPS, obtaining an efficient quantum algorithm for certain sampling problems based on characters of $S_n$. To assess classical hardness of these problems we present a general reduction from strong simulation (computing a given probability) to weak simulation (sampling with a small error).

Focusing on a local $U(1)$ charge, we consider symmetric initial states evolved by both local one-dimensional circuits and geometrically non-local RUCs made of two-qudit gates. We compute the entanglement asymmetry of subsystems of arbitrary size, analyzing the relaxation time scales. We show that the entanglement asymmetry of the whole system approaches its stationary value in a time independent of the system size for both local and non-local circuits. For subsystems, we find qualitative differences depending on their size. When the subsystem is larger than half of the full system, the equilibration time scales are again independent of the system size for both local and non-local circuits and the entanglement asymmetry grows monotonically in time. Conversely, when the subsystems are smaller than half of the full system, we show that the entanglement asymmetry is non-monotonic in time and that it equilibrates in a time proportional to the quantum-information scrambling time, providing a physical intuition. As a consequence, the subsystem-equilibration time depends on the locality of interactions, scaling linearly and logarithmically in the system size, respectively, for local and non-local RUCs. Our work confirms the entanglement asymmetry as a versatile and computable probe of symmetry in many-body physics and yields a phenomenological overview of entanglement-asymmetry evolution in typical non-integrable dynamics.",

This paper studies numerical integrators for such and other classes of nonlinear parametrizations $ u(t) = \\Phi(\\theta(t)) $, where the evolving parameters $\\theta(t)$ are to be computed. The primary focus is on tackling the challenges posed by the combination of stiff evolution problems and irregular parametrizations, which typically arise with neural networks, tensor networks, flocks of evolving Gaussians, and in further cases of overparametrization. We propose and analyse regularized parametric versions of the implicit Euler method and higher-order implicit Runge--Kutta methods for the time integration of the parameters in nonlinear approximations to evolutionary partial differential equations and large systems of stiff ordinary differential equations. At each time step, an ill-conditioned nonlinear optimization problem is solved approximately with a few regularized Gauss--Newton iterations. Error bounds for the resulting parametric integrator are derived by relating the computationally accessible Gauss--Newton iteration for the parameters to the computationally inaccessible Newton iteration for the underlying non-parametric time integration scheme. The theoretical findings are supported by numerical experiments that are designed to show key properties of the proposed parametric integrators.",

Here, we study the fairly unexplored territory that bridges these two extreme cases of zero and infinite temperature. We blend two established techniques for states, the Lanczos series expansion and a tensor network ansatz, uplifting them to the level of operator algebra. This allows us to efficiently simulate large system sizes for arbitrarily long timescales and to extract the temperature-dependent decay rates.

Entanglement entropy characterizes the difficulty of many-body simulation with tensor network state related methods, while the average sign measures the difficulty in many-body simulation for a variety of quantum Monte Carlo methods. Although there exist cases where one type of method works better than the other, it is desirable to find the possible correlation between entanglement and average sign for general hard strongly correlated systems regarding computational complexity. We take the doped two-dimensional Hubbard model as an example and numerically calculate the doping evolution of both the entanglement in the ground state with Density Matrix Renormalization Group and the average sign in the Auxiliary Field Quantum Monte Carlo simulation at low temperature. The results show that they are indeed correlated. The entanglement entropy (average sign) shows a peak (dip) around 20% doping, indicating that it is the difficult region for both methods. The vicinity of 20% doping is also the most intriguing region in both the Hubbard model and cuprate high-Tc superconductors where competing states with close energy intertwine with each other. Recognizing the correlation between entanglement and average sign provides new insight into our understanding of the difficulty in the simulation of strongly correlated quantum many-body systems.",

However, another quantity called reflected entropy $S_{R}$ is also supposed to be dual to two times the EWCS. A natural question is whether they are the same in holographic CFTs even though they are different in general. Previous studies have shown $E_{P} \\ge \\frac{1}{2} S_{R}^{(n)}, n \\ge2$ for random tensor networks. In this paper, we study this inequality beyond $n \\ge 2$, and we focus on the range $0 < n < 2$. However, the calculations of EoP are notoriously difficult in general. Thus, our calculations mainly focus on the free scalar theory which is close to the holographic CFTs. We generalized the previous strategy for EoP in \\cite{Takayanagi:2018sbw} to the R\\'enyi case. And we have also presented two methods for R\\'enyi reflected entropy, one is using correlators, the other one is Gaussian wavefunction ansatz. Our calculations show that the inequality still holds for $0 < n < 2$, and it may give us some insights into the equivalence of EoP and half reflected entropy in holographic CFTs.

Unlike previous approaches, our method imposes no symmetry assumptions, such as translational invariance, on the quantum systems. This technique is scalable to large systems through the use of a matrix product operator representation of the reference time evolution propagator. Our optimization routine is applied to various spin chains and fermionic systems described by the transverse-field Ising Hamiltonian, the Heisenberg Hamiltonian, and the spinful Fermi-Hubbard Hamiltonian. In these cases, our approach achieves a relative error improvement of up to four orders of magnitude for systems of 50 qubits, although our method is also applicable to larger systems. Furthermore, we demonstrate the versatility of our method by applying it to molecular systems, specifically lithium hydride, achieving an error improvement of up to eight orders of magnitude. This proof of concept highlights the potential of our approach for broader applications in quantum simulations.",

      "abstract": "Superdiffusive transport with dynamical exponent $z=3/2$ has been firmly established at finite temperature for a class of integrable systems with a non-abelian global symmetry $G$. On the inclusion of integrability-breaking perturbations, diffusive transport with $z=2$ is generically expected to hold in the limit of late time. Recent studies of the classical Haldane-Ishimori-Skylanin model have found that perturbations that preserve the global symmetry lead to a much slower timescale for the onset of diffusion, albeit with uncertainty over the exact scaling exponent. That is, for perturbations of strength $\\lambda$, the characteristic timescale for diffusion goes as $t_*\\sim \\lambda^{-\\alpha}$ for some $\\alpha$. Using large-scale matrix product state simulations, we investigate this behavior for perturbations to the canonical quantum model showing superdiffusion: the $S=1/2$ quantum Heisenberg chain. We consider a ladder configuration and look at various perturbations that either break or preserve the $SU(2)$ symmetry, leading to scaling exponents consistent with those observed in one classical study arXiv:2402.18661: $\\alpha=2$ for symmetry-breaking terms and $\\alpha=6$ for symmetry-preserving terms. We also consider perturbations from another integrable point of the ladder model with $G=SU(4)$ and find consistent results. Finally, we consider a generalization to an $SU(3)$ ladder and find that the $\\alpha=6$ scaling appears to be universal across superdiffusive systems when the perturbations preserve the non-abelian symmetry $G$.",

Among the various PEFT methods, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and its variants have gained significant attention due to their effectiveness, enabling users to fine-tune models with limited computational resources. However, the approximation gap between the low-rank assumption and desired fine-tuning weights prevents the simultaneous acquisition of ultra-parameter-efficiency and better performance. To reduce this gap and further improve the power of LoRA, we propose a new PEFT method that combines two classes of adaptations, namely, transform and residual adaptations. In specific, we first apply a full-rank and dense transform to the pre-trained weight. This learnable transform is expected to align the pre-trained weight as closely as possible to the desired weight, thereby reducing the rank of the residual weight. Then, the residual part can be effectively approximated by more compact and parameter-efficient structures, with a smaller approximation error. To achieve ultra-parameter-efficiency in practice, we design highly flexible and effective tensor decompositions for both the transform and residual adaptations. Additionally, popular PEFT methods such as DoRA can be summarized under this transform plus residual adaptation scheme. Experiments are conducted on fine-tuning Stable Diffusion models in subject-driven and controllable generation. The results manifest that our method can achieve better performances and parameter efficiency compared to LoRA and several baselines.",

Moreover, it allows an efficient computation of thermodynamic quantities and entanglement properties. We demonstrate the performance of our approach with a tree tensor network ansatz, although it can be extended to other tensor networks, and present results illustrating its effectiveness in capturing the finite-temperature properties in one- and two-dimensional scenarios.

Following quasi-adiabatic preparation, we directly observe the power-law decay of spin-spin correlations in real-space, allowing us to extract the Luttinger parameter. In the presence of an impurity, the chain exhibits tunable Friedel oscillations of the local magnetization. Moreover, by utilizing a quantum quench, we directly probe the propagation of correlations, which exhibit a light-cone structure related to the linear sound mode of the underlying TLL. Our measurements demonstrate the influence of the long-range dipolar interactions, renormalizing the parameters of TLL with respect to the case of nearest-neighbor interactions.

Our analysis reveals that an optimal potential wall height is crucial to preserve the well-localized nature of the MZM during its movement.

Additionally, we provide a comparative study of diabatic errors arising from the simultaneous versus sequential tuning of multiple gates during the MZMs movement.

By employing a non-Gaussian variational approach, we go beyond the approximation of a constant superconducting (SC) gap. We show that dynamical properties of the system can be modified qualitatively, when space and time dependent renormalization of the SC gap and electron-impurity hybridization are included. For the ground state, we find the singlet-doublet phase transition and $\\pi$-phase shifts of the SC order parameter. For dynamics, first we consider spin dynamics following an abrupt connection of the polarized impurity to the 2D bath. We find rapid relaxation of impurity polarization and directional emission of a magnetization pulse, which becomes damped as it propagates into the bulk. Then we analyze transport between two SC leads coupled through the impurity at finite bias voltage. Here we go beyond analysis of the steady state to investigate full-time dynamics following an abrupt application of the bias voltage. We uncover four distinct regimes in the transient dynamics and transport properties: (I) the AC Josephson effect regime; (II) dynamical competition between charge-density-wave (CDW) and SC orders with transient Kondo correlations; (III) the coexistence of AC and DC currents facilitated by partial Kondo screening and dynamical stabilization of the SC order; (IV) DC Kondo transport regime modified by the SC order. Regime II exhibits a dynamical transition from SC to CDW order that locally restores the U(1) symmetry. We argue that our findings for regime IV provide a theoretical explanation for the experimentally observed anomalous enhancement of DC conductance and suppression of the AC Josephson current.

We prove that scattering of a parity-invariant single photon on a qubit pair, combined with a properly engineered time variation of the qubit detuning, is not only feasible, but also more effective than strategies based on the relaxation of the excited states of the qubits. The use of tensor network methods to simulate the proposed scheme enables to include photon delays in collision models, thus opening the possibility to follow the time evolution of the full quantum system, including qubits and field, and to efficiently implement and characterize the dynamics in non-ideal cases, which turn out to be optimal for the BIC generation strategy.",

Programmable quantum processors can directly prepare and manipulate exotic quantum many-body states, offering a powerful path for exploring the physics behind these states. Here, we present an experimental exploration of the critical cluster Ising model by preparing its low-lying critical states on a superconducting processor with up to $100$ qubits. We develop an efficient method to probe the boundary $g$-function based on prepared low-energy states, which allows us to uniquely identify the nontrivial topology of the critical systems under study. Furthermore, by adapting the entanglement Hamiltonian tomography technique, we recognize two-fold topological degeneracy in the entanglement spectrum under periodic boundary condition, experimentally verifying the universal bulk-boundary correspondence in topological critical systems.

In the past, the dynamical low-rank (DLR) approximation has been repeatedly used to solve high-dimensional reaction networks by separating the network into smaller partitions. However, the partitioning of these networks was so far only done by hand. In this paper, we present a heuristic, automatic partitioning scheme based on two ingredients: the Kernighan-Lin algorithm and information entropy. Our approach is computationally inexpensive and can be easily incorporated as a preprocessing step into the existing simulation workflow. We test our scheme by partitioning Boolean reaction networks on a single level and also in a hierarchical fashion with tree tensor networks. The resulting accuracy of the scheme is superior to both partitionings chosen by human experts and those found by simply minimizing the number of reaction pathways between partitions.",

The phase diagrams under the magnetic field were also explored for these quasi-one dimensional models. For an isotropic Kitaev chain, it was found that a magnetic field polarizes the ground state except along the symmetric field angle, where the chain is found to remain gapless up to a critical field strength where it enters an intriguing soliton phase before reaching the polarized state at higher field strengths. Here we study an anisotropic Kitaev chain under a magnetic field using the density matrix renormalization group technique, where the ground state has a macroscopic degeneracy with a finite gap in the absence of the magnetic field. When the field is mainly aligned parallel to the strong bond, four-site and large unit-cell ordered phases arise. In a certain angle of the field, another ordered phase characterized by a uniform chirality with six-site periodicity emerges. We employ a perturbation theory to understand such field-induced ordered phases. The effective model uncovers the presence of transverse Ising and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions between unit cells, as well as further-neighbor Ising interaction induced by the magnetic field, which collectively explain the mechanisms behind these ordered states.

      "abstract": "Quantum state tomography (QST) remains the prevailing method for benchmarking and verifying quantum devices; however, its application to large quantum systems is rendered impractical due to the exponential growth in both the required number of total state copies and classical computational resources. Recently, the classical shadow (CS) method has been introduced as a more computationally efficient alternative, capable of accurately predicting key quantum state properties. Despite its advantages, a critical question remains as to whether the CS method can be extended to perform QST with guaranteed performance. In this paper, we address this challenge by introducing a projected classical shadow (PCS) method with guaranteed performance for QST based on Haar-random projective measurements. PCS extends the standard CS method by incorporating a projection step onto the target subspace. For a general quantum state consisting of $n$ qubits, our method requires a minimum of $O(4^n)$ total state copies to achieve a bounded recovery error in the Frobenius norm between the reconstructed and true density matrices, reducing to $O(2^n r)$ for states of rank $r<2^n$ -- meeting information-theoretic optimal bounds in both cases. For matrix product operator states, we demonstrate that the PCS method can recover the ground-truth state with $O(n^2)$ total state copies, improving upon the previously established Haar-random bound of $O(n^3)$. Simulation results further validate the effectiveness of the proposed PCS method.",

However, on existing noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices, some factors such as quantum decoherence, measurement errors, and gate operation imprecisions are unavoidable. To overcome these challenges, this study proposes an efficient noise-mitigating variational quantum eigensolver for accurate computation of molecular ground state energies in noisy environments. We design the quantum circuit with reference to the structure of matrix product states and utilize it to pre-train the circuit parameters, which ensures circuit stability and mitigates fluctuations caused by initialization. We also employ zero-noise extrapolation to mitigate quantum noise and combine it with neural networks to improve the accuracy of the noise-fitting function, which significantly eliminates noise interference. Furthermore, we implement an intelligent grouping strategy for measuring Hamiltonian Pauli strings, which not only reduces measurement errors but also improves sampling efficiency. We perform numerical simulations to solve the ground state energy of the $H_4$ molecule by using MindSpore Quantum framework, and the results demonstrate that our algorithm can constrain noise errors within the range of $\\mathcal{O}(10^{-2}) \\sim \\mathcal{O}(10^{-1})$, outperforming mainstream variational quantum eigensolvers.

Through engineering the Rydberg-dressed dipole-dipole interaction and inter-tweezer couplings, the fermionic t-J model with independently tunable exchange and hopping couplings is achieved. With the high tunability, we explore quantum many-body dynamics in the large J/t limit, a regime well beyond the conventional optical lattices and cuprates, and predict an unprecedented many-body self-pinning effect enforced by local quantum entanglement with emergent conserved quantities. The self-pinning effect leads to novel nonthermal quantum many-body dynamics, which violates eigenstate thermalization hypothesis in Krylov subspace.

A comprehensive projective symmetry group classification of fermionic mean-field Ans\\\"atze on this lattice yields 46 U(1) and 80 $\\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ states. Motivated by density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) calculations suggesting that the Shastry-Sutherland model and the square-lattice $J_{1}$-$J_{2}$ Heisenberg antiferromagnet putatively share the same QSL phase, we establish a mapping of our Ans\\\"atze to those of the square lattice. This enables us to identify the equivalent of the square-lattice QSL (Z2A$zz$13) in the Shastry-Sutherland system. Employing state-of-the-art variational Monte Carlo calculations with Gutzwiller-projected wavefunctions improved upon by Lanczos steps, we demonstrate the excellent agreement of energies and correlators between a gapless (Dirac) $\\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ spin liquid -- characterized by only few parameters -- and approaches based on neural quantum states and DMRG. Furthermore, the real-space spin-spin correlations are shown to decay with the same power law as in the $J_{1}$-$J_{2}$ square lattice model, which also hosts a $\\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ Dirac spin liquid. Finally, we apply the recently developed Keldysh formulation of the pseudo-fermion functional renormalization group to compute the dynamical spin structure factor; these correlations exhibit the features expected due to Dirac cones in the excitation spectrum, thus providing strong independent evidence for a Dirac QSL ground state. Our finding of a $d$-wave pairing $\\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ Dirac QSL is consistent with the recently observed signatures of QSL behavior in Pr$_2$Ga$_2$BeO$_7$ and outlines predictions for future experiments.",
